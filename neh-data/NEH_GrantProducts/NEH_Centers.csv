The Green Center was established at the Georgia Museum of Art (GMOA) in 2000 to address a burgeoning interest in the decorative arts of Georgia and to promote scholarship in this heretofore little-studied area of Georgia's history. The center honors Mr. Green (1909-2003), the acknowledged pioneer in the study and collection of Georgia's decorative arts, furniture in particular. The Green Center conducts original research, which it makes public through exhibitions, publications, symposia, colloquia and workshops; and assists scholars and laypersons who study and investigate the decorative arts. It has established links with colleagues and scholars, including those in other units at the University of Georgia, in the fine arts, historic preservation, sciences, and humanities, as well as with museums, scholars, collectors, and enthusiasts all over the state and beyond.","Henry D.

These spaces include the Helzel Works on Paper Study Center (HWoPSC), Leiber Conceptual Art Study Center (LCASC), Cahill Asian Art Study Center (CAASC), Film Library &amp; Study Center, and a small screening room with a projection booth.  2) endow a new position, Collections Engagement Associate, that plays in important role in increasing awareness and availability of works held in the study centers.   These project outcomes, all of which benefit the UC Berkeley campus, researchers, scholars, and the general public, enhance access to the institution's distinct art and film collections and help advance the important role of the humanities in academic and everyday life.","UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive 2120 Oxford Street #2250 Berkeley, CA 94720-2250",Lawrence Rinder,BAMPFA Study and Education Centers,,,,,2016
