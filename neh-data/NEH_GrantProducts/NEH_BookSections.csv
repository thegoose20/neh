Much less well known to modern scholarship, by contrast, is the rival and contemporaneous expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the lands of the Indian Ocean littoral, a process which began with Sultan Selim I's conquest of Egypt in 1517, and which would continue throughout the rest of the sixteenth century.  Because the Ottoman state and the merchant communities of the Indian Ocean shared the same religion, most modern scholars have simply assume that they enjoyed a kind of de facto familiarity with one another as well.   In reality, the early sixteenth century Ottomans were in many ways even less aware of the geography, history and civilization of the Indian Ocean than were their contemporary Portuguese rivals.  The subsequent development of direct contact between the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim principalities and trading communities of the Indian Ocean thus represents a kind of Ottoman 'discovery' of an entirely new part of the globe, and one which corresponds in many ways to the much better documented European discoveries of the same period.",,"Bridenthal, Renate, Casale, Giancarlo, Bentley, Jerry","Seascapes: Maritime Histories, Littoral Cultures and Trans-Oceanic Exchanges","Casale, Giancarlo",,,,University of Hawaii Press,,,The Ottoman 'Discovery' of the Indian Ocean in the Sixteenth Century,2007

411,RA-50033-05,"The paper presents the goals and results of excavations at the Early Iron Age and Archaic site of Azoria in northeastern Crete. Recent excavations at the site (2002-2006) demonstrate that the seventh century B.C. was an important period of culture change in which the Early Iron Age landscape was substantially transformed. The formalization of civic architecture and the reorganization of civic and domestic space are linked to the changing economics of food provisioning in the civic sphere and differentiation of processing and consumption patterns in various domestic and civic contexts. Public places such as an andreion, temple, and an early civic banquet hall were communal, but each was also to some degree exclusionary, serving to order the status of households and clans, and modes of social interaction. New civic buildings seem to form new contexts for elite consumption, negotiating political power, and asserting or claiming social identity in the early city. The paper focuses on the diachronic changes in the formal structure of the site, economic systems, and social organization from the Early Iron Age until the establishment of the city in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C.

I argue that such regimens functioned as markers of belonging to the Brahmanical religion and ‘pure' Årya society, while also offering the ordinary householder a form of personal piety that promised all the rewards of the old priestly ‘high cult. At the same time, disciplinary regimens provided a traditionally recognized framework for mendicant movements and new deity cults, which helped carry Brahmanical texts, ideals, and practices, via royal patronage, into new regions in India beyond the Ganges Valley and on into Southeast Asia. The second part of this essay will consider what early inscriptions can show us about how Brahmanical doctrine and practice were projected in the public sphere, noting instances in which particular subjects, texts, and especially disciplinary practices are cited, and observing that the grants and foundations recorded in these inscriptions helped spread the tradition and enhance its prestige.

743,FB-37575-02,"Designed as a corrective to colonial literary histories that have excluded Native voices, this anthology brings together a variety of primary texts produced by the Algonquian peoples of New England during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and very early nineteenth centuries. Included among these written materials and objects are letters, signatures, journals, baskets, pictographs, confessions, wills, and petitions, each of which represents a form of authorship. Together they demonstrate the continuing use of traditional forms of memory and communication and the lively engagement of Native peoples with alphabetic literacy during the colonial period. Each primary text is accompanied by an essay that places it in context and explores its significance. Written by leading scholars in the field, these readings draw on recent trends in literary analysis, history, and anthropology to provide an excellent overview of the field of early Native studies. They are also intended to provoke discussion and open avenues for further exploration by students and other interested readers. Above all, the texts and commentaries gathered in this volume provide an opportunity to see Native American literature as a continuity of expression that reflects choices made long before contact and colonization, rather than as a nineteenth- or even twentieth-century invention.  Contributors include Heidi Bohaker, Heather Bouwman, Joanna Brooks, Kristina Bross, Stephanie Fitzgerald, Sandra Gustafson, Laura Arnold Leibman, Kevin McBride, David Murray, Laura Murray, Jean O Brien, Ann Marie Plane, Philip Round, Jodi Schorb, David Silverman, and Hilary E.

877,FB-37629-02,"John Durang was the first American-born theater professional to make the stage his life. Durang was born on January 6, 1768, shortly after his parents' emigration to Pennsylvania from the Alsace in France. Durang's career as a theater professional unfolded primarily in Philadelphia, then America's major city.  His movement work encompassed the popular dances of theatrical interludes , ballets, pantomimes, and circus acts.   Remarkably for an actor of this period, Durang also wrote a Memoir, held at the York County Heritage Trust, and published in 1966. It includes Durang's memories of his life and career, ""day books"" of his work as a manager in the latter part of his career, and – of most interest to us for this project – a set of 8 watercolors by Durang himself. Six of his illustrations are self-portraits in performance. The following is a list of the images he included of his dancing roles: 1.John Durang in character of the Dwarf Metamorphosed. 2.John Durang in character of a Hornpipe. 3.John Durang in character of the Dutch Fisherman. 4.John Durang in character of a Highland Fling — Ballet of Auld Robin Gray. 5.John Durang in character of Harlequin, Animation scene, in five positions. 6.John Durang in character of a Pas seul à Vestris.

These accounts confirm that the emperor Akbar (d. 1605) was fascinated by yogis and their practices and beliefs.  I argue that these accounts should be understood in terms of the emerging Mughal imperialism of the time, which involved a process of mutual incorporation--a 'taking possession' of both territory and persons, by the emperor from above and the yogis from below--as each side 'domesticated' the other.",printed book,William R.

The primary argument is that current ways of distinguishing so-called mainstream work (often associated with Romantic poetry and lyricism) from so-called experimental work (often self-described as anti-Romantic) in the U.S. are not ultimately useful, in part because literary genealogies are complex and shift over time or between cultures.  In particular, past poetry (here, primarily, Wordsworth's and Williams's) is re-read in different ways by different reading communities.

The paper uses an ethnohistorical case study of Maasai activists in Tanzania to explore the centrality of the state to both indigenous rights and neoliberalism, and the consequent challenges to the political struggles of historically marginalized peoples.  It traces and explains three phases of the relationship between Maasai and the Tanzanian state: 1) a deeply modernist, paternalist postcolonial state that treated Maasai as ""subjects"" rather than ""citizens,"" and left little space for Maasai political engagement;  2) the emergence and embrace of indigenous rights and international advocacy by Maasai activists in the 1990s, and 3) a recent shift by Maasai activists from discourses of indigeneity to discourses of livelihoods, and from international to national advocacy.  These shifting political strategies and positionings within international and national debates inform, challenge, and complicate ongoing theoretical and political debates about the struggles of transnational social movements, the contours of cosmopolitics, and the enduring political salience of the state.",,Dorothy L.

Attention to countermovement-state coalitions is even more rare.  This paper contributes to filling this latter void by illuminating a particular type of countermovement-state coalition formation process: business leaders who formed their own private militias and entered into coalitions with local governments to suppress the nascent labor movement during the late 19th-century.  Examining primary and secondary evidence for several northern industrial cities during this period, I ask several key questions: How did these militias form and become allied with municipal authorities?  What were the major conditions that contributed to these coalition formations?  What sort of historical trajectory did these coalitions follow?  Answers to these questions inform our understanding of elite countermovement-state coalition processes and how private employers and state authorities often worked in tandem in the policing of labor during its early phases as a challenging movement.

In Seattle, this history began with the rapid physical growth of the city at the turn of the twentieth century.  Redirecting rivers, filling estuaries, and building parks completely reworked the landscapes of the city and its environs for the benefit of middle-class outdoor recreation.

Scholars have noted use of her content but not her overarching fiction of intervening in a classical hero's life to forestall his death or her view of men's misfortunes as the result of their own life choices, not a capricious goddess alone.

The Bibell has been called ""Lydgatian"" but never before analyzed for evidence that Lydgate authored it, because the single manuscript was produced outside his lifetime, but my work has shown that manuscript to be a copy of an earlier original, leaving open the possibility that the translation itself was made much earlier and contemporary with Lydgate.",,Misty Schieberle,Christine de Pizan and English Literary History (in progress),,,,,,,,Chapter 3: Lydgate and the Epistre Othea Reconsidered; Chapter 4: Lydgate and the Litel Bibell of Knyghthod (both in draft/in progress),2022

To the extent that physicians disregard the personhood of the enslaved women entrusted to their care, Roth argues, or seem impervious to their pain in their clinical practice, they formalize and authorize the notion of their subhumanity. Roth therefore exhorts fellow researchers today to read between the lines of these medical reports and to practice a ""corporeal reading"" that might appropriately acknowledge the visceral and imaginary impact of the medi- cal archive and thereby accord these subjects the racial justice historically denied them.

Strauss' inquiries into this problem lead him to examine earlier confrontations, notably by Rousseau and Nietzsche, with the difficulties in political perception and judgment as they emerge from Enlightenment constitutionalism. Strauss' inquiries into these problems and their attendant crises lead to a re-examination of ancient constitutional philosophy, notably that of Aristotle's ""Politics"", from which modernity rebelled. The consequence of Strauss' work leads to a renewed undertanding of the tasks of constitution making as undertaken by the American Founders, and in particular Madison and Hamilton, who explored these issues in both ancient and modern political philosophy. While their work in Founding is now so much placed in question, there remains little understanding, even in the discipline of political science, of the fundamental problems that the Founders confronted and that always need exploring in order to grasp the difficulties at issue.

As symbols, the petroglyphs assume an important dynamic in social processes structuring the cultural identities and collective memories of contemporary tribal communities. For some, petroglyphs are reminders of who they are, from where they have come, what their responsibilities are, and what their relationship was, is, and should be with the land, environment, and their neighbors. At times, those memories are shared among tribal groups, yet in other instances they splinter along cultural or political lines. When that occurs, the petroglyphs can become bound up in contestations over the ownership of place and authenticity of history. Beyond the collective memories of tribes, and generally unaligned with them, is a nationalistic collective memory concerning Native Americans.

He acted on several fronts to keep philosophical concerns alive in mathematical circles and to tear down walls separating the concerns of philosophically-minded mathematicians and mathematically-minded philosophers. This is a contribution to integrating Hilbert's ideas as found in unpublished and published writings into the philosophical discussions where they belong in order to bring important issues back into focus and open new avenues in philosophy, because philosophers are still trying to solve problems that have their roots in problems that have remain unsolved since his time. I study his fight for the philosophers Edmund Husserl and Leonard Nelson. Then I set out what Hilbert called the basic philosophical position and look at his views on theory of knowledge, experience, pure thought, finitism, the axiomatic method, the a priori, the ideal, pre-established harmony, a priori intuition, truth, logical consistency and existence, and his avowed Kantianism.",,Claire Ortiz Hill,"Husserl and Awakened Reason: Critical Essays on Mathematics, Science and Phenomenology",Iulian Apostolescu,Forthcoming,,,Springer,,,"""Hilbert's Fight for Philosophy""",2021
23482,HK-250616-16,"Before digital technology, most of us had access to manuscripts by way of photographic plates and critical editions. Those few who had the privilege of handling the manuscript itself faced their own challenges. Digital technology opens new possibilities for extending and improving the role of manuscripts in our research and teaching. The impact of digitizing manuscripts is unmistakable, but digitizing is not an end in itself. We should think about why we digitize and what we expect a digital simulation of a manuscript to be able to do. In turn, this leads to consideration of how to digitize and what to do with the digital simulation. This essay discusses three priorities I consider most essential when digitizing manuscripts for the benefit of research and teaching in biblical literature. I draw from my experience directing the Jubilees Palimpsest Project, which faced challenges in these areas in the pursuit of the study of the only copy of Jubilees in Latin and the only copy anywhere of the Testament (or Assumption) of Moses. I started off with an interest in recovering more text from the manuscript, which dates from the fifth century and which has been abused to the point of illegibility since that time. As the project progressed, I realized the potential for the digitization of manuscripts to do much more than add to critical editions.",,Todd R.

This essay describes an integrated set of advances in image capture, processing, and dissemination that improves upon first-hand experience and harnesses the power of the web to connect people and data. Illegible manuscripts are an area of particular interest among all the cultural heritage artifacts that benefit from these advances. Spectral RTI makes it possible to distinguish letters and other evidence of use based on traces as subtle as the corrosion of parchment where ink had once been and the spectral signature of ink stains that cannot be distinguished by the human eye.

23484,HK-250616-16,"Spectral Reflectance Transformation Imaging (Spectral RTI) combines the advantages of Spectral Imaging with the advantages of Reflectance Transformation Imaging into a single consistent data set. For each pixel both color and texture properties are known and can be processed and visualized together. The major advantages gathered from spectral imaging are improved spatial resolution, color resolution, color range beyond the visible spectrum, processing enhancements, and objectively accurate color. The major advantages gathered from RTI are interactivity and enhanced visualization of texture. The combination is greater than the sum of its parts in as much as color and texture information are complementary. For example, even a single letter in an illegible manuscript may have some trace of writing from remaining ink and another trace in the outline of the corrosion into the surface of the parchment where ink had once been. A human user can visualize the information together in a single view for a more complete and natural experience of the manuscript. The consistent combined data also has potential to improve machine learning applied to manuscripts. The cost in time and equipment of Spectral RTI is less than the sum of each. As of 2017, spectral imaging systems can vary from a few thousand to over a hundred thousand dollars, with options for adding RTI of comparable sophistication adding approximately ten percent across the range of cost. There is no cost for the processing software. The cost in time is less than the sum of each because mounting, focus, metadata entry, etc., is done only once for the complete data set.

23514,FEL-258168-18,"This essay begins by foregrounding two aspects of Jacques Viegas's 1704 trial concerning ""bolsas de mandinga."" First, that his pouch—like many others—contained paper as a key constitutive element; and second, that the pouch he used was meant to protect him from bodily violation. Responding to Hortense Spillers's outlining of the intimate relationship between archival writings and markings of violence against the enslaved, the chapter investigates the common incorporation of written papers in mandinga pouches as challenges and reckonings with imperial archives, inquisitorial procedure, and the expectation of enslavement as a condition defined by embodied violence. Providing a series of close analyses of never-before published written papers, drawings, and orations, the chapter first traces how the act of inscribing designs and words with ink onto paper and placing them inside the mandinga pouches emerged in conversation with wider practices of inscription in the African diaspora. Yet the papers also demonstrate how their users strategically re-conceptualized, or took advantage of, fluid relationships between papers, bodies, and textual evocations in order to respond to otherwise contemporary theorizations of the simultaneous ""hypervisibility"" and ""invisibility"" of enslaved subjects and the obfuscated legibility of Black histories in the archives of slavery.",,Matthew Francis Rarey,Black Modernisms in the Transatlantic World,"Huey Copeland, Steven Nelson",0300269773,https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300269772/black-modernisms-in-the-transatlantic-world/,,Yale University Press,,,Leave No Mark: Blackness and Inscription in the Inquisitorial Archive,2023
23598,HC-279973-21,"This chapter investigates the origins of settler colonist fiction that began in the Meiji era and constituted one of the most tangible forms by which modern literature participated in the Empire of Japan's broader expansionist aims. Contrary to the conventional wisdom which takes for granted that this genre was exclusively set in Japan's burgeoning empire in Asia, from 1908 until the onset of World War II settler colonist fiction expressly promoted emigration overseas to sovereign nations in South America as an essential part of its diversified strategy to alleviate the burdens of overpopulation in the home islands. The earliest identifiable work of settler colonist fiction is Horiuchi Shinsen's ""South America Bound"" (Nanbei yuki), which appeared in the inaugural May 1908 issue of the journal Colonization World (Shokumin sekai), by Tokyo-based magazine publisher Seiko Zasshi Sha.  Although largely forgotten today, both text and genre attest to the pressures confronted by the rural communities marked in Japanese national-imperial discourse as ""surplus population"" (jinko kajo), including those whose seasonal labor ""working away from home"" (dekasegi) temporarily brought them into the cities. Enduring for only five issues between May and September 1908, Colonization World nevertheless set in motion production of a lowbrow, but ideologically potent, literary corpus in pro-expansionist and general interest magazines that grew well into the early 1940s. It operated within a feeder system that promised a degree of state sponsorship and oversight, while maintaining the primacy of ambition, skill, and luck in navigating the perils of earning one's fortune abroad.",,Seth Jacobowitz,,"Pedro Iacobelli, Sidney Xu Lu",,https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/the-japanese-empire-and-latin-america/,,University of Hawaii Press,,,South America Bound: Settler Colonist Fiction of the Meiji Era,2023

One ended up influencing the composition of an Arabic geographical text and the other had an impact on a segment of the Kitab al-masalik wa-al-mamalik (Book of routes and realms) KMMS Islamic mapping tradition. Each speaks to crucial sides of translation: interpretation, intention, and impact. These are the sides that I focus on in this chapter.  This analysis provides us with an opportunity to explore the question of Islamo-Christian cartographic connections. Did medieval European maps influence the Islamic ones or vice versa? Or were they mutually exclusive? It is one of the major unresolved debates in the history of cartog raphy. Scholars fall on both sides of the divide. A definitive answer to the question has been hampered by the lack of extant examples demonstrating Islamo-Christian cartographic connections. A decade ago a medieval European T-O map labeled in Arabic came back into the limelight after a forty- year hiatus and recently I identified a KMMS geographic atlas as having been produced in the late twelfth century Norman court of Sicily.

Muslim carto-geographical scholars from the tenth century CE onward drew on Greek, Babylonian, Coptic, Syriac, Sassanian, Indian, Chinese, and Turkic knowledge to produce a new genre of detailed maps of the known world. There are hundreds of medieval Islamic maps in oriental manuscript collections worldwide, many of them unpublished. Until recently these maps lay virtually untouched, often deliberately ignored on the grounds that they are not mimetically accurate representations of the world. This perspective overlooks the great value of these images as representations of the way medieval Muslims perceived their world. The abundance of extant copies produced in locales across the Islamic world for eight centuries testifies to the enduring importance of these maps.

The pluractional in Gta? can occur in all of the typical subject contexts associated with pluractionals cross-linguistically, in Chadic languages like Bole (Gimba 2000, 2001): that is, several subjects acting one by one, several subject acting iteratively on the same object, subject subjects acting iteratively on several objects, one subject acting on several objects, one subject repeatedly doing the same action. However, some features of Gta? pluractional marking are more noteworthy from a typological perspective.  Thus, the pluractional marker in Gta? is affixal but not obligatory as such insofar as it does not always occur when one might expect it and speakers will accept sentences without it as grammatical; it occurs in its own templatic slot in the verb template after the Aspect and Aktionsart categories and before the finite/non-finite mood marker; it can occur with numerals; it can occur with plural and dual marked subjects NPs; it occurs with verbs of motion commonly; it occurs with  verbs of speaking and mental action most commonly; it often occurs at the end and beginning of narratives; it can occur sentence initially in a non-finite forms in tail-head linkage structures; it can occur with serialized verbs; and it is used in combination with ‘live' as a conventionalized story ending.",,Gregory D.

The first section discusses some of the city's markets, the main avenues by which art, objects, and commodities moved between artisan and household, and between households. The second section provides a brief survey of Ottoman writing about crafts and craftspeople, and about objects. Sources reveal abiding preoccupations: abundance, quality, and suitability. These notions influenced discussions of objects, and on attitudes toward their makers, buyers, and sellers.

In both cases, forms of mediated communication give the dead a continuing voice in society through a participatory performance involving the medium—a person whose consciousness is suspended in a state of trance, or a set of algorithms—the deceased, and an audience. Mediumship becomes a theater in which audiences both desire and interrogate the capabilities of necro-communication technology. The chapter attends to these technologies' implied models of selfhood, which disaggregate mental content—software—from the vehicle of its expression—hardware—in the tradition of Cartesian dualism. The chapter argues that the technologies in question inevitably structure, in concerning ways, political notions of possessive individualism, which become commoditized in the shift from human-performed mediumship to selfhood instantiated in proprietary software products.",subscription,Alicia Puglionesi,Media Ventriloquism: How Audiovisual Technologies Transform the Voice-Body Relationship,"Shannon Wong Lerner, Jaimie Baron, Jennifer Fleeger",9780197563625,https://academic.oup.com/book/41115/chapter-abstract/350420178?redirectedFrom=fulltext,"Oxford University Press webpage for the chapter, ""Echoes down the years: technologies of mediumship and immortality,"" which appears in the book, Media Ventriloquism: How Audiovisual Technologies Transform the Voice-Body Relationship.",Oxford University Press,https://academic.oup.com/book/41115,"Oxford University Press webpage for book, Media Ventriloquism: How Audiovisual Technologies Transform the Voice-Body Relationship",Echoes Down the Years: Technologies of Mediumship and Immortality,2021

Ballengee, represents an important step toward thinking about the production and analysis of the soundscapes of documentary film, all while exploring a range of social, cultural, technological, and theoretical questions relevant to current trends in Global South studies. Written by a diverse set of authors, including filmmakers, academics, and cultural critics, the ten essays in this book provide fresh evaluations of the place of music and sound in documentary films outside the European-American milieu. On the whole, the authors illuminate how the invention of documentary film was at first a product of the colonialist project. Yet over time, access to filmmaking technologies led to the creation of documentary films relevant for local communities and national identities. In this sense, documentary film in the Global South might be broadly defined as a mode of personally or politically mediated storytelling that, by one route or another, has become a useful and recognizable means of memorializing traumatic histories and critiquing everyday lived experience.

24121,RA-285526-22,"Human-fashioned boundaries transform spaces by introducing dualisms, bifurcations, creative symbioses, contradictions, and notions of inclusion and exclusion. The Buddhist boundaries considered in this book, simas—a term found in South and Southeast Asian languages and later translated into East Asian languages—come in various shapes and sizes and can be established on land or in bodies of water. Sometimes, the word sima refers not only to a ceremonial boundary, but the space enclosed by the boundary, or even the markers (when they are used) that denote the boundary.  Simas were established early on as places where core legal acts (kamma), including ordination, of the monastic community (sangha) took place according to their disciplinary codes. Simas continue to be deployed in the creation of monastic lineages and to function in diverse ways for monastics and non-monastics alike. As foundations of Buddhist religion, simas are used to sustain, revitalize, or reform Buddhist practices, notions of identity, and conceptualizations of time and history. In the last few decades, scholarly awareness of and expertise on simas has developed to a point where a volume like this one, which examines simas across numerous cultural contexts and scholarly fields of inquiry, is both possible and needed. Sima traditions expressed in the Theravada cultures of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka constitute the dominant focus of the work; a chapter on East Asia raises questions of historical transmission beyond these areas.

24151,FEL-273562-21,"To appear in Spinoza in Germany: Political and Religious Thought across the Long Nineteenth Century, edited by Jason M. Yonover and Kristin Gjesdal, Oxford University Press.  This chapter explores the influence of Spinoza's philosophy both on Salomé's early philosophy of life, before her encounter with psychoanalysis, and on her later work in psychoanalysis. It highlights how the Spinozistic elements of her thought mark a continuity throughout her work, despite shifts in terminology.  More broadly, Salomé's Spinozism could even be seen as a connecting link between the two movements to which she was closest, namely Lebensphilosophie and psychoanalysis.  After a brief biographical sketch of her early encounter with Spinoza's philosophy and her later turn to psychoanalysis in Section One, Section Two of the chapter examines three Spinozistic themes in Salomé's thought: first her conception of the primordial ground (Urgrund) of life as the all-unity (All-Einheit), which is compared with Spinoza's divine substance and the psychoanalytic concept of the Unconscious (2.1 and 2.2); second her psycho-somatic parallelism as two ways of representing life, which can be seen as building upon Spinoza's account of mind and body (2.3); and third her account of the ethical dimension of human life, which has echoes of Spinoza's theory of the affects and perfection (2.4). Salomé brings these three Spinozistic elements to bear in different areas of her work, such as in her accounts of God and religion, of eroticism and sexuality, of women and gender, and of human creativity and artistic productivity. Her most original contribution to the philosophical foundations of psychoanalysis is to replace Freud's dualism on several levels with monism in the Spinozist sense, leading her to an original account of human self-development based on the assumption of a non-pathological primary narcissism and the parallelism of mind and body.",,Katharina Kraus,Spinoza in Germany: Political and Religious Thought across the Long Nineteenth Century,Jason M.

In response to these issues, we have changed how we approach the liberal arts, shifting from a traditional ""Great Books"" curriculum to an interdisciplinary focus that immerses students in an environment that fully integrates STEM with the humanities. With this approach, students learn how STEM and the humanities are linked, mutually dependent and how they continually affect our world and society. Our pedagogical innovation includes experiential learning, team-taught courses, first-year and summit experiences, non-traditional coursework, study abroad opportunities, and co-curricular programs.

Colonoware provides evidence about the persistence and mobility of Indigenous communities in the river valley who are otherwise virtually absent from the documents.

Colonoware may also provide insight into the experiences of Indigenous from places beyond the Rappahannock River valley but who found themselves enslaved on the river valley's plantations.

The contributors ask critical questions about historic preservation and commemoration methods used by modern societies and their impact on the perception and identity of the people they supposedly remember, who are generally not consulted in the commemoration process. They discuss dichotomies of history and memory, place and displacement, public spectacle and private engagement, and reconciliation and re-appropriation of the heritage of indigenous people shown in these monuments. While the case studies deal with North American indigenous experience—from California to Virginia, and from the Southwest to New England and the Canadian Maritime—they have implications for dealings between indigenous peoples and nation states worldwide.",,"Colwell-Chanthaphonh, Chip, Anyon, Roger, Ferguson, T.

Manuscript evidence of the learned culture of monastic and cathedral schools is still relatively unknown to the readers of this recent literature, despite what it has to reveal about relationships between Christians and Jews in the ninth-century Spanish March.

Sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, with two grants in the Education and Technology programs (1999-2000 and 2002-03), the DW is now part of the Virtual Humanities Lab and is well established as a reliable online resource for teachers, students and general readers, interested in exploring this book in electronic form, in its original language and in translation. It features a modular encyclopedic apparatus, built collaboratively by scholars, teachers and students, and including a pedagogy module for the benefit of teachers and students alike. In this paper, after describing the original features and the various stages in the design, construction and development of this resource, the authors reflect upon the ten years of its existence: the challenges they have faced in building it and keeping it up to date; the response they have received from the academic community and the public at large; the feedback created by its use, inside and outside the classroom. They also focus on other  theoretical issues for any project of this kind, which emphasizes the independent learning process and the ""exploration"" of a text within a body of materials designed to facilitate the students' own comprehension of the interrelation of literature and other areas of human endeavor.

(This is also a timely project, since 2007 is the bicentennial of Garibaldi's birth - 1807). The Panorama was intended as a  ""moving"" picture--audiences watched as illustrations of Garibaldi's life were cranked before them in a special circular building (London Leicester Square's popular Barker Panorama theatre). We are now reanimating this object on a digital platform: we will recreate a virtual simulation of this spectacle, allowing the user to ""scroll"" through the panorama and listen to a bilingual voiceover narrative based on the original narrative (also acquired by the Brown library) that we are in the process of transcribing and translating into Italian; we will also make the manuscript available, both images and transcription, on VHL for scholars interested in exploring the panorama as a unique  historical source, in its connections to other contemporary popular media, such as biographies, novels, newspapers, etc.",,Massimo Riva,Using New Technologies to Explore Cultural Heritage,,,http://www.neh.gov/digitalhumanities/Conference 07Oct/DH Conference.html,,National Endowment for the Humanities,,,Toward Experimental Scholarly Modes in the Humanities,2007

1248,FB-37593-02,"The conception of truth proposed by Martin Heidegger's Being and Time is both provocative and problematic. On the one hand, Heidegger provides a way to reconnect technical accounts of truth with the cultural practices and social institutions from which these accounts take distance. On the other hand, Heidegger takes such a dim view of public communication that attaining truth becomes the inexplicable privilege of ""authentic"" existence. This essay aims to fashion an alternative conception of truth that frees Heidegger's insights from their reactionary garb. While agreeing with Heidegger that asserting is a mode of interpreting, I take issue with his description of the supposedly derivative character of assertions. Similarly, while endorsing Heidegger's claim that the agreement between assertion and object (what I call ""correctness"") derives from a more comprehensive process of disclosure (what I call ""truth""), I criticize how he traces this derivation. In response, I propose to conceive of truth as a process of life-giving disclosure to which a differentiated array of cultural practices and products contribute in distinct and indispensable ways. What distinguishes true disclosure from false is not the authenticity with which human beings face the possibility of their own impossibility (their so-called ""freedom toward death"").  Rather it is their life-promoting and life-sustaining fidelity to that which they hold in common and which holds them in common. The pursuit of assertoric correctness is one important but limited way in which such fidelity occurs.

It argues that the process of this assignment can be best described as the result of the gradual institutionalization of the juridical construction of knowledge.  Because juridically constructed causes often preclude real social causes – which include, at a minimum, the agency of creditors and indebted states, institutional settings, and structural conditions – they are an inaccurate and inadequate basis for social scientific inquiry.  The paper serves as what critical naturalists call an explanatory critique because it examines how the dominant normative discourse about a social practice (e.g., debt settlement practices) not only justifies the existing order and the power relations that surround a practice but also contradicts a scientific explanation for the practice that clarifies the causal mechanism.

Five of these categories the exegete has to relate exactly in the way they were established by the consensus of earlier exegetes: reading, philology, grammatical syntax, composition, and occasion of revelation of the Qur?anic text. The other three categories (meanings, evidences, and decrees) represent aspects where the exegete, as being under a divine obligation, has to demonstrate his own ability at rational inquiry to dislodge the meanings and the legal and theological implications of the Qur?an.

1551,FA-55153-10,"This essay reconstructs the recent history of pain in childbirth, a universal physiological phenomenon intertwined with the socio-cultural context in which it unfolds. It focuses on the period from the 1950s through the 1970s, a time of flux in the understanding of childbirth pain within the medical profession and the general public. This era witnessed an emphasis on the role of female psychology in obstetric pain. Two similar psychological approaches to obstetric pain emerged: natural childbirth, promoted by British physician Grantly Dick-Read, and psychoprophylaxis, developed by Soviet neuropsychologist I. Z. Vel'vovskii and popularized in the West by French obstetrician Fernand Lamaze. In an effort to highlight trans-national influences and national idiosyncrasies, I take a comparative approach to the meanings attributed to childbirth pain in France and the United States, viewing them against related relevant developments in the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and tracing the ways in which the dynamic, dialogic clinical encounter between medical practitioners and their patients inscribed shifting social meanings and values on labor pain.",,Paula A.

1577,FT-52199-04,"In 1453-54, 313 witnesses testified at a Brittany inquest into the sanctity of Vincent Ferrer.  A number of witnesses at the canonization inquest testified about the miraculous cure in 1425 of one of the town's more prominent citizens, a client of Duke Pierre, a man named Perrinus Hervei, also known as Grasset.  Although in Perrinus's own testimony, he simply had gone out of his mind until placed on Vincent Ferrer's tomb, other witnesses were adamant that what they had seen was a case of demonic possession.  This article examines the testimony about Perrinus's miraculous healing as lens through which to view the nascent cult of Vincent Ferrer in Brittany. The timing of Perrinus's cure, as well as its prominence in the Brittany testimony, suggests its importance in the formation of the cult of Vincent Ferrer.  Furthermore, the testimony reveals the way in which various Bretons were attempting to shape the cult of the holy man on behalf of whose canonization they were testifying.  Some of the testimony indicates a desire to impugn the reputation of the Carmelites, whose activities had come under question in mid-fifteenth-century Brittany.  Other testimony underscores connections between the cult of Vincent Ferrer and the dukes of Brittany, who sought to gain a sacred legitimacy through stressing their ties to the holy preacher.   The testimony also hints at the ways in which promoters of Vincent's cult worked to publicize this and other miracles, particularly in the years leading up to the canonization inquest. Finally, the testimony about Perrinus's cure helps to reveal social networks in fifteenth-century Vannes.",,Laura Ackerman Smoller,Voices from the Bench: The Narratives of Lesser Folk in Medieval Trials.,Michael Goodich,1403966915 978,http://www.worldcat.org/title/voices-from-the-bench-the-narratives-of-lesser-folk-in-medieval-trials/oclc/61479614&amp;referer=brief results,WorldCat entry.,Palgrave-MacMillan,,," “A Case of Demonic Possession in Fifteenth-Century Brittany:  Perrin Hervé and the Nascent Cult of Vincent Ferrer.” ",2006

2002,FT-58658-11,"Rites of investiture are critical opportunities for demonstrating, or at least simulating, the legitimate and orderly transfer of power. Sanctioned by precedent and often by a state religion, they are moments of peak political drama for which a substantial audience is required. Although such rituals might have a hidden, esoteric component, it is almost inconceivable that they could dispense with revealed stages in which the newly invested lord emerges to the acclaim of his subjects. &#x0D;   It is logical, therefore, that plazas be a central focus in the search for arenas of investiture in the cityscapes of ancient Mesoamerica. Crowd capacity, restrictions of entry and visibility, and associated architecture are all important considerations, but without associated iconographic or textual evidence, definitive identification is often difficult. This paper examines investiture rituals for which we do have textual information, primarilyfrom the Basin of Mexico, Tlaxcala, and Puebla, and then argues for their application to sites falling within the broader ""Toltec"" tradition. (By this is meant cities following a political ideology first defined at Teotihuacan and then widely disseminated after its fall.) One lesson of these texts is that the investitures of paramounts and of their lords (tetecuhtin among Nahua groups) had many points in common and apparently used many of the same facilities, thus justifying their architectural investment and explaining associated iconography. &#x0D;   Sub-royal investiture is particularly interesting in that rites frequently reaffirm not only the ties of vassal to paramount, but also the broader civic ties linking barrio residents (e.g., calpoleh) to their immediate lord (e.g., tecuhtli) and to the polity as a whole (e.g., altepetl). Such rites were often carried out at various locales, potentially providing at least a partial explanation for the distribution and articulation of plaza space throughout a site. &#x0D; ",,William Ringle,Mesoamerican Plazas,"Kenichiro Tsukamoto, Takeshi Inomata/",,,,,,,Plazas and Patios of the Feathered Serpent,2012

2119,RQ-50431-10,"In 1573, Joannes Latinus (Juan Latino)—a former slave who rose to prominence in mid-sixteenth century Granada as a Latin educator— issued a volume of commemorative poetry about the Battle of Lepanto (October 7, 1571).  In this epochal naval clash, the Holy League Alliance comprised of Venice, Spain, and the Papacy attained an unexpected and resounding victory over the feared Ottoman navy.  By publishing his Lepanto commemoration, Latinus became the first writer born in sub-Saharan Africa to publish a book of poems in Europe.  The cornerstone of this volume is a two-book Vergilian epic, the Austrias Carmen.  An examination of this poem reveals signposts of modernity's fraught emergence in the Mediterranean.  Most immediately, Latinus's vivid Latin hexameters record how the Holy League Alliance's aggressive deployment of newer weapons technologies overwhelmed the Ottoman navy, which relied on the traditional military skills of its famed archers.  Throughout the poem, the freedman taps into the natural connection between epic poiesis and imperial ideology in order to reflect on cultural and political flashpoints Lepanto revealed.  In a celebratory vein, the poetic voice hails the naval victory as the dawn of a new European imperium anchored in the Roman church and Spanish military power.  Yet a web of allusions to the Aeneid mourns the high costs of empire building.  In one particularly deft imitation of Vergil's epic, the poetic voice exposes the tactically and morally dubious infighting that divided the Spanish forces, as soldiers and their commanders sought to claim captured Ottoman combatants as slaves.  This reflection on the victors' inglorious transformation from fighters to slave traders strikes a marked contrast to other Spanish poets of Lepanto, who do not directly narrate this post-battle contest.",,"Wright, Elizabeth R.","Poiesis and Modernity in the Old and New Worlds,","Middlebrook, Leah, Cascardi, Anthony",9780826518354,,,Vanderbilt University Press,http://www.vanderbiltuniversitypress.com/books/445/poiesis-and-modernity-in-the-old-and-new-worlds,,"“Scrutinizing Early Modern Warfare in Latin Hexameters: The Austrias Carmen of Joannes Latinus (Juan Latino).”  ",2012

It is quite remarkable that prehistoric pithoi from the Greek mainland have not received a thorough treatment so far, in contrast to their Cretan or Cypriot counterparts. The article attempts to fill partially the gap and to show the potential of such a study for approaching wider issues of social, economic, and political developments of LBA/EIA Central Greece.&#x0D; The majority of the pithoi derive from the site of Mitrou. Fragments from two other sites located nearby—the settlement of Kynos and the sanctuary at Kalapodi—complete our dataset.

These are the Early Bronze Age settlement of Proskinas, situated 2 km from the coast and the Middle Bronze Age to Early Iron Age site of Mitrou, a small tidal islet in the Bay of Atalanti. The quantitative and qualitative study of the many molluscan species showed that shells were gathered for different purposes, i.e. food, purple-dye production, jewelry and tools.&#x0D; There was a special preference in the gathering of Spondylus gaederopus, however, for eating and for tool making. At the site of Proskynas, Spondylus not only forms the main species of the assemblage (316 out of 784 shells), but there is also clear evidence that it was gathered beach-worn to serve as scraping, scaling or percussion implement. The situation is different at the site of Mitrou; there, Spondylus is in quantity the third species in the assemblage (749 out of 6325), but was primarily gathered for food and was only secondarily used as a tool. The paper explores the choronological and spatial data of the two sites, which indicate the differences in Spondylus gaederopus usage. It will also try to pinpoint differences in the perception and use of Spondylus between the Neolithic and Bronze Age and between Central and Northern Greece.",Printed book,R.

2225,FT-59582-12,"In 1930 the award-winning French novelist and critic, Georges Duhamel condemned appetite for consumer goods and entertainment, and criticized commercial broadcasting, illustrating an important dimension of the global history of communications and culture. Well before the early 1930s, when semi-regular U.S. shortwave radio broadcasts began reaching France, concerned French citizens wondered about transatlantic connectivity and the specter of commercial radio. This article concentrates on French print journalism reporting on the changing U.S. broadcast landscape of the 1920s and 1930s. From the specific reportage and editorial commentary of Le Petit Radio (a booster of the French public radio system), three evocative themes emerge: critical reaction to the ""wild West"" of US radio growth, an equivocal response to the celebrated modernism of RCA's Radio City, and claims that radio advertising degenerated culture, and must be limited or eradicated. The ideologically charged treatment of U.S. broadcasting in France that resulted casts fresh light on how ideas associated with ""American radio"" (and America) took hold within communications policy debates and French culture, as proponents of private and public models for national broadcasting competed for advantage in a widening arena of global connection and competition.",,Derek W.

Leading scholars examine the divergences and commonalities in the legal and economic regimes that allowed Britain to project imperium across the globe. They explore the nature of sovereignty and law, governance and regulation, diplomacy, military relations and commerce, shedding new light on the processes of expansion that influenced the making of empire. While acknowledging the distinctions and divergences in imperial endeavours in Asia and the Americas - not least in terms of the size of indigenous populations, technical and cultural differences, and approaches to indigenous polities - this book argues that these differences must be seen in the context of what Britons overseas shared, including constitutional principles, claims of sovereignty, disciplinary regimes and military attitudes.&#x0D; ",Open Access,"Paul Grant-Costa, Elizabeth Mancke",Britian's Oceanic Empire,"Elizabeth Mancke, John G.

2344,HD-50866-09,"Over a hundred and fifty years after the first appearance of Walt Whitman's  Leaves of Grass , Whitman's work inspired a series of pedagogical experiments that transposed his experimental teaching philosophy and his poetry into the era of networked learning through a project entitled ""Looking for Whitman: The Poetry of Place in the Life and Work of Walt Whitman."" Sponsored by two Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants from the United States National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the project brought together classes from four academic institutions in a collaborative digital environment that emphasized place-based learning and progressive educational techniques. The project set forth a new model for aggregated, collaborative and open learning practices that mirrored Whitman's own poetic ideals and that has served as an important example of digital pedagogy for the digital humanities community. Like Whitman's own checkered career as a teacher, however, the project's successes and its failures point towards future developments along related lines. As I discuss the project and describe some of the ways in which others might extend its work, I hope to articulate some of the reasons why the digital humanities, as a field, would benefit from a more direct engagement with issues of teaching and learning than it has exhibited thus far.",open access,Matthew K.

Finally revolution, the political and social upheavals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, challenged established ideas of divine-right monarchies and divinely ordained social hierarchies, and promoted more democratic government, notions of human rights and religious toleration. A new religious climate emerged, in which people were more likely to look to their own feelings and experiences for the basis of their faith.

Through their analyses of the various modes of exchange of material goods and the circulation of symbolic systems of meaning, the contributors to the anthology-historians and literary critics-investigate, for the first time, the two nations' express points of contact and conflict during these historically crucial fifty years.

2725,RA-20210-00,"Holding his dead daughter, old Lear suddenly believes he sees something given to none of this life to behold; ""Look, her lips, / Look there, look there,"" he vainly bids the other players, as Cordelia's soul, heaven bound, issues from her limp body. In making these a dying madman's words, however, Shakespeare invites his audience to consider rather the fact that we see nothing, and thus to reflect upon the gaping void that seems to lie between Christian promises of salvation and the play's depiction of a bleak, inhospitable universe. Thirty years earlier, Montaigne staged this same scene, to much the same effect, in his essay ""Of exercise,"" casting himself not only in the roles of both Lear and Cordelia, but also in that of the duly skeptical spectator. This paper seeks to situate these two ambiguous stagings of the Christian ""death"" in a wider social context of popular anxiety about salvation and native skepticism over the immortality of the soul. It argues that Montaigne purposely evokes a tradition of heterodoxical responses to the problem of death beginning with the second chapter of the Wisdom of Solomon and stretching to Anabaptism. Instead of a Christian afterlife, Montaigne intimates that his spirit will live on not in his resurrected body but in a mummy, ""I expose myself entire: my portrait is a cadaver on which the veins, the muscles, and the tendons appear at a glance (Frame, 274), the mummy, then, of his book, tightly bound in dried pigskin.",open,"Hoffmann, George",Shakespeare et Montaigne: Vers un Nouvel Humanisme,"Jean-Pierre Maguin, Pierre Kapitaniak",,http://www.societefrancaiseshakespeare.org/document.php?id=168,"Fondée en 1975, la Société Française Shakespeare (SFS) est une association loi 1901 et une société scientifique.

I argue that the need for a ""self-made man,"" for a homespun, ""common man"", and especially, the need to believe that the American past was ""stateless"" especially regarding the role of government in the economy, led to the disappearance from scholarship and American memory not only of Lincoln's political economy, but of his entire political party.

In particular I critique Republican Party and libertarian narratives that assume a stateless American past and decry what they then see as a descent into big government.  Libertarians blame the descent on Lincoln while mainstream Republicans look for a way to get Lincoln off the hook.  Both assume a picture of past American political economy that is unsustainable.  Indeed they have the story backward.  Radically liberal anti-state theories arise AFTER the Civil War and did not characterize the antebellum period.  Only occasionally have Democratic politicians sought to enlist Lincoln for their cause while the scholarly left seems largely uninterested.  Political writers and scholars of all persuasions have underestimated the degree to which creating the conditions in which men could achieve economic independence rather than rising wages or material prosperity was the generally accepted goal of political economy in the Lincoln's lifetime.  This goal was largely abandoned on all sides, right ant left, by the 20th century.",,Stewart Winger,A Companion to Abraham Lincoln,Michael Green,,,,Wiley Blackwell,,,"Remember the Whigs II: The Historiography of Lincoln’s Political Economy and the Myth of a Stateless American Past ",2015

As singers whose voices are first recorded in the studio and then ""played back"" on the set to be lip-synched by actors, playback singers have been professional musicians and public celebrities since the 1950s. Their careers are governed by practices of voice cultivation and by modes of performance and public self-presentation, in the studio, on stage, and increasingly in mediatized contexts. Since the 1990s, neoliberal logics of flexibility, entrepreneurship and self-marketing have redefined the role of the playback singer and the way singers conceive of their work in both social and aesthetic terms. These changes have occurred within a broader context in which anxieties about globalization and expanding commodity culture are reflected in debates about the place of women in public.",,Amanda Weidman,"Culture, Theory and Critique",,,,,,,,Neoliberal Logics of Voice: Playback Singing and Public Femaleness in South India,2014
3138,RA-50075-09,"This essay examines the of colonial encounter as a scene of translation, focusing on the degree to which colonial encounter is a scene—an embodied  performance—as much as on the extent to which this encounter concerns translation, linguistic force, and erasure. More specifically, it sketches a New World genealogy of theatricalized colonial encounters, beginning with Prospero and Caliban's encounter in Shakespeare's&#x0D; The Tempest  (1611), and following its permutations in John Dryden and William Davenant's The Enchanted  Island (1667), through Daniel Defoe's scene of encounter between Robinson Crusoe and Friday in Robinson Crusoe (1719), and Richard Sheridan's theatricalized version of the same—Harlequin Friday or Robinson Crusoe&#x0D;  (1781). The essay analyzes each of these texts in relation to a central scene of colonial encounter that, in every case, is also a scene of translation and/or language instruction. It also aims to consider the way in which this genealogy of texts is itself marked by translation—Dryden and Davenant translate Shakespeare; Sheridan translates Defoe. And finally, it focuses in particular on one historical locus of these multiple translations—namely, the performance history of The Tempest and Robinson Crusoe in the theaters of Charleston, S.C. in the 1790s. This performance history, occurring at a time when the theater had enormous cultural currency, underscores the significance of the geographical translation of English texts to American stages and points, as I ultimately want to argue, to the importance of the embodied public—the embodied scene of encounter with its attendant remains—in the creole culture of America.",,Elizabeth Maddock Dillon,Transatlantic Traffic and (Mis)Translations,"Daniel Maudlin, Robin Peel",978-1-61168-42,http://www.upne.com/1611684247.html,,University Press of New England,,,"""Coloniality, Performance, Translation: The Embodied Public Sphere in Early America",2013

Using Tunisia, Morocco, and Iraq during critical periods of state-building following the end of colonial rule, the author considers this question. The purpose of the article is to build on Max Weber by exploring how patrimonialism operates in kin-based social contexts where power on the basis of kinship ties is exerted not only by a central authority but also by leaders of local communities organized along lines of real or fictive kinship—as was the case in the three countries in the period under examination. Suggesting that Weber undertheorized the way in which central authority relates to local collectivities in his analysis of patrimonialism, the author identifies three patterns in the strategies used by central power toward local patrimonial networks: marginalization, integration, and shifts between marginalization and integration. The article argues that central patrimonialism can be accommodated with all three strategies directed toward local patrimonialism.",,Mounira M. Charrad,Patrimonial Power in the Modern World,"Julia P.

3586,RA-50096-10,"This book is about various linguistic aspects and consequences of the effective colonization of Latin America by Portugal and Spain since the dawn of the 16th century. It is about how Portuguese and Spanish (then known only as Castilian) have both been influenced by their contacts with indigenous and other languages in their Iberian colonies, as well as how the indigenous languages in particular have also been affected by the colonial languages. The book provides novel perspectives onto how the European colonists first communicated with the Natives, onto the role played by the ""factors,"" missionaries, Mestizos, and Pardos as interpreters, and onto why one should not assume that jargons or pidgins emerged of necessity out of the initial inter-group contacts. Insights are likewise provided about the gradual ways in which Portuguese and Spanish spread, about how some major indigenous languages (such as Quechua and Tupinamba´) at first benefited from the European colonization and from their adoption by missionaries as lingua francas for proselytizing, as well as about why some Native American languages are being threatened only now or don't appear to be (seriously) endangered yet. Throughout the volume, one has to ask who have been the actual agents and/or drivers of the changes that have affected both indigenous and initially exogenous languages, positively or negatively, in Latin America. And what are the relevant ecological factors that have triggered or simply borne on these evolutions? The subject of African substrate influence is also dealt with, alongside that of Italian adstrate influence on Argentine Spanish. (abstract is on complete book)",,M.

3632,RZ-50466-05,"In the archaeology of colonial and antebellum African America one of the most evocative artifact classes is low-fired earthenware.  The blanket term usually applied to this category –colonoware – has entered the archaeological vocabulary rather uncritically despite its deeply contested meaning.  In this chapter we examine how colonoware has been used as a category in Louisiana archaeology; consider the ways in which life in the French/Spanish colony – different in many ways from life in the English colonies – might effect the development and use of low-fired earthenwares; and consider  methods one might use to explore inter and intra-regional diversity in this ceramic technology. When comparing contact period and early colonial Native American pottery assemblages with late colonial to early American period Euro-African pottery assemblages it is apparent that low-fired earthenwares go from being the only available ceramic in northwest Louisiana in the mid 1600s to a seemingly obsolete ware by about 1830. Simultaneously, as Euro-American wares came to dominate the vessels being used at plantations, urban homes, and Native American villages, the amount of decorated low-fired earthenwares became increasingly sparse.  In terms of makers, there are strong correspondences between the Coincoin colonowares and known Native American decorated types of the historic period, particularly as they relate to the Caddo and possibly the Apalachee, Choctaw, Natchez, and Coushatta, but this does not rule out the possibility of African production. Additional technical analyses, perhaps focused on untempered wares, may clarify this issue.&#x0D; ",,"David W. Morgan, Kevin C.

While the process of representing the Partition experience through words and images began in the late 1940s, it is only in the last few decades that literary critics and film scholars have begun to analyse the work. The emerging critical scholarship on the Partition and its aftermath has deepened our understanding of the relationship between historical trauma, collective memory, and cultural processes, and this book provides critical readings of literary and cinematic texts on the impact of the Partition both in the Punjab and in Bengal. The collection assembles studies on Anglophone writings with those on the largely unexplored vernacular works, and those which have rarely found a place in discussions on the Partition. It looks at representations of women's experiences of gendered violence in the Partition riots, and how literary texts have filled in the lack of the 'human dimension' in Partition histories. The book goes on to highlight how the memory of the Partition is preserved, and how the creative arts' relation to public memory and its place within the public sphere has changed through time. Collectively, the essays present a nuanced understanding of how the experience of violence, displacement, and trauma shaped postcolonial societies and subjectivities in the Indian subcontinent.

Mackaye's approach to actor training drew on the speculative&#x0D; philosophy of his teacher, François Delsarte. In his unfinished essay ""Trichotomic""&#x0D; (probably drafted in early 1888), Peirce noted with interest Mackaye's triadic&#x0D; account of the actor's task, which involves the use of three capacities (sensation,&#x0D; perception, and affection) to represent the corresponding categories as they&#x0D; are experienced in human life. Peirce did not take up Mackaye's triads or the&#x0D; speculative philosophy behind them.

4000,HD-51581-12,"Drawing especially on the everyday details about the circulation of broadside ballads as narrated in Samuel Pepys's diary, 1660–1669, this essay explores the makings of ballad publics in seventeenth-century England. By ‘publics' I refer to unofficial and free forms of association based on a shared, if sometimes only roughly articulated agenda, before the rise around 1700 of what has been come to be known as the Habermasian ‘public sphere'. As Leslie P. Cormack summarizes, we must think of pre-Habermasian publics not along his model of a strictly unified (male) middle class engaged in political critique of its aristocracy but, in a less constrained way: as ‘a loose collection of people, not all of whom have personal knowledge of one another, connected by a common interest in a particular subject and with some social or political goal in mind'. By virtue of their being publics, not the public, I would add, such informal assemblages are multiple and always in the making (meaning that they can emerge and die out in an organic way). They are also capable of being stronger or weaker depending on the particular persons or circumstances or time periods involved. With this liberal definition in mind, my essay will track the making of multiple seventeenth-century English ballad publics that emerge out a shared cultural understanding across classes of the nature and function of broadside ballads. It concludes with the idea that a ballad public – or pluralistically conceived, ballad publics – consists of encircling spheres wherein strength lies closest to the center but can also arise and decrease anywhere, in any encircling sphere, on the spur of the moment.",,Patricia Fumerton,"Identities, Intertextuality and Performance in Song Culture (c. 1500 – c. 1800)",,,,,Brill,,,Samuel Pepys and  the Making of Ballad Publics,2014

4251,RA-50020-04,"Soon after the restoration of the Stuart Monarchy in 1660, English forces seized New Netherland from the Dutch, and carved it into a series of sovereign deputy sub-enterprises (colonies) on the ""Proprietary"" colonial model.  As the Stuart regime wobbled and then toppled in the 1680s, its policy-makers reconsidered the strategy of fragmenting the old Dutch hearth, which they were having great difficulty ""Anglicizing."" But rather than reassembling sovereign structures across a jumble of new colonies, they turned to a different model of regional cohesion, associated with the intervention of William Penn after 1681, which focused on creating and fostering informal and often private networks of interest groups, proprietary, imperial, and private. These webs of interest comprised a trans-Atlantic extension of Penn's almost uncanny ability in England itself to move comfortably between communities of dissent and state suppression; between the established Anglican and his own nearly outlawed Quaker church; and, at a formal political level, between the emergent and antagonistic ""Whig""and ""Tory"" factions of the Parliamentary system.  Penn's physical health and fiscal strength faded rapidly after 1700, but the networks he had created either persevered or threw off practices, habits, and customs that became ""ligaments"" of a new regional order.",,Wayne Bodle,Converging Worlds: Communities and Cultures in Colonial America,Louise A.

It is, for one, a historical sense of ancestry embodied in two centuries of New England ministers with high-minded ethics – and the aunt who invoked them, Mary Moody Emerson. It is also fraternal bonding forged in bereavement, since brothers Edward, Charles, and Bulkeley suffered some form of the family's ""constitutional calamity"": ambition, tuberculosis, and mental instability (JMN 3:137). The death in 1831 of first wife, Ellen Louisa Tucker, followed in succession in 1836 and 1842 by the deaths of brother Charles and Waldo, cherished son from a second marriage, devastated Emerson.

She traces the emergence of urban features&#x0D; during the Predynastic Period up to the disintegration of the powerful Middle Kingdom&#x0D; state (ca. 3500–1650 BCE). This book offers a synthesis of the archaeological data that&#x0D; sheds light on the different facets of urbanism in ancient Egypt. Drawing on evidence&#x0D; from recent excavations as well as a vast body of archaeological data, the volume explores&#x0D; the changing settlement patterns by contrasting periods of strong political control against&#x0D; those of decentralization. It also discusses households and the layout of domestic architecture, which are key elements for understanding how society functioned and evolved&#x0D; over time.

4758,FN-50112-13,"Informal conversation is a practice found among speakers of every language in every culture on Earth. Or is it? Is conversation just one ofmany culturally variable speech genres, or is it the informal baseline on which all other genres are built? Can the same type of basic turn-taking system be observed in all languages, or does it vary analogously to the ways that grammatical systems do? Are conversational actions such as ""asking questions"" or ""giving directives"" present in every culture, or are these culture-specific categories based on English, meaning that other cultures have their own distinct categories? These questions are central not only to understanding language usage, but also to conceptualizing human sociality more generally. Larger social realities are built up from thousands and thousands of small-scale interactions, so a social scientist's need to understand these tiny moments is a bit like a physicist's need to understand subatomic particles. Given its fundamental nature, it is surprising that conversational interaction has, with a few notable exceptions, mainly been treated peripherally to other domains in linguistic anthropology. Reasons for this are complex, involving both disciplinary histories as well as changing technological constraints on the collection of corpora of audio/video data in many different linguistic and cultural contexts. This history is discussed in more detail below, but initially it is worth revisiting the origins of the modern-day study of talk in interaction with respect to our present questions about conversational practices across cultures.",,Simeon Floyd,Cambridge handbook of linguistic anthropology,,,http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1760003:6/component/escidoc:2071751/Dingemanse Floyd Conversation 2014.pdf,,Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,,,Conversation Across Cultures,2014

Aldrich, Purdue University   NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) protests are often criticized as parochial and short-lived, generating no lasting influence on broader processes related to environmental politics. This volume offers a different perspective. Drawing on cases from around the globe, it demonstrates that NIMBY protests, although always arising from a local concern in a particular community, often result in broader political, social, and technological change. Chapters include cases from Europe, North America, and Asia, engaging with the full political spectrum from established democracies to non-democratic countries. Regardless of political setting, NIMBY movements can have a positive and proactive role in generating innovative solutions to local as well as transnational environmental issues. Furthermore, those solutions are now serving as models for communities and countries around the world.

4855,FO-50251-15,"Nowhere is the connection between society and the environment more evident and potentially more harmful for the future of the world than in Asia. In recent decades, rapid development of Asian countries with very large populations has led to an unprecedented increase in environmental problems such as air and water pollution, solid and hazardous wastes, deforestation, depletion of natural resources and extinction of native species.   This handbook provides a comprehensive survey of the cultural, social and policy contexts of environmental change across East Asia. The team of international experts critically examine a wide range of environmental problems related to energy, climate change, air, land, water, fisheries, forests and wildlife.  The editors conclude that, with nearly half of the human population of the planet, and several rapidly growing economies, most notably China, Asian societies will determine much of the future of human impacts on the regional and global environments. As climate change-related threats to society increase, the book strongly argues for increased environmental consciousness and action in Asian societies. This handbook is a very valuable companion for students, scholars, policy makers and researchers working on environmental issues in Asia.

In order to more fully explore the innovations and intercultural context underlying the reshaping of the environment in Archaic Ionia, the chapter focuses on the all-marble, truly Ionic Artemision at Ephesos and the Tunnel of Eupalinos at Samos. The most complete evidence for such engineering pertains to the truly gigantic Kroisos Temple at Ephesos. As in Archaic Ionian temple architecture, the tunnel of Eupalinos is perhaps best understood against the larger context of fluid intercultural knowledge and traditions made possible by the tensions and shared achievements of the recently dissolved Neo-Assyrian world, but created at a larger scale with great skill and innovation",print book,John Senseney,A Companion to Greek Architecture,Margaret Miles,978-1-4443-359,DOI: 10.1002/9781118327586,Wiley-Blackwell access,Wiley Blackwell,,,The Greek East:  Temples and Engineering,2016
5193,RA-50078-09,"Along with Ionian abstract thinkers like Anaximander in the sixth century BCE, Archaic architects were the earliest Greek prose writers. Whereas Anaximander and others wrote about the nature of the universe, architects like Theodoros, Chersiphron, and Metagenes wrote about their discoveries and successes in the sphere of building construction. In the theory of Hellenistic architects focused on questions of design, there developed an interest in scale, which enabled the design of buildings through graphic means for the envisioning of buildings from the abstract, disembodied aerial view of ground plans. With extensive reference to the Didymaion, this chapter explores scale planning in Hellenistic architectural theory as reflected in Vitruvius. The theoretical processes and principles scale design developed first in traditional methods of construction that preceded common application of reduced scale in the art of building, which was unlikely to have taken place prior to Hermogenes in the later third century BCE.",on-line and print book,John Senseney,A Companion to Greek Architecture,Margaret Miles,978-1-4443-359,DOI: 10.1002/9781118327586,book content access,Wiley Blackwell,,,"Scale, Architects, and Architectural Theory",2016

Invoking scholarship on shared and collective memories and citing both the discovery of a Bronze Age kingdom in the basin of the Gygaean Lake (modern Marmara Golu) and the sacred significance of the area deriving from the cyclic fluctuation of its water bodies, we suggest Lydian kings selected Bin Tepe for burial to associate themselves with and co-opt local memories of heroes and sacred meanings.  Bin Tepe is thus considered from the perspective of the significance of its natural and conceptual landscapes.

Modern scholarship replicates the Ottoman use of the term and regards virtually all works with narratives of events as 'history;' little distinction is made between the various types of Ottoman historical writing.  Yet, from a modern perspective used to modern definitions and taxonomies within the discipline of history, seeing the label applied to a variety of Ottoman historical productions is confusing, both with regard to the topics, and to the time period that they cover.  To the modern mind, pamphlets and monographs justifying a political position, glorifying campaigns, eulogizing statesmen, or investigating controversial current events would be regarded as reportage, propaganda, political analysis, or some combination thereof.

Consequently, he has been memorialized in the Ukraine as a God-given nation builder, cut in the model of George Washington. But in this campaign, the massacre of thousands of Jews perceived as Polish intermediaries was the collateral damage, and in order to secure the tentative independence, Khmelnytsky signed a treaty with Moscow, ultimately ceding the territory to the Russian tsar. So, was he a liberator or a villain? This volume examines drastically different narratives, from Ukrainian, Jewish, Russian, and Polish literature, that have sought to animate, deify, and vilify the seventeenth-century Cossack.

The contributors aim both to honor Pearsall's work in the field he established and to introduce the complexities of interdisciplinary manuscript studies to students already familiar with medieval literature.  The contributors explore a range of issues, from the study of medieval literary manuscripts to the history of medieval books, libraries, literacy, censorship, and the social classes who used the books and manuscripts—nobles, children, schoolmasters, priests, merchants, and more. In addressing reading practices, essays provide a wealth of information on marginal commentaries, images and interpretive methods, international transmission, and early print and editorial methods.",,Kathryn Kerby-Fulton,New Directions in Medieval Manuscript Studies and Reading Practices: Essays in Honour of Derek Pearsall,"Kathryn Kerby-Fulton, John Thompson, Sarah Baechle",,,,University of Notre Dame Press,,,"Confronting the Scribe- Poet Binary: The Case of the Z Text of Piers Plowman and the Evidence of London Reading Circles.""",2014
9691,FA-56438-12,"This collaborative literary history of Europe, the first yet attempted, unfolds through ten sequences of places linked by trade, travel, topography, language, pilgrimage, alliance, disease, and artistic exchange. The period covered, 1348-1418, provides deep context for understanding current developments in Europe, particularly as initiated by the destruction and disasters of World War II. We begin with the greatest of all European catastrophes: the 1348 bubonic plague, which killed one person in three. Literary cultures helped speed recovery from this unprecedented ""ground zero"" experience, providing solace, distraction, and new ideals to live by. Questions of where Europe begins and ends, then as now, and disputes over whom truly ""belongs"" on European soil are explored, if not solved, through writing.   A war that would last for a century convulsed much of western Europe. Divisions between Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christianities endured, and in 1378 the West divided again between popes of Avignon and Rome. Arabic literary cultures linked Fes and Granada to Jerusalem and Damascus; Persian and Turkish writings began to flourish south and west of Constantinople; Jewish intellectuals treasured Arabic texts as well as Hebrew writings; Armenian colophons proved unique. From 1414-18 western nations gathered to heal their papal schism while also exchanging literary, humanist, and musical ideas; visitors from the East hoped for commitment to wider European peace. Freed from nation state historiography, as bequeathed by the nineteenth century, these 82 chapters freshly assess the free movement of European literature in all its variety, local peculiarity, and regenerative power.",,Kathryn Kerby-Fulton,Regeneration: a Literary History of Europe: 1348-1418,,,,,Oxford University Press,,,Oxford,2015

The chief claims are that (i) the concept character does, indeed, have explanatory and ethical significance, and (ii) prevailing conditions of long-term incarceration in the U.S. and U.K. often harm and worsen prisoners through their impact on dispositions constitutive of character. While a liberal polity should not require individuals to acquire virtues, neither should it cause them to have vices (or worsen their vices) in known and regular ways. The ways that prison conditions have that result are considered, along with the respects in which this disables ex-prisoners for reentering society.

This chapter sheds light on this area by examining the role Daoist classic Zhuangzi played in the development of Japanese haikai—the matrix of modern haiku—during the latter half of the seventeenth century. &#x0D; &#x0D; When haikai became a popular genre of linked verse in the seventeenth century, haikai poets faced paradoxical demands. On the one hand, they had to break the conventions of the classical linked verse in order to reach a popular audience, on the other hand, they needed codified poetic signifiers and intertextual structures from the classical tradition to elevate haikai's vernacular language to poetic art. This chapter locates haikai's encounter with the Zhuangzi in the intersection of the deconstructing and reconstructing of the canonical traction. It provides a hermeneutic reading of the intertextual relations between haikai compositions and the Daoist texts, as well as an in-depth analyses of key terms that have been instrumental in reconstructing haikai's poetic essence. Through examining the works of Japan's greatest haikai poet Matsuo Basho (1664-1694), it shows how the Zhuangzi helped turn the parodic and vernacular haikai into a high art.",Book in print,Peipei Qiu,Daoism in Japan: Chinese Traditions and Their Influence on Japanese Religious Culture,Jeffrey L.

This paper argues that a relational theory provides a pragmatic solution that accounts for some disagreements as involving inconsistent preferences rather than beliefs.  This is shown to be superior to the semantic solution offered by expressivists like Allan Gibbard, as it accounts for a wider range of disagreements, explains a puzzling asymmetry, and avoids the expressivist's problem with negation.  This pragmatic account extends to fundamental disagreements involving preferences for different ends.

Over the course of his career, Alemán performed multiple black identities, responding creatively to his audiences' varied racial expectations. In the Parisian nightclubs of the 1930s, being black gave him a certain cachet.  Similarly, once he returned to Buenos Aires in 1940, his racial identity strengthened his claim to being Argentina's most authentic jazz musician. Yet as a black jazz musician, he challenged ideas about Argentine national identity in ways that ultimately limited his career horizons. Alemán's commercial success in Argentina during the 1940s and 1950s problematizes simplistic accounts of Argentine racism.

I focus on the experience of influential individuals: officials who promoted the policy that led to the ""primitive"" territory's continued colonization following World War II.  These officials began their careers leading expeditions into the territory's interior in the 1930s.  In doing so, they found themselves unsettled by their dependence on local people and their technologies, along with the assemblage of equipment, supplies, and personnel that made up what I have called the ""trekking machine.""  Daily life on these journeys blurred the boundaries between colonizers and colonized, not to mention New Guinea's erstwhile rulers and their tools.   The technological performances I explore in this paper intervene to redraw a sharp line.  By demonstrating the power of instruments ranging from gramophones to rifles to airplanes, Dutch officials sought to augment and define their own agency, which they associated with the modern world.  These demonstrations went hand in hand with encounters in which they sought to put Papuan technologies on display – and display Papuans as both caught in the past and uncannily capable of progress, albeit only with the tutelage of benevolent Dutch masters.  Predictably, these demonstrations often backfired.

One of the principal strategies adopted by Russell, Rudolf Carnap, Willard Van Orman Quine and like-minded philosophers was to use logic to throw out the old furniture and replace it with new furniture of their liking. The full implications of those new theories about the ultimate structure of reality have yet to be drawn because, for many reasons, many avenues of research have yet to be pursued.

I endeavor to outline Husserl's prescription for finding clarity with respect to the central traits of reality. In particular, I seek to disinter the parts and members of the categorial skeleton designed by Husserl to uphold knowledge in a way that stands in sharp contrast to the logical point of view that has underpropped phenomenology's rival school of thought, analytic philosophy, of which Quine was one of the foremost exponents.",Book,Claire Ortiz Hill,"Mereologies, Ontologies, and Facets: The Categorical Structure of Reality",Paul Hackett,Forthcoming,,Forthcoming,Lexington Books,,,"""Limning the True and Ultimate Structure of Reality""",2017

I study ways in which Husserl and Cantor might be said to have been alike, while pointing to dissimilarities between them. In particular, I discuss how their ideas overlapped and crisscrossed with regard to mathematics and philosophy, Platonic idealism, abstraction, empiricism, psychologism, actual consciousness and pure logic, Frege's reviews of their works, metaphysics and mysticism, sets, arithmetization, strange and imaginary numbers and manifolds.

10457,FN-50009-06,"Rivero (1994) makes a distinction between true imperatives (imperatives with unique morphology) and surrogate imperatives (imperatives that make use of the morphology of other moods or features). For negative commands, some languages use true imperative with negation and others use surrogate imperatives. Zejlstra (2004) attempts to capture this phenomenon in an interesting generalization, namely, that only languages in which the negative is X° impose a ban on true negative imperative. This paper reviews this generalization in the light of data from Tanzanian Bantu languages of Kikisi, Kindendeule, Chingoni, and Kimatuumbi, all of which have postverbal negative clitic and use surrogate negative. The particles are ndali (Kikisi), yee (Kindendeule), hee (Chingoni) and lí (Kimatuumbi). The data show that the negative particles exhibit distributional features of adverbs. This paper argues that the post-verbal position of the particle is a result of movement of the verb to a position higher than the adjunction position of the negative. As an adverb, it does not prevent the verb from moving across. This accounts for why in spite of being in post-verbal position, it takes scope over the preceding predicate. The languages in this study do not have a true negative imperative. The verb morphology used for imperative cannot combine with negation to express a negative command. Instead, a negative command is expressed by the prohibitive      –somu (Kikisi), -koto (Kindendeule and Chingoni)  ‘stop' and –kotoka  (Kimatuumbi) ‘do not do' together with an infinitive form of the main verb. Kindendeule also allows an infinitive verb followed by the negative particle yee. The paper argues that the ban on negative imperative is due to the adjunction occurring too low to have scope over the illocutionary force in ForceP.",Open,Deo Ngonyani,Selected Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Conference on African Linguistics: Linguistic Interfaces in African Languages,?lanik? ?la Orie and Karen W.

In ""Realism, Fantasy and the Gendered Trope of Colonial Relations in Galdós's Fiction,"" Mary Coffey argues that in this series, written from 1875 to 1879, Galdós attempts to mitigate the trauma of the nation's imperial decline through the creation of a new metropolitan foundational fiction that allegorizes an acceptance of diminished status. Yet the literary realism employed with success early in his career proves inadequate for the subject matter of post-1898 metropolitan/colonial relations, and in 1909, when Galdós writes El caballero encantado, he turns to the crafting of a cuento inverosímil for his fantastic portrait of imperial reconciliation. Notably, in both the family romance of his early fiction and the dreamlike fantasy of his later work, Galdós's treatment of Spanish colonialism constitutes varying forms of metropolitan wish fulfillment. At the core of his allegorical representations at both points in his career is the traditional gendered trope of metropolis and colony.

Bishops thus often championed the cults of individuals, whom popes or papal agents considered suspect or unworthy of veneration, often incurring a reprimand in return.

10882,EH-50424-14,"The nineteenth century - the Era of the Interior - witnessed the steady displacement of art from the ceilings,  walls, and floors of aristocratic and religious interiors to the everyday spaces of bourgeois households, subject to their own enhanced ornamentation. Following the 1863 Salon des refuses, the French State began to channel mediocre painters into the decorative arts. England, too, launched an extensive reform of the decorative arts, resulting in more and more artists engaged in the production and design of complete interiors.  America soon followed. Present art historical scholarship - still indebted to a modernist discourse that sees cultural progress to be synonymous with the removal of ornament from both utilitarian objects and architectural spaces - has not yet acknowledged the importance of the decorative arts in the myriad interior spaces of the 1800s. Nor has mainstream art history reckoned with the importance of the interior in nineteenth-century life and thought. Aimed at an interdisciplinary audience, including art and design historians, historians of the modern interior, interior designers, visual culture theorists, and scholars of nineteenth-century material culture, this collection of essays studies the modern interior in new ways. The  volume addresses the double nature of the modern interior as both space and image, blurring the boundaries between arts and crafts, decoration and high art, two-dimensional and three-dimensional design, trompe-l'oeil effects and spatial practices.

In the 1950s, San Juan and Havana were two of the most popular international destinations for Americans, and the new hotels built in these cities were significant displays of modern architecture and design, impressing tourists and locals alike. Design and tourism converged in these hotels to create cultural contact zones that shaped American tourists' and the local populations' attitudes about cultural identity and international and local politics.&#x0D; &#x0D; Considering both U.S. and insular sources, this essay underscores how hotel design, and the discourses surrounding it, were often adopted and manipulated by various agents, including local governments, private operators, guests, and the local population, to promote or contest contemporaneous debates surrounding issues of national identity, U.S.-insular relations, and the politics of tourism. These debates often hinged on notions of the modern and modernization, the historic or traditional, and concepts of the tropics. The Caribe Hilton demonstrates the Puerto Rican government's bold move to finance a strikingly modern hotel, which served as a symbol of the island's modernization program and promoted the use of avant-garde modernism in hotel design around the world. The Havana Riviera showcased the cosmopolitan nature of Havana in the 1950s, in which design represented the way in which Cuban culture carefully blended modernity and tradition. Concluding with a brief examination of the contemporary status of these hotels, this essay points to the ways the histories of these designs are shaped over time according to changing attitudes revolving around the topics of politics, international relations, tourism, and national identity.",,Erica Morawski,"The Politics of Furniture: Identity, Diplomacy and Persuasion in Postwar Interiors","Cammy McAtee, Fredie Floré",,,,Routledge,,,"""Modernism on Vacation: The Politics of Hotel Furniture in the Spanish Caribbean""",2016

In particular, the Meteorologica's explanations depend on Aristotle's view that there are two elemental cycles, an earth–?re cycle and an air–water cycle, which Aristotle ultimately explains in terms of teleological processes outside of the Meteorologica. Scharle argues that Aristotle's procedure in explaining meteorology is just what one would expect from Parts of Animals i.1 and his practice in the biological works:he is examining the necessary byproducts of teleological processes. The difference between biological and meteorological cases, she argues, is that in biology the organism can make use of necessary by-products to further the organism's ends. By contrast, there is no way for the elements to make use of necessary by-products to further their ends because they are entirely passive and have no parts.",,Margaret Scharle,Theory and Practice in Aristotle's Natural Science,David Ebrey,110705513X,http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/classical-philosophy/theory-and-practice-aristotles-natural-science?format=HB,,Cambridge University Press,,,The Place of the Meteorologica in Aristotle’s Natural Science,2015

Khoury's 1994 novel Majma‘ al-Asrar (The collection of secrets) is at once an homage to García Márquez's narrative techniques and a corrective commentary on the forms of Orientalism, or discursive violence, that linger in Crónica.  In Majma‘ al-Asrar, Khoury, while commenting on these Orientalist tensions, also looks beyond them to use Crónica to attempt to understand violence and the narrative act in South Atlantic contexts.

Davidson is commonly taken to defend token identity—token mental events are identical with token physical events—but type diversity—mental types ‘supervene on', but are not reducible to or identical with physical types, where types are understood as properties. Mental events are physical events, but one and the same event can have a physical property and, by virtue of having this property, have a mental property as well. There are two salient difficulties with this account. (1) It gives rise to the problem of ‘causal relevance': granted that a mental event can cause a physical event, could it do so by virtue of being mental, by virtue of its possession of a mental property?

She argues that nationalism, a modern political ideology embraced by the Balkan bourgeoisie in its secular form, had to be recast in a new, religious language that was more accessible to the non-national peasants in order to find the mass support it needed to prevail as the principle of political legitimacy.  She also explains how political violence became the ultimate catalyst in this process that welded free-floating allegiances into hard and immutable boundaries.  She introduces a new paradigm of analysis that demonstrates how it was not nationalism that led to conflict in the diversely populated Macedonian lands, but in fact elite-generated violence triggered nationalism as conflict forced people to ambivalently take sides.",hardback book,Ipek Yosmaoglu,"Beyond Mosque, Church, and State: Alternative Narratives of the Nation in the Balkans","Yana Hashamova, Theodora Dragostinova",97896338613,http://ceupress.com/books/html/Beyond Mosque church State.htm,Publisher's page,Central European University Press,,,From Exorcism to Historicism:  The Legacy of Empire   and the Pains of Nation-Making in the Balkans,2016

A local Muslim scholarly tradition, however, did not immediately emerge in these lands following the establishment of Muslim political control.  Atcil seeks to uncover the origins of a self-perpetuating scholarly system in the lands of Rum during the fifteenth century, examining the conditions, which might have influenced scholars' decision to move around, in the lands of Rum and other Muslim lands during the fifteenth century.  He suggests that the tempo at which scholars moved to the lands of Rum probably remained consistent and perhaps even increased from the fourteenth to the fifteenth century, whereas during the fifteenth century the scholarly scene began to change and move in the direction of being self-sufficient. He points to the region's relative political stability, the concurrent presence of a critical number of high-level scholars, and the establishment of a growing number of well-funded madrasas of royal prestige as factors that made it possible for scholars to receive an advanced education within the lands of Rum.",hardback book,Abdurrahman Atcil,Islamic Literature and Intellectual Life in Fourteenth- and Fifteenth-Century Anatolia,"Sara Nur Yildiz, A.

12121,RA-50108-12,"How can burial furnishings help us to approach the meanings of banqueting imagery in funerary art or understand the place of banqueting in funerary ideologies? Should tombs furnished with klinai or replicas of banquet couches be understood as physical, three-dimensional representations of banqueting, meant to equip the dead for an eternal ‘Totenmahl'? Or do funeral couches mark their occupants as members of the elite class that enjoyed banqueting and/or luxury furniture while alive? These questions are not so easily answered, because klinai in the ancient Greek world were multi-functional furnishings, used for sleeping and resting as well as for dining and revelry, and because burial assemblages are constructed representations, much like tomb paintings or reliefs . This paper will summarize evidence for burial klinai in Greece and Anatolia in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, with particular focus on tombs with additional signifiers of banqueting (tables, drinking vessels, musical instruments, etc.) or with related banqueting imagery (such as the Karaburun tumulus in northern Lycia). Parameters for interpreting funerary klinai as indicators of a ‘Totenmahl' concept will be proposed, and relevant ethnographic evidence will also be considered. It will be argued that, far from providing ‘hard evidence' to guide our interpretations of contemporary funerary images, burial assemblages reflect the same processes of ideological construction that lie behind two-dimensional representations and thus are subject to the same questions of interpretation. Nevertheless, consideration of burial furniture enriches the study of the ‘funerary banquet' and, when seen alongside contemporary images, underlines the importance of this concept—however defined—in certain eras and regions.",book,Elizabeth Baughan,"Dining and Death:  Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the 'Funerary Banquet' in Ancient Art, Burial and Belief","C.

12124,RA-50078-09,"In the early modern era, European imaginaries of the plague associated the disease's geographic origin with areas ruled by the Ottoman Empire. This particular imagined plague-scape was nurtured by a constant supply of plague news that came from eastern Mediterranean port cities and the common tropes of the European travel literature about the indifference of the Muslims inhabiting that land, their fatalism, and their failure to understand contagion. Taken as a whole, the early modern European plague episteme was, to a large extent, shaped by observations of or accounts about the Ottoman experience of plague. Especially after the plague (and historical memories of it) had started to recede from western Europe in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and with the Enlightenment, it was this set of knowledge, beliefs, and ideas that helped to formulate the origins, foci (foyers de peste), historicity, and directionality of the ""Oriental plague."" &#x0D; This plague paradigm, imbued with unmistakable overtones of epidemiological Orientalism, has had lasting ramifications for the student of the post-Black Death Mediterranean, which is often imagined in epidemiological binaries. In fact, it is fascinating to see how much of that epidemiological imagination has found its way into modern scientific and historical thinking about the plague in time and space. With a conviction that we can no longer afford to keep a Eurocentric vision of this epidemiological past, Varlik revisits some aspects of the epidemiological imaginaries of the Orient.

12166,RA-50105-11,"Volume one of The Oxford History of Anglicanism examines a period when the nature of ""Anglicanism"" was still heavily contested. Rather than merely tracing the emergence of trends that we associate with later Anglicanism, the contributors instead discuss the fluid and contested nature of the Church of England's religious identity in these years, and the different claims to what should count as ""Anglican"" orthodoxy. After the introduction and narrative chapters explain the historical background, individual chapters then analyze different understandings of the early church and church history; variant readings of the meaning of the royal supremacy, the role of bishops and canon law, and cathedrals; the very diverse experiences of religion in parishes, styles of worship and piety, church decoration, and Bible usage; and the competing claims to ""Anglican"" orthodoxy of puritanism, ""avant-garde conformity"" and Laudianism. Also analyzed are arguments over the Church of England's confessional identity and its links with the foreign Reformed Churches, and the alternative models provided by English Protestant activities in Ireland, Scotland and North America. The reforms of the 1640s and 1650s are included in their own right, and the volume concludes that the shape of the Restoration that emerged was far from inevitable, or expressive of a settled ""Anglican"" identity.",,Lori Anne Ferrell,"Reformation and Identity: The Early Struggle for Anglicanism, c. 1520-1661",Anthony Milton,978019963973,,,Oxford University Press,,,Scripture,2016

12221,FA-233427-16,"The serial sketch form—fragmented, contingent, yet linear—that Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and Wilson J. Wilson honed in the Anglo-African Magazine between 1859 and 1860 was integral to representing the experience of being on the verge, of looking forward not only to the immediacy of the next installment, but also to the ""future that is before us.""  Harper's ""Fancy Sketches"" and ""Triumph of Freedom—A Dream"" register this mix of a deep hemispheric time and entanglement through readings of a seventeenth century Brazilian maroon nation and dream sequences that both review ongoing events like John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry and set these events in the timeless space of myth. Harper and Wilson are also concerned with history as a material processes, which results in narrators whose textual encounters reveal a sense of time as an interlocking of pasts, presents, and futures. Wilson explicitly links temporality to form and genre, representing what John Ernest has usefully framed in terms of ""chaotic time and space.""  And as the quote in my title suggests, these acts of reading—to read or to have read?—one's destiny suggests that perhaps the answer isn't as important as the awareness the question raises about the intertwining relationship between temporality and form and how pre-Civil War African American literature on the verge represents and makes use of that relationship.",Book,Derrick R.

12285,RA-50128-13,"This collaborative literary history of Europe, the first yet attempted, unfolds through ten sequences of places linked by trade, travel, topography, language, pilgrimage, alliance, disease, and artistic exchange. The period covered, 1348-1418, provides deep context for understanding current developments in Europe, particularly as initiated by the destruction and disasters of World War II. We begin with the greatest of all European catastrophes: the 1348 bubonic plague, which killed one person in three. Literary cultures helped speed recovery from this unprecedented ""ground zero"" experience, providing solace, distraction, and new ideals to live by. Questions of where Europe begins and ends, then as now, and disputes over whom truly ""belongs"" on European soil are explored, if not solved, through writing. &#x0D; &#x0D; A war that would last for a century convulsed much of western Europe. Divisions between Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christianities endured, and in 1378 the West divided again between popes of Avignon and Rome. Arabic literary cultures linked Fes and Granada to Jerusalem and Damascus; Persian and Turkish writings began to flourish south and west of Constantinople; Jewish intellectuals treasured Arabic texts as well as Hebrew writings; Armenian colophons proved unique. From 1414-18 western nations gathered to heal their papal schism while also exchanging literary, humanist, and musical ideas; visitors from the East hoped for commitment to wider European peace. Freed from nation state historiography, as bequeathed by the nineteenth century, these 82 chapters freshly assess the free movement of European literature in all its variety, local peculiarity, and regenerative power.",,"Gail McMurray Gibson, Theresa Coletti","A Literary History, 1348-1418: Volume I",David Wallace,9780198735359,,,Oxford University Press,,,"Lynn, Walsingham, Norwich",2016

12328,RA-50004-03,"Thomas Middleton (1580-1627) - 'our other Shakespeare' - is the only other Renaissance playwright who created lasting masterpieces of both comedy and tragedy; he also wrote the greatest box-office hit of early modern London (the unique history play A Game at Chess ). His range extends beyond these traditional genres to tragicomedies, masques, pageants, pamphlets, epigrams, and Biblical and political commentaries, written alone or in collaboration with Shakespeare, Webster, Dekker, Ford, Heywood, Rowley, and others. Compared by critics to Aristophanes and Ibsen, Racine and Joe Orton, he has influenced writers as diverse as Aphra Behn and T. S. Eliot. Though repeatedly censored in his own time, he has since come to be particularly admired for his representations of the intertwined pursuits of sex, money, power, and God.&#x0D; &#x0D; The Collected Works brings together for the first time in a single volume all the works currently attributed to Middleton. It is the first edition of Middleton's works since 1886. The texts are printed in modern spelling and punctuation, with critical introductions and foot-of-the-page commentaries; they are arranged in chronological order, with a special section of Juvenilia. The volume is introduced by essays on Middleton's life and reputation, on early modern London, and on the varied theatres of the English Renaissance. Extensively illustrated, it incorporates much new information on Middleton's life, canon, texts, and contexts.

Elements of the queen's popular biography - her European identity and devout Catholic faith - are only a part of the backdrop against which Henrietta Maria is re-considered. Drawing on the expertise of an international group of scholars from different disciplines, these essays explore and shed new light on the Queen's various roles: a patron of performing and visual arts with taste and influence comparable to her husband's, her salient political position between the French and English courts, and her political sentiments at the outbreak of the English Civil War. Through cutting-edge archival research that includes investigations into household accounts and personal correspondence, this collection ultimately presents a new assessment of female power and influence at the early modern court. What becomes strikingly evident is that Henrietta Maria had a distinct and profound influence on material and political culture that deserves the attention of art history, literature, theatre, and musicology scholars.",,Malcolm Smuts,"Henrietta Maria: Piety, Politics and Patronage (Women and Gender in the Early Modern World)",Erin Griffey,978-0754664208,,,Ashgate,,,"Religion, European Politics and Henrietta Maria's Circle",2008

The essays force us to think beyond the simplistic dichotomy between royalist 'absolutists' and 'constitutionalists' and suggest instead that allegiances were much more fluid and contingent than has hitherto been recognized.

This is neither the time nor the place to attempt an overview of, or even an introduction to, the Renaissance period's own archives: much more work — by a team of scholars — would be needed to survey the political, architectural, and intellectual developments that led to the creation of new documentary collections in Renaissance homes, cities, and states, along with an increasingly sophisticated sense of the disciplines that we now call library science and information management (and I would put this high on my list of the great collaborative projects that remain to be done for the Renaissance period). Rather, I will look at some of the materials and metaphors that frame our work in archives and, in particular, urge us to think more deeply about the peculiar place of dust.

Karen Newman and Jane Tylus ask in their Introduction to this wide-ranging group of essays on the uses of translation in an era formative for the modern age. The early modern period saw cross-cultural translation on a massive scale. Humanists negotiated status by means of their literary skills as translators of culturally prestigious Greek and Latin texts, as teachers of those same languages, and as purveyors of the new technologies for the dissemination of writing. Indeed, with the emergence of new vernaculars and new literatures came a sense of the necessary interactions of languages in a moment that can truly be defined as ""after Babel.""&#x0D; As they take their starting point from a wide range of primary sources—the poems of Louise Labé, the first Catalan dictionary, early printed versions of the Ptolemy world map, the King James Bible, and Roger Williams's Key to the Language of America—the contributors to this volume provide a sense of the political, religious, and cultural stakes for translators, their patrons, and their readers. They also vividly show how the very instabilities engendered by unprecedented linguistic and technological change resulted in a far more capacious understanding of translation than what we have today.&#x0D; &#x0D; A genuinely interdisciplinary volume, Early Modern Cultures of Translation looks both east and west while at the same time telling a story that continues to the present about the slow, uncertain rise of English as a major European and, eventually, world language.",,Anne E.

Reflecting these themes, the volume celebrates the intellectual legacy of Carlos Eire's scholarship, applying his distinctive combination of cultural and religious history to new areas and topics. In so doing it underlines the extent to which the relationship between the natural and the supernatural in the early modern world was dynamic, contentious, and always urgent. Organized around three sections - 'Connecting the Natural and the Supernatural', 'Bodies in Motion: Mind, Soul, and Death' and 'Living One's Faith' - the essays are bound together by the example of Eire's scholarship, ensuring a coherence of approach that makes the book crucial reading for scholars of the Reformation, Christianity and early modern cultural history.",,H.C.

Ingram bring together recent scholarship from distinguished experts in history, theology, and literature to make clear that God not only survived the Enlightenment but thrived within it as well. The Enlightenment was not a radical break from the past in which Europeans jettisoned their intellectual and institutional inheritance. It was, to be sure, a moment of great change, but one in which the characteristic convictions and traditions of the Renaissance and Reformation were perpetuated to the point of transformation, in the wake of the Wars of Religion and during the early phases of globalization. The Enlightenment's primary imperatives were not freedom and irreligion but peace and prosperity. As a result, Enlightenment could be Christian, communitarian, or authoritarian as easily as it could be atheistic, individualistic, or libertarian.&#x0D; &#x0D; Honing in on the intellectual crisis of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries while moving from Spinoza to Kant and from India to Peru, God in the Enlightenment takes a prism to the age of lights.",,H.C.

Chapters examine intellectual and practical opportunities to analyse what is at stake when the plays of Shakespeare's contemporaries are performed by ours. Whether experimenting with original performance practices or contemporary theatrical and cinematic ones, productions of early modern drama offer an inspiring, sometimes unusual, always interesting perspective on the plays they interpret for modern audiences.",,Jeremy Lopez,Performing Early Modern Drama Today,"Pascale Aebischer, Kathryn Prince",,,,Cambridge University Press,,,Student Theatre and the Drama of Shakespeare’s Contemporaries,2012

Maya site of San Bartolo in Guatemala, as well as provides insights into artistic attribution and understanding of workshop practices in the archaeological past. Through both stylistic and compositional analysis of the murals, multiple artistic hands are identified and confirmed. This integrated analysis characterizes the painting technique and the development of figural features; examines wall preparation through the application and finishing of plaster; and studies the spatial distribution of specific colorant hue compositional groups. Reliance on multiple lines of evidence enables a comprehensive reconstruction of collaborative workshop practice and understanding of artistic identity, while at the same time informs future conservation of the in situ murals.",,"Caitlin O'Grady, Heather Hurst","Beyond Iconography: Materials, Methods, and Meaning in Ancient Surface Decoration.

12410,FA-57142-13,"This chapter undertakes a defamiliarizing reading of the dominant Archaic genre, the Homeric epic. Taking his cue from Bakhtin's theorization of the novel as a hybrid genre, Faraone points out that the Homeric poems analogously draw on and incorporate preexistent genres. In the case of the Iliad, a text that is to a great extent constituted within an oral tradition, the recognition of its multi-genred nature reveals divergent intents that a holistic reading (in the Neo-Unitarian paradigm of Homeric criticism) would seek to downplay or explain away. Faraone applies this approach to what is one of the best-known texts in European literature, the first book of the Iliad. Pointing to inconsistencies in characterization of Achilles and Agamemnon, as well as to a number of other textual clues, he proposes to regard a substantial segment of the book—the Chryses episode—as a cult hymn originally performed in a ritual context and then incorporated into the Panhellenic text of Homer.",,Christopher Faraone,Persistent Forms: Explorations in Historical Poetics,"I.

12431,FA-57755-14,"From 1840-1870, François Delsarte's course in applied aesthetics trained opera singers and orators in his system of gestural and vocal signs (""semeiotique""). Delsarte provided performers with mental, physical, and spiritual tools to inquire into human nature. Delsarte's aesthetic form of inquiry is paradoxical: he draws on contemporaneous scientific methods while his intellectual framework cites pre-modern sources, chiefly Augustine and Aquinas.  Delsarte's performer utilizes semiotic methods, based on these earlier sources' understanding of sign, to represent the dramatic character's mind, life, and soul. Representing triadic human nature thus draws the performer closer to the triune nature of God. This paper argues that Delsarte's ostensibly scientific semeiotique rests on concepts of reason and inquiry that derive from his mid-19th-century turn to neglected sources in philosophy.",,Iris Smith Fischer,Semiotics 2014: The Semiotics of Paradox,,978-1-897493-5,,,Legas,,,Paradoxes of Reason and Inquiry in the Aesthetics of Francois Delsarte,2015

Of particular interest has been his appropriation of Anselm of Canterbury's innovation that the will has a twofold affection or inclination, one for justice (affectio iustitiae) and the other for happiness (affectio commodi). In adopting Anselm's theory, Scotus's made the affection for justice the primary source of freedom in the will by construing it as a restraint on the natural drive for happiness.  This development in Scotus has been seen as important as a proto-Kantian rejection of eudaimonism by making justice rather than happiness the center of morality.

The BPS disambiguation model is a formal implementation of the traditional heuristics used by humanists, and supports plug-in rules for adaptation to a wide range of domain corpora.

We contrast the BPS model of configurable heuristic rules to other approaches for automated text analysis, and explain how our model facilitates interpretation by humanist researchers.

13014,FA-232749-16,"In the late sixth century, John of Ephesus's Church History and Lives of the Eastern Saints drew on familiar narratives of early Christian martyrdom to encourage Christians who rejected the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE) to endure earthly sufferings that he claimed were caused by imperially sanctioned persecution [rdifuta] against God's true saints.   From a historical perspective, however, Daniel Washburn has noted several differences between these centuries, such as Constantine's use of the familiar Roman punishment of banishment with increasing frequency for religious minorities and with a new rhetorical goal of reform through conversion to imperial orthodoxy, leading Éric Fournier to question whether the use of the term ""persecution"" for Christian rulers' treatment of dissident Christians might be misleading.   After all, unlike their earlier counterparts, most of the heroes in John's sixth-century stories seem to have been more in danger of hypothermia from the winter cold in exile or prison than of being torn limb from limb by wild beasts in a Roman arena.  Despite these differences, however, later Christians who were at odds with imperial orthodoxy produced narratives that instead stressed their parallels with earlier Christians, claiming that the concern for eternal salvation that motivated their defiance was the same; their suffering, equivalent; and their steadfast saints equally martyrs.  This paper will argue that although the empire's treatment of Christians who refused to participate in key ritual offerings shifted from the second to the sixth century, John of Ephesus interpreted the ostensibly kinder and gentler reform-minded later imperial pressure as equally threatening to Christians' eternal salvation as earlier pressures had been, which for him justified narrating the stories of his exiled saints through the familiar rhetoric of martyrdom and persecution.",,Christine Shepardson,Heirs of  Roman Persecution: Studies on a Christian and para-Christian Discourse in Late Antiquit,"Wendy Mayer, Eric Fournier",,,,Routledge,,,Martyrs of Exile: John of Ephesus and Religious Persecution in Late Antiquity,2017

13027,FT-61787-14,"Taking my cue from Johann Zoffany's ""The Auriol and Dashwood Families"" (1783-87) painted in Calcutta, I will look at the intersections between material culture, botanizing, and cultivating tea in late eighteenth-century Bengal. Zoffany's group portrait of a tea party in a Calcutta garden was completed just around the time British naturalists and East India Company officials were discussing the commercial potential of the tea plant. As letters and specimens circulated between Calcutta, London, and Canton, a Chinese exotic was about to be transformed into a British colonial commodity despite anxieties about its medical effects and cultural impact. My essay focuses on the diverse but related visual realms that played key roles in reinventing Chinese tea as a commercial product and a fashionable drink. As importantly, they were mediated through different registers of taste deeply embedded in readings of British character and sensibility. Such readings in turn, would have a profound impact on transplanting Chinese tea in India. In 1786, Colonel Robert Kyd created a botanical garden in Calcutta with the strategic goal to experiment with growing Chinese tea, among other lucrative plants. If successful, the plan would relieve the East India Company of their dependence on the China Trade. It would also usher in a distinctly ""British"" visual culture of tea drinking in a colonial landscape. Thus, I look at how the aesthetics of tea consumption, inspired by a Chinese import, were transplanted in Britain's emergent tea-growing enclave--India.",,Romita Ray,"""De/siring India: Representations through British and French Eyes (1584-1857).""",Niranjan Goswami,,,,Kolkata: Jadavpur University Press.,,,“Canton to Calcutta: Tea and Chinoiserie in a Colonial Garden.”,2018

13051,FT-58220-10,"This article examines illustrations of Huguenot violence in the book that is arguably the most important sixteenth-century geographical text on France, François de Belleforest's Cosmographie Universelle (1575). Working with printers Nicolas Chesneau and Michel Sonnius, Belleforest adapted and expanded Sebastian Münster's geography (Cosmographia, first published in German in 1544) for a French audience. Drawing on information collected from sources all over the country, Belleforest composed an entirely new section on France. Here geography and history interact. In this long and detailed text, the Catholic author engages with contemporary events – the ongoing civil wars – in images that mark the spread of heresy through France. These include images of the Huguenots themselves – those Belleforest designates as heretics – and, especially, images of places attacked and ruined: the text accumulates examples of destroyed churches, monasteries, convents, and towns. The resulting description presents a country ravaged by those the author names ""heretical Huguenots."" My analysis situates these examples of physical devastation within Belleforest's larger geographical project. He uses these examples in two notable ways: as a mapping strategy, to identify the many locations of destruction; and as a polemical gesture, to highlight the firm Catholic convictions of the inhabitants of many towns throughout France and, ultimately, of the author himself. Strikingly, most of the woodcut engravings of cities and towns that accompany the written description of France do not show any evidence of the physical devastation. This examination concludes with a consideration of one fascinating exception: a city view that displays destroyed sites in an otherwise empty landscape, a striking visual rendering of the absence caused by Huguenot and Catholic violence.",,Kendall Tarte,Representing Heresy in Early Modern France,Gabriella Scarlatta and Lidia Radi,,http://crrs.ca/publications/representing-heresy-in-early-modern-france/,,Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies,,,"""Mapping Heresy in François de Belleforest’s Cosmographie Universelle""",2017
13056,HB-231968-16,"Because an increasing number of patients have medical conditions that render them incompetent at making their own medical choices, more and more medical choices are now made by surrogates, often patient family members. However, many studies indicate that surrogates often do not discharge their responsibilities adequately, and in particular, do not choose in accordance with what those patients would have chosen for themselves, especially when it comes to end-of-life medical choices. This chapter argues that a significant part of the explanation of such surrogate failure is that family surrogates are likely to undergo anticipatory grief when making end-of-life decisions. After clarifying both the emotional structure and object of grief, I propose that the pending death of a loved one induces an emotional conflict in surrogates between the care demanded by their responsibility as surrogates and the attachment surrogates feel toward their dying loved one, an attachment surrogates ""resolve"" in the direction of attachment rather than care. This hypothesis helps to explain both surrogates' general inability to exercise ""substituted judgment"" on behalf of their loved ones and a wide swath of the particular data regarding this inability (e.g., that surrogates more often err by choosing overtreatment). I conclude by considering possible clinical and philosophical responses to this hypothesis.",,Michael Cholbi,Ethics at the End of Life: New Issues and Arguments,John Davis,9781138829756,https://www.routledge.com/Ethics-at-the-End-of-Life-New-Issues-and-Arguments/Davis/p/book/9781138829756,,Routledge,,,Grief and End-of-life Surrogate Decision Making,2017

This chapter examines the relationship between timbre and language, offering a critical review of theoretical and empirical thought on timbre semantics and providing a preliminary cognitive linguistic account of timbre description. It first traces the major conceptual and methodological advances in psychological timbre research since the 1970s with a focus on the mediating role of verbalization in previous paradigms. It then discusses the cognitive mechanisms underlying how listeners map timbral qualities onto verbal attributes. Applying a cognitive linguistic approach, the chapter concludes that timbre description may reflect certain fundamental aspects of human embodiment, which may help account for certain trans-historical and cross-cultural consistencies in descriptive practices.",,"Wallmark, Zachary, Kendall, Roger A.",The Oxford Handbook of Timbre,"Rehding, Alexander, Dolan, Emily I.",,,,Oxford University Press,,,Describing Sound: The Cognitive Linguistics of Timbre,2018

13142,AQ-51123-14,"A Peace Pedagogy from the Borderlines   What is peace? It may seem that the answer is self-evident, only its path to realization tangled, obscure, and impossible to sustain. That is certainly the assumption of our students. Yet, the question of ""what is peace"" is an enduring one, without a single answer. Therefore, the underlying assumption of the course we have developed is that concepts of peace are mutable: changing with time, as well as with cultural, religious, and geopolitical perspectives. Our challenge is to resist the urge to arrive at a final definition, or even to develop a map for constructing peace in a modern conflict. Rather, we and our students repeatedly ask ourselves what is peace as we try to unpack its variegated meanings. Our task together is critical, made acute because this will be the only course about peace our students will ever encounter during their tenure at our university. Our goal, at once modest and ambitious, is to instigate thought about peace; to provoke discussion, and exploration; to render peace worthy of seriousness, challenging the old-fashioned stereotypes many of our students may share that peace is a mere relic of a bygone Vietnam ""hippie"" era or an unobtainable fantasy.  Instead, and together with them, we scrutinize many of the linguistic and historical conditions of peace amid the lacunae of the broader strokes rendered by wars that comprise so much of recorded history (Boulding 2000: 16). Like war, peace happened, too. This startles many students. Often history or political science courses ignore, or fail to make explicit, the reality that many accomplishments in history require freedom from direct violence. Because peace, unlike war, lacks a narrative arc, it often seems more difficult to grasp. Peace can seem ambiguous or even irrelevant, for example, often muted in survey history courses.",SUBSCRIPTION OR PURCHAS ONLY,"Renee Bricker, Yi Deng, Donna A.

After Europeans began to cross the Atlantic with confidence, they interacted for three hundred years with one another, with the native people of the region, and with enslaved Africans in ways that made the South a significant arena of imperial ambition.

For those who are curious about how the broad processes of historical change influenced particular people and places, the contributors offer key examples of colonial encounter. This volume includes essays on all three imperial powers, Spain, Britain, and France, and their imperial projects in the American South.

13438,RA-228592-15,"Michael Lundblad's edited collection, Animalities, is a timely intervention in literary and cultural criticism, appearing at a moment when, as Lundblad points out, the burgeoning interdisciplinary fields of animal studies, critical animal studies, human-animal studies, and posthumanism are becoming increasingly prominent in mainstream academia. In his illuminating introduction to the volume, Lundblad pauses to reflect on the usefulness of a wildly varied area of study that incorporates wide-ranging, and often contradictory, methodological approaches and ideologies. This variety has an immediate impact, as Lundblad indicates, on the ever-evolving classificatory apparatus that is deployed to define interest in the animal, the human, and animal-human relations – in addition to those mentioned above, Lundblad also describes animality studies, humanimal studies, and species studies as producing a proliferating cloud of terminology (1). One aim of this book then, is not to contribute further to any diffusion of common interest, but instead to focus on ‘a set of dynamics that move beyond the human […] that construct animals, on the one hand, or humans in relation to animals, on the other hand, or both' (1–2). Lundblad identifies three primary ‘forms' scholarship takes, human-animal studies, animality studies, and posthumanism, and proceeds to provide a valuable distinction between the three. This introduction lays out a clear and precise context for what follows, but is not didactic in its operation – as Lundblad wisely emphasises, he has ‘resist[ed] the impulse' to label the work of his contributors (11).",,Colleen Boggs,Animalities: Literary and Cultural Studies Beyond the Human,Michael Lundblad,9781474400022,https://www.bsls.ac.uk/reviews/general-and-theory/michael-lundblad-ed-animalities-literary-and-cultural-studies-beyond-the-human/,,Edinburgh University Press,,,"Love Triangle With Dog: 'Whym Chow,' the 'Michael Fields,"" and the Poetic Potential of Human-Animals' Affective Bonds",2017

Second, to chart some visual tropes that informed, or emerged from, this practice in a range of distribution venues, including illustrated books, organizational newsletters, and pictorial magazines.

Attention to material objects in the play has focused on Admetus' infamous vow to have a likeness made of Alcestis' body so that he can embrace it in his bed (d?µa? t? s?? e??as???, 348-349). In this chapter, this likeness initiates a reading the play that exemplifies what I am calling tragedy's morbid materialism. The argument is indebted to two recent and related theoretical positions: Jane Bennett's defense of vital materialism on the one hand and Bonnie Honig's critique of mortalist humanism, on the other. The former introduces an argument for the singularity of the human corpse as an inanimate or post-animate object; the latter situates this singularity in terms of the shared finitude of living humans and non-living things. Together, these positions provide a theoretical basis for understanding the material, ontological, and epistemological effects of Alcestis' death and improbable return to life.",,Karen Bassi,The Materialities of Greek Tragedy,"Melissa Meuller, Mario Telo",978-1-3500-287,https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-materialities-of-greek-tragedy-9781350028791/,Publisher's website,Bloomsbury Academic,,,Morbid Materialism: The Matter of the Corpse in Euripides' Alcestis,2018
13717,HB-251108-17,"Abstract (148 words): This paper focuses on the ghost in tragedy as a singular instance of re-performance. The argument starts from two related premises. First, that as an embodied specter the tragic ghost emphasizes the temporal and ontological contingencies that define the relationship between a dramatic actor and his character. Second, that the tragic ghost is a figure for disavowing, i.e., both acknowledging and resisting, the finality of death. Following a discussion of dramatic imitation (µ?µ?s??) as a means of ""leading souls"" (???a????a) in Plato and Aristotle, I argue that re-performance is exemplified in the tragic ghost's uncanny return from the dead. Here re-performance is not a matter of theater history or reception but of dramatic µ?µ?s?? as the visible and audible return of the dead among the living.

A Companion to Renaissance Poetry analyzes the historical, cultural, political, and religious background of the time, addressing issues such as education, translation, the Reformation, theorizations of poetry, and more. The book immerses readers in non-dramatic poetry from Wyatt to Milton, focusing on the key poetic genres—epic, lyric, complaint, elegy, epistle, pastoral, satire, and religious poetry. It also offers an inclusive account of the poetic production of the period by canonical and less canonical writers, female and male. Finally, it offers examples of current developments in the interpretation of Renaissance poetry, including economic, ecological, scientific, materialist, and formalist approaches.  • Covers a wide selection of authors and texts  • Features contributions from notable authors, scholars, and critics across the globe  • Offers a substantial section on recent and developing approaches to reading Renaissance poetry  A Companion to Renaissance Poetry is an ideal resource for all students and scholars of the literature and culture of the Renaissance period.",Print book,Patricia Fumerton,A Companion to Renaissance Poetry,Catherine Bates,978-1-118-5851,https://www.wiley.com/en-us/A+Companion+to+Renaissance+Poetry-p-9781118585191,Link to publisher page,Wiley-Blackwell,,,Digging ‘Veritable Dunghills’: The Re-Appreciation of English Broadside Ballads,2017

14110,FT-259722-18,"This chapter offers a South Asian history of the disagreement about how best to handle scientific expertise in the criminal courtroom. The debate comparing adversarialism and inquisitorialism had long raged in Anglo-American and European settings. Was it best to rely on the single court-appointed expert (inquisitorialism from Roman law in continental Europe), or to hear partisan experts present competing and often contradictory views in the ""marketplace of ideas"" (Anglo adversarialism)? The debate took on new shape in colonial India. When dominated by British figures like Punjab Chemical Examiner William Center in the 1870s and High Court judge Douglas Young in the 1930s, both sides of the debate absorbed colonial stereotypes reflecting the perceived imperatives of British rule. With the rise of South Asians in the professions (both legal and scientific), the colonial stereotype of ""native mendacity"" fell out of the debate. Medical jurisprudence treatise author J. P. Modi (from the 1920s on) and Madras High Court judge P. N. Ramaswami (1955) shed earlier English and colonial associations around the adversarial-inquisitorial debate. All sides worried about the risk of falsity and wrongful convictions—whether caused by competing partisan experts, the unaccountable solo lab expert, ""native mendacity,"" or judicially unsupervised police. At issue were questions about the viability and mechanics of the search for truth across professionalized fields of knowledge in a once-colonial context.

14123,FT-229574-15,"This chapter examines the phenomenon of counterinsurgency as a form of militarized development.  It is particularly interested in the social and spatial dimensions of counterinsurgency, and in the ways in which counterinsurgency theorists and practitioners seek to construct, manipulate and control populations and spaces.  It considers these practices in a particular historical context: the province of B?n Tre in South Vietnam, in the years leading up to a famous uprising organized by communist partisans in 1960.  The evidence presented here—drawn from South Vietnamese government records and communist accounts—shows that the government's initial apparent successes in pacification in B?n Tre and its subsequent failure to anticipate or prevent the 1960 uprising turned mainly on its development schemes, such as its ill-fated Agroville Program, launched in 1959.  By analyzing space and spatial practices as foundational elements of counterinsurgency, historians can better understand the ways in which counterinsurgency wars often combine ever more ambitious development schemes with increasingly destructive uses of military force.",,Edward Miller,The Development Century: A Global History,"Erez Manela, Stephen Macekura",9781316515884,https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=1316515885,,Cambridge University Press,,,"Development, Space and Counterinsurgency in Vietnam's Ben Tre Province, 1954-1960",2018

The Life of Sidney appeared as in favour of mixed monarchy held up by a virtuous aristocracy against the tyranny of the interregnum government, while the Remains offers virtuous, consultative monarchy, fully invested in ‘popularity', against tyranny and in full favour of toleration. This complex picture stands against the dark machinations of the Cabal government in 1670, in which Charles II played off his Privy Council advisers one against another.

One strong measure to reduce the tensions that might lead to conflicts over such commodified aspects of the environment was the development of corporate kinship groups that established exclusive access to certain land parcels (among other resources) to their members; abiotic resources were also claimed exclusively, such as names, symbols, and myths. A cor-related development was the expression of corporate identities, signs that distinguished one corporate group from all others. While many of those signs may have been lost to prehistorians, others have survived.

Many studies have shown that public institutions are an important determinant of long-run rates of economic growth. This book argues that to understand the difficulties and pitfalls of state building in the contemporary world, it is necessary to analyze previous efforts to create institutional capacity in conflictive contexts. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the process of state and nation building in Latin America and Spain from independence to the 1930s. The book examines how Latin American countries and Spain tried to build modern and efficient state institutions for more than a century - without much success. The Spanish and Latin American experience of the nineteenth century was arguably the first regional stage on which the organizational and political dilemmas that still haunt states were faced.

15279,HD-51852-14,"Contemporary Archaeology and the City' foregrounds the archaeological study of post-industrial and other urban transformations through a diverse, international collection of case studies. Over the past decade contemporary archaeology has emerged as a dynamic force for dissecting and contextualizing the material complexities of present-day societies. In doing so it challenges conventional anthropological and archaeological conceptions of the past by pushing temporal boundaries closer to, if not into, the present. The volume is organized around three themes that highlight the multifaceted character of urban life in present-day cities--creativity, ruination, and political action. The case studies in this volume offer comparative perspectives on transformative global, urban processes in local contexts, including the struggling, post-industrial cities of Detroit, Belfast, Indianapolis, Berlin, Liverpool, Bele´m, and post-apartheid Cape Town, as well as the thriving urban centres of Melbourne, New York City, London, Chicago, and Istanbul. Contributions demonstrate how the contemporary city is a palimpsest composed of archaeological assemblages--of the built environment, the surfaces, and buried subsurface--that retain traces of the various pasts entangled with one another in the present.

15404,HD-248377-16,"Depictions of the Holocaust in history, literature, and film became a focus of intense academic debate in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, with the passing of the eyewitness generation and the rise of comparative genocide studies, the Holocaust's privileged place not only in scholarly discourse but across Western society has been called into question.  Probing the Ethics of Holocaust Culture is a searching reappraisal of the debates and controversies that have shaped Holocaust studies over a quarter century. This landmark volume brings international scholars of the founding generation of Holocaust studies into conversation with a new generation of historians, artists, and writers who have challenged the limits of representation through their scholarly and cultural practices. Focusing on the public memorial cultures, testimonial narratives, and artifacts of cultural memory and history generated by Holocaust remembrance, the volume examines how Holocaust culture has become institutionalized, globalized, and variously contested. Organized around three interlocking themes—the stakes of narrative, the remediation of the archive, and the politics of exceptionality—the essays in this volume explore the complex ethics surrounding the discourses, artifacts, and institutions of Holocaust remembrance.  From contrasting viewpoints and, in particular, from the multiple perspectives of genocide studies, the authors question if and why the Holocaust should remain the ultimate test case for ethics and a unique reference point for how we understand genocide and crimes against humanity.",Printed book,"Claudio Fogu, Todd Presner","Probing the Ethics of Holocaust Culture : The Roots of Militarism, 1866–1945","Wulf Kansteiner, Claudio, Todd Presner",9780674970519,https://www.worldcat.org/title/probing-the-ethics-of-holocaust-culture-the-roots-of-militarism-18661945/oclc/992453786&amp;referer=brief results,Entry in WorldCat,Harvard University Press,http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674970519,Entry in Harvard University Press Catalog,"Interview with Anne Knowles, Tim Cole, Alberto Giordano, and Paul Jaskot",2016

15495,FT-60454-13,"This paper addresses the ideological role of archaeology during the early decades of the French conquest of territory of Algeria and the appropriation of the prehistoric and Roman past by French archaeologists in the newly created European colony. By focusing on the period between 1830 and 1870, the years when colonial Algeria fell under the authority of the Minister of War, I draw attention to the inherent problems of the traditional telling of the history of classical archaeology in North Africa divorced from the context of the war since most of those involved also served as officers in the French army. In particular, I focus on the marked absence of indigenous Arab and Berber witnesses from the history of archaeology in Algeria, which is much in contrast to recent studies of Egyptian and Tunisian excavations, where locals played a much more active role in roughly the same time period.

This chapter challenges the belief that fear cannot work and is, indeed, counterproductive. The chapter then turns to the ethical debate, which for years was shaped by bioethics. The chapter concludes by arguing that the perspective of bioethics, so centrally concerned with the individual, provides an inadequate moral frame for thinking about fear-based campaigns. Instead, the chapter proposes the notion of public health ethics, which has as its grounding principle the enhancement of population well-being.

As corporate entities such as Stitcher Premium begin to place old episodes behind paywalls and academic archives such as the one that gives this book its namesake aim to freely preserve podcasts and their accompanying metadata for researchers, the history of podcasts, as recent as it may be, has begun to prove valuable for both business and academic purposes.

In the context of the evolving professionalization of podcasting, I examine the cultural divide emerging in the post-Serial podcasting world between public radio and commercial interests on one side (""pro-casters"") and communities of independent audio producers (""podcasters"") on the other. Looking specifically at female independent podcasters, I discuss the contours of their production culture and the concerns of these producers as podcasting became commercialized. The distinctive production cultures generated by ""podcasters as bloggers""- perhaps imperfect, done piece-meal, at the hands of a distracted producer, and without priority - are far different than those offered in the offices of NPR or in the garages of male amateurs. For some ""stay-at-home"" podcasters, I analyze how discussions about podcast production align with the demands of care work and family life for women as imagined within contemporary discourses of neoliberal feminism. Through an analysis of one of many distinctive subcultures marginalized in early accounts of podcasting's origins, we can glimpse how the pursuit of perfect audio and commercial success influence the stories that journalists and scholars choose to tell about podcasting. ""Tidying up"" the histories of this young medium is essential work with material effects. The ways we compose narratives about the development of podcasting privileges certain voices and mutes others.

And how can we empirically analyze these techniques and differences? Through digital tools that measure fine-grained aspects of vocal performances, we pinpoint clear differences between various genres of podcasting and intervene into the debates surrounding vocal delivery. First, we look at meditation and news podcasts to find a baseline for controlled vocal delivery.

Finally, I will outline how the database works as a tool to make this chaotic discourse legible as a case study. I believe that studying this discourse can provide a more nuanced understanding of how we as a society publicly address issues of race and the reasons we might shy away from these conversations or frame them as the aberrant actions of an individual rather than a product of systemic racism. Meanwhile, studying these concerns through the PodcastRE database does not just provide us with different perspectives and interpretations but also gives us their meaningful contrast.

Utilizing the PodcastRE metadata analytics applications, I argue that keywords are one critical area where podcasters negotiate and exert agency through self- identification apart from the dominant presence of the search engine algorithms within commercial podcatcher applications. They do this by establishing their own relational networks that foreground defining their publics, using keywords to signal to their audience their respective ideologies. Concurrently, I analyze the politics of podcatching applications as they continue to influence how podcasters apply keywords, resulting in the most common keywords reflecting pre-defined iTunes categories. While podcasts are often framed as an approachable audio practice amenable to amateurs due to lower barriers of entry, podcatcher applications act as cultural intermediaries between listener and content creator. They reify the growing hierarchical star systems that pertain to the podcasting ecosystem, leading to a palpable impact in the way podcasts and metadata are produced. By shifting the focus of analysis from the podcast to the periphery of its metadata, novel observations can be made about the contextual dimensions of podcasting culture.

There are certainly advantages to the affordances provided by digital formats (i.e. metadata, automated collection, elaborate tools for the visualization of sound waves etc.) but I argue we still need to foreground sound itself in our methods and audio collections. Developing sonic methodologies in conjunction with more traditional/typical digital methodologies for sound and audio archives will expand the utility of sound databases and will also help alleviate the problems that accompany the primacy of the visual (Hilmes, 2005; Sterne, 2003) afforded to most archives. Approaching sound archives and objects sonically, instead of just visually or textually, offers new perspectives and paths for research, since, as Tara Rodgers notes, ""vibrations – including that specific class of audible vibrations experienced as sound – present alternative ways of apprehending reality that can point to political sensibilities that emphasize complexity, interconnection and interdependence rather than modes of distancing and control"" (Rodgers, 2018: 234).

16766,BH-261712-18,"An unbroken tradition of protest song has survived for centuries off the coast of the states of Georgia and South Carolina. The carriers of this tradition are known as the Gullah.  The Gullah are descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to America for their rice-growing skills. For generations they have resided on the Sea Islands and Coastal Lowlands of South Carolina and Georgia. Given their geographic isolation, the Gullah have retained more of their African cultural heritage than any other group of African Americans (Opala 1986). On the islands, as in Africa, singing has long been a daily part of work and play, prayer and protest. The rhythmic drive of the drums, so prevalent in Africa, was transferred to body percussion to replace the banned instrument (Southern 1997). These performance practices accompanied two song styles: short musical phrases with variations in repetition; and call-and-response, in which one singer leads and is supported by a group (ibid, 14-15).",,"Robert W.

16895,HAA-261271-18,"This paper uses the historiography of Syriac and Coptic Studies to reconsider and recast the origin story of rapidly rising field in the academy, namely the Digital Humanities. Origin stories about the Digital Humanities (or ""humanities computing"" as it was known in its early years) often begin with Fr. Roberto Busa, a theologian and Aquinas scholar who teamed up with IBM's Thomas J. Watson to produce the computing infrastructure behind the print publication of the Index Thomisticus. The Index Thomisticus can also be understood as an act of cultural heritage preservation and promotion; this early humanities computing was in the service of studying and eventually digitizing a pillar of the Western canon.  The paper advocates broadening our horizons for identifying ""origin moments"" or ""origin points"" in the field of Digital Humanities, particularly as DH intersects with religion, Christianity, and Christian canons.  Cultural heritage groups outside the Catholic and Protestant American mainstream conducted early digitization of Christian literary sources and scholarship. The work of Coptic Orthodox Christians and Syrian Christians to digitize Coptic and Syriac literature, promote open access scholarship, publish on digital platforms, and engage in ""public humanities"" (all central elements of what we now understand ""digital humanities"" to be) were, like Busa's Index Thomisticus, acts of cultural heritage preservation and acts of digital humanities pioneering.",,Caroline T.

16906,RA-259286-18,"This article focuses on the history of recreational sites in the Taksim area of Istanbul, from their use in the late nineteenth century through their transformation over time. It argues for the importance of preserving historic recreation sites that carry significance for urban residents as spaces where individual and collective social histories have played out. The site that is now termed Taksim Square and Gezi Park has, and continues to be, a charged site of protest where power struggles have taken place between individuals, communities and municipal powers. Most recently, in 2013, this struggle revolved around preserving the square and the park as a public space. While it is important to preserve the park and square, it is also important to lend voice to the various histories that lie buried within this site. Turkey's dominant political leadership not only employs a neo-Ottoman aesthetic in the neo-liberal development plan for Turkey's major cities, but it is also resurrecting symbols that represent the late-Ottoman project of modernity. This study articulates a counter-narrative to a selective preservation of late-Ottoman history to ask if and how the people's gardens truly served the ""public benefit"" in the past, which publics they served, and how various communities exerted effort to acquire access to and visibility within these spaces.",print and ebook,Berin Gölönü,"Commoning the City:  Empirical Perspectives on Urban Ecology, Economics, and Ethics","Güldem Baykal Büyüksaraç, Derya Özkan",9780367076566,https://www.routledge.com/Commoning-the-City-Empirical-Perspectives-on-Urban-Ecology-Economics/Ozkan-Buyuksarac/p/book/9780367076566,Publisher Routledge's presentation of the book,Routledge,,,From Graveyards to the ‘People’s Gardens’: the Making of Public Leisure Space in Istanbul,2020
16914,RA-228605-15,"To be ""a real country"", Frank Zappa wrote, ""at the very least you need a beer.""  In the context of Turkey, however, the place of beer has often been contested.  Since before the republic's 1923 establishment, Turkish national identity enjoyed a strong association with the equally strong anise-flavoured spirit raki.  Meanwhile, Islamic conservatives like President Erdogan point to non-alcoholic yogurt-based ayran as their alternative. While such debates attract a great deal of attention in discussion of the country's secular–religious divide, in practice, beer long rivalled – and often far surpassed – raki in its scales of production, profits, consumption, availability, and even politicisation. Though beer originated in Ancient times in the greater Fertile Crescent region, it was reintroduced to Anatolia as a European beverage linked with modern brewery production and the Bomonti brothers in the late Ottoman era. It survived the empire's fall and a short-lived prohibition of alcohol in the early 1920s to become a prized concern for Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's national republic, which consolidated its production under the state monopoly TEKEL. Profiting from its consumption, the state paradoxically promoted beer while it encouraged moderation. Following beer's history through subsequent developments brought about with rising neoliberalism and political Islam, beer became a major symbol of resistance in the 1913 Gezi Park protests and since amid ongoing Islamist and public health pressures to further regulate – or prohibit – alcohol in modern Turkey.",ebook,"Kyle Evered, Emine Evered",Alcohol Flows Across Cultures Drinking Cultures in Transnational and Comparative Perspective,Waltraud Ernst,9780203732038,https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203732038,Publisher access to volume,Routledge,,,Between Promotions and Prohibitions:  the Shifting Symbolisms and Spaces of Beer in Modern Turkey,2020
16927,RA-259260-18,"The volume discusses the world as it was known in the Medieval and Early Modern periods, focusing on projects concerned with mapping as a conceptual and artistic practice, with visual representations of space, and with destinations of real and fictive travel. Maps were often taken as straightforward, objective configurations. However, they expose deeply subjective frameworks with social, political, and economic significance. Travel narratives, whether illustrated or not, can address similar frameworks. Whereas travelled space is often adventurous, and speaking of hardship, strange encounters and danger, city portraits tell a tale of civilized life and civic pride. The book seeks to address the multiple ways in which maps and travel literature conceive of the world, communicate a 'Weltbild', depict space, and/or define knowledge. The volume challenges academic boundaries in the study of cartography by exploring the links between mapmaking and artistic practices. The contributions discuss individual mapmakers, authors of travelogues, mapmaking as an artistic practice, the relationship between travel literature and mapmaking, illustration in travel literature, and imagination in depictions of newly explored worlds.",,"Serchuk, Camille",Maps and Travel in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period,"Baumgärtner, Ingrid, Ben-Aryeh Debby, Nirit, Kogman-Appel, Katrin",9783110587333,https://www.degruyter.com/view/book/9783110588774/10.1515/9783110588774-008.xml,book publisher's website,De Gruyter,,,Around the World: Borders and Frames in Two Sixteenth-Century Norman Map Books,2019

16980,RA-259339-18,"Did American racism originate in the liberal North? An inquiry into the system of institutionalized racism created by Northern Jim Crow  Jim Crow was not a regional sickness, it was a national cancer. Even at the high point of twentieth century liberalism in the North, Jim Crow racism hid in plain sight. Perpetuated by colorblind arguments about ""cultures of poverty,"" policies focused more on black criminality than black equality. Procedures that diverted resources in education, housing, and jobs away from poor black people turned ghettos and prisons into social pandemics. Americans in the North made this history. They tried to unmake it, too.  Liberalism, rather than lighting the way to vanquish the darkness of the Jim Crow North gave racism new and complex places to hide. The twelve original essays in this anthology unveil Jim Crow's many strange careers in the North. They accomplish two goals: first, they show how the Jim Crow North worked as a system to maintain social, economic, and political inequality in the nation's most liberal places; and second, they chronicle how activists worked to undo the legal, economic, and social inequities born of Northern Jim Crow policies, practices, and ideas.  The book ultimately dispels the myth that the South was the birthplace of American racism, and presents a compelling argument that American racism actually originated in the North.",,Ayesha K.

Material and symbolic gains contended with setbacks fueled by resentment and reaction. African American artists responded with black approaches to expression that made history in their own time and continue to exercise an enormous influence on contemporary culture and politics. This collection's fascinating spectrum of topics begins with the literary and cinematic representations of slavery from the 1970s to the present. Other authors delve into visual culture from Blaxploitation to the art of Betye Saar to stage works like A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White as well as groundbreaking literary works like Corregidora and Captain Blackman. A pair of concluding essays concentrate on institutional change by looking at the Seventies surge of black publishing and by analyzing Ntozake Shange's for colored girls... in the context of current controversies surrounding sexual violence.

16986,RZ-230579-15,"3D modeling offers a powerful tool to explore and display the interaction of complex topography and innovative building history in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace. Whole-site reconstructions, however, force the issue of how best to acknowledge the partiality of evidence. This paper addresses the challenges of building virtual representation(s) that include specific buildings or structures that warrant reconstruction but present fundamental uncertainties. Because reconstructions can take on their own reality, strategies for effectively exploring structure, space, and environment while confronting, acknowledging, and communicating the extent of the evidence visually are essential. One approach is to offer choice through iterations that present diverse possibilities for a reconstruction, allowing the viewer to compare, toggle between, or interactively explore the options. But to what extent do multiple iterations confuse rather than clarify a reconstruction? What are the boundaries between archaeological documentation and visual evocation? These issues are raised in order to open discussion on the nature, purpose, and advantages of virtual architectural reconstruction within a non-generic environment. Three case studies centering on the Ionic Porch, the Nike Monument, and the bridges crossing the central ravine present different kinds of uncertainty that we have confronted while using 3D modeling as the emerging engine of architectural investigation in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace.",,B.

Together, these essays show how Victorian thinkers used aesthetic form to engage problems of system, interconnection, and dispossession that remain our own. The authors reconsider Victorian literary structures in light of environmental catastrophe; coordinate ""natural"" questions with sociopolitical ones; and underscore the category of form as a means for generating environmental—and therefore political—knowledge. Moving from the elegy and the industrial novel to the utopian romance, the scientific treatise, and beyond, Ecological Form demonstrates how nineteenth-century thinkers conceptualized the circuits of extraction and violence linking Britain to its global network.

Through an exploration of sites as varied as homes, factories, plantations, markets, and tourism attractions we address the public significance of private sentiments, the resilience of bodies, and gendered interactions in historical contexts.

Although Sikhs and Afghans were the most visible and enduring of these new warrior groups in Punjab, the presence of other clusters suggests that relationships forged in rural revenue collection, access to kinship networks, and the vast demand for military talent throughout the Mughal period created a nexus of opportunities for military entrepreneurs in eighteenth-century Punjab. This chapter will show why factors such as the embrace of new martial skills or ideologies cannot explain by themselves, the efflorescence of warrior groups that emerged in eighteenth-century Punjab.

At the same time, the very unique circumstances under which Mongolian states and empires formed (i.e., pastoral nomadic lifeways, high mobility, low population density, spatially extensive regions) make these early ""nomadic states"" extremely important case studies for anthropological archaeologists interested in the nature of statehood generally (Honeychurch 2014).  Traditionally, archaic states have been associated with intensive agriculture, sedentary lifeways, urbanism, political hierarchy, and administrative centralization but the concept of ""the ancient state"" has been changing as archaeologists explore diverse parts of the world with different lifeway traditions.  As a result, the range of early polities discussed as ""ancient states"" has grown to include substantial organizational variety.  This is clearly reflected in the names for what might be called alternative kinds of states such as city states, segmentary states, theater states, galactic polities, opportunistic states, etc. (e.g., Chapman 2003).

18317,FA-233104-16,"This chapter traces the development of early British abolitionist proceduralism in contestation against colonial slave laws by studying legal cases pursued by Granville Sharp and abolitionist lawyers between 1767 and 1774 involving fugitive slaves in England who had been recaptured by their enslavers, including the famous Ex parte Somerset decision of 1772. Pursuing charges of assault against the kidnappers, lawyers also frequently had recourse to the legal process of the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum et recipiendum, which enabled courts to adjudicate the legality of an individual's detention and to free those unlawfully detained. While historians of law and the British empire have frequently viewed the verdict in Somerset as, at best, confirming English law's ignorance of slavery, such emphasis on legal exceptionalism does not reveal the generalizing remedial capacities of the ruling in an imperial context. Drawing upon Paul D. Halliday's demonstration of the strong remedial and imperial jurisdiction of King's Bench in the eighteenth century, the chapter shows how the entitlement of the slave's vulnerable human body to protection by the common law emerged through abolitionist proceduralism, which framed habeas corpus as a representative legal action. These cases promulgated new definitions of collective ‘rights of humanity' that would not be restricted to slavery alone, but could apply to violated rights of all oppressed persons across the Empire. Concluding with an analysis of two contemporaneous cases where representative habeas corpus actions failed in respect to a deported slave and insolvent debtors, the chapter reveals that collective ‘rights of humanity' based in the natural rights of the individual to personal liberty and bodily integrity could only come into question indirectly in the legal arena when the habeas corpus procedure itself was functioning correctly within a powerful imperial jurisdiction.",book and electronic publication,Sarah Winter,Empire and Legal Thought: Ideas and Institutions from Antiquity to Modernity,Edward Cavanagh,978-90-04-4309,"https://brill.com/view/title/57059#:~:text=Emphatic%20of%20the%20importance%20of,the%20development%20of%20legal%20thought.&amp;text=It%20withstands%20the%20rise%20and,the%20place%20of%20the%20old.",,Brill,https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004431249,,"“From procedural law to the ‘rights of humanity’: Habeas corpus, Ex parte Somerset (1771-72), and the movement toward collective representation in early British antislavery cases”",2020

Perhaps no form of legal personhood has played a greater role in political crises than the ""corpus"" summoned by the writ of habeas corpus. This chapter examines how the habeas corpus judicial process produces a particular sort of legal personification, the corpus, combining an individual human body with a form of legal personhood. Focusing on the famous Ex parte Somerset decision of 1772 in juxtaposition to William Godwin's novel Caleb Williams (1794), it shows that a remedial judicial process such as habeas corpus— - and its fictionalization by novelists— - provides a new vantage on the history of human rights, particularly in respect to the protection of dissidents, the enslaved, or the disenfranchised from private or governmental coercion.",print and e-publication,Sarah Winter,Fictional Discourse and the Law,Hans Lind,978-1138604759,https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429468414,,Routledge,htthttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/fictional-discourse-law-hans-lind/e/10.4324/9780429468414,,“Remedial Fictions: The Novelization of Habeas Corpus and the History of Human Rights”,2020

18447,HAA-263850-19,"Today's digital libraries consist of much more than simple 2D images of manuscript pages or paintings. Advanced imaging techniques – 3D modeling, spectral photography, and volumetric x-ray, for example – can be applied to all types of cultural objects and can be combined to create complex digital representations comprising many disparate parts. In addition, emergent technologies like virtual unwrapping and artificial intelligence (AI) make it possible to create ""born digital"" versions of unseen features, such as text and brush strokes, that are ""hidden"" by damage and therefore lack verifiable analog counterparts. Thus, the need for transparent metadata that describes and depicts the set of algorithmic steps and file combinations used to create such complicated digital representations is crucial. At EduceLab, we create various types of complex digital objects, from virtually unwrapped manuscripts that rely on machine learning tools to create born-digital versions of unseen text, to 3D models that consist of 2D photos, multi- and hyperspectral images, drawings, and 3D meshes. In exploring ways to document the digital provenance chain for these complicated digital representations and then support the dissemination of the metadata in a clear, concise, and organized way, we settled on the use of the Metadata En-coding Transmission Standard (METS). This paper outlines our design to exploit the flexibility and comprehensiveness of METS, particularly its behaviorSec, to meet emerging digital provenance metadata needs.",,"Christy Chapman, C. S.

The chapter (draft) is 80 pages. ABSTRACT: How has contemporary dance theater staged survivor testimony? How might such works embody trauma and the complexities of survival? How might these dances bridge the distance between past and present, history and art, survivors and their pasts and audiences in the present? This chapter focuses on three full-evening pieces that engage with the testimony of specific Jewish, female survivors: Joseph Mills and Ballet Austin's Light: The Holocaust and Humanity Project (2005), based on the life of Naomi Warren (1920–2016), a Polish Jew who survived Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ravensbruck, and Bergen-Belsen; Bill T. Jones and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company's Analogy: Dora/Tramontane (2015), set to the oral history he conducted with Dora Werzberg Amelan (1920–2020), a French Jew of Polish descent who survived the war working for the Jewish underground in French transit camps; and Szabo and The Symptom's Sea Lavender and the Euphoria of Being (2016), which provided Fahidi (b. 1925), a Hungarian-Jewish survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Allendorf (Buchenwald), with a platform to tell her own story.

San Costantino Albanese is a small town in a remote mountainous area of Basilicata called Val Sarmento. It was settled during the sixteenth century by a community of Albanian refugees known as Arbëreshë, as a result of the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans. The community, like that of its neighbour San Paolo Albanese, is part of the Italo-Albanian Byzantine Catholic church and an early-modern form of the Albanian language is spoken in both villages.

18798,RA-259260-18,"This Handbook produces a stereoscopic view of Chaucer's works. Juxtaposing chapters by Middle English scholars with chapters by specialists in other fields – Latin and vernacular literature, philosophy, theology, and history of science – it offers a new perspective that uses the works of Chaucer to look out upon the wider world. Clusters of essays that place Chaucer's works in ""the Mediterranean Frame"" and ""the European Frame"" are bracketed by groupings on ""Biography and Circumstances of Daily Life"" and ""The Chaucerian Afterlife,"" while a cluster on ""Christian Doctrine and Religious Heterodoxy"" foregrounds the role of confessional identities in the emergence of Middle English literary authority. The Handbook's scope addresses the claim of universality that is often implicit in the study of Chaucer's works. Chapters on anti-Judaism in the Canterbury Tales and on Hebrew literature reveal what has been suppressed or elided in the construction of English literary history, while studying the Arabic sources and analogues of the frame tale tradition reveals the patterns of circulation that lie behind the early modern emergence of national literatures. Chapters on French, Italian, and Latin literature address the linguistic context of late fourteenth-century Europe, while chapters on philosophy, history of science, and theology spur on new areas of development within Chaucer studies.

18886,RA-50143-14,"This chapter explores the media–archaeological foundations of trompe l'oeil painting in antiquity, specifically the famous contest between the Greek painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius as recounted by Pliny the Elder. The anecdote is well known: whereas Zeuxis had painted a picture of grapes that deceived the birds who flew up to peck at them, Parrhasius won the palm for deceiving his rival with a painting of a curtain that compelled Zeuxis to ask that it be raised and the picture shown for his appraisal. Modern accounts and even depictions of the contest have taken for granted the formal realism of this painting, its extreme illusionism, as the catalyst of its deceptive power. By contrast, this chapter examines Parrhasius' curtain from a media–theoretical perspective, which considers the order of representation in relation to the experience of beholders in real space. In short, it argues that the success of Parrhasius' picture had less to do with its technical virtuosity than its shrewd understanding of how to produce the conditions for depictive and bodily co-presence.",Subscription,Patrick Crowley,Classics and Media Theory,Pantelis Michelakis,9780198846024,https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198846024.001.0001/oso-9780198846024-chapter-9,,Oxford Scholarship Online,,,"""Parrhasius’ Curtain, or, a Media Archaeology of a Metapainting""",2020

Historically represented through fantasies of individualism, frontier ruggedness, and land acquisition, the desert is also the site of extreme social and environmental violence. The Invention of the American Desert brings together a wide-ranging group of interdisciplinary essays that explore, through diverse perspectives, dialectical problems posed by an environment that has served as a testing ground for modernist experimentation, military-industrial incursions, and ecological disasters throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

Foregrounding a decolonial and climate-justice-based approach, this book joins efforts within the environmental humanities in seeking to widen considerations of climate change as it intersects with social, political, and cultural realms. It simultaneously expands the nascent branches of ecocritical art history and visual culture, and builds toward the advancement of a robust and critical interdisciplinarity appropriate to the complex entanglements of climate change.

Economists' general preference for parsimonious explanations of human behavior, and for axiomatic answers to normative questions are about as far removed as one can get from the interest of humanities scholars in individual variety and psychological depth, and from humanities scholars' insistence on historically and culturally contextualized approaches to the normative.

19015,RZ-255635-17,"The central role of the architecture for structuring cultural patterns and behaviors is well known for complex sedentary societies. In contrast, hunter-gatherer's relationship to the built environment, particularly mobile hunter-gatherers, is not often discussed in anthropological or archaeological literature (although see Cuenca-Solana, et al. 2018 and references therein; Maher and Conkey 2019; Milner, et al. 2018; Zubrow, et al. 2010). In contrast to the houses of sedentary peoples, hunter-gatherer houses are often described as ephemeral utilitarian shelters without further investigation into their cultural importance. The papers in this volume seek to reframe the conversation around hunter-gatherer houses through exploration of the diversity of hunter-gatherers' interaction with the built environment. The papers span broad temporal and cross-cultural ranges to understanding hunter-gatherer houses, exploring the use of architecture across time and space. Through these collected ideas, we hope that readers gain a new understanding of the importance of both ephemeral and persisting architecture for hunter-gatherer communities and cultures. Creating a sense of home is not limited to sedentary communities who construct permanent houses; mobile peoples also have meaningful relationships with architecture and use the built environment to help structure their world view.",,"Danielle A.

19016,RZ-255635-17,"The built environment delineates space for daily actions and important moments. Separating the occupants from the external world, walls can create barriers between the outside or can build communities within them. In archaeological literature, the term ‘house' often describes the architecture of settled peoples, painting visual images of sturdy stone structures dotting the landscape in perpetuity. In part, this image is constructed as the result of archaeological preservation; stone houses have longevity, with foundations and walls standing for thousands of years. In contrast, ephemeral and organic structures such as tents and brush huts are rarely preserved, and thus escape our conceptions of house and home in the past (Maher and Conkey, 2019). Issues of visibility are also intertwined with site function; what is visible archaeologically may be activity areas that do not relate to the domicile, which may be at a different location, and thus not identified in the archaeological record (Briz i Godino et al., 2013, Zubrow et al., 2010). This has led to a bias where mobile peoples are often forgotten in discussions of household archaeology, with a primacy placed on people who build permanent architecture. However, despite our modern biases, hunter-gatherers did (and do) have structures. Furthermore, as recently argued by Maher and Conkey (2019), these structures can convey a sense of ‘home', a concept usually reserved for sedentary people. Homes are where ‘life happens', where people interact with each other and with the objects in their lives. Not only are homes loci for ‘life', they themselves also live, undergoing changes, evolving with the inhabitants, and transitioning through rites of passage (Tringham, 1995). Recent excavations of two structures at Kharaneh IV, an Epipalaeolithic site in Eastern Jordan, provides a window into the lifeways of a hunter-gatherer community by reconstructing the life-history of the structures. These structures are ephemeral brush hut",,"Danielle A. Macdonald, Lisa A. Maher",More Than Shelter from the Storm: Hunter-Gatherer Houses and the Built Environment,"Brian Andrews, Danielle A.

19021,RZ-255635-17,"Between 23 and 11.5 ka Epipaleolithic groups of Southwest Asia initiated and experienced dramatic changes —on a previously unprecedented scale—in economy and settlement, with the appearance of semi-sedentary villages and intensified interdependent relationships with each other and specific plants and animals. These events provide a rare opportunity to study the long-term development of social processes in the region and the increasingly obvious fact that social, economic and technological changes were manifested as complex, entangled and non-linear developments. Most recent attempts to explain change in the material culture record typically highlight the earliest evidence for plant management or cultivation, ritual funerary practices, and dwelling and architecture. While these are important contributions that serve as the foundation for challenging our traditional notions of hunter-gatherer to farmer transitions, they center on changes in the economic or symbolic realms of prehistoric life, arguably downplaying the role of technology. This paper attempts to explore the role of technology in our reconstructions of the lifeways of hunter-gatherers by examining the social role of technology, the centrality of the technological process to everyday practice, and the transmission of technological knowledge (and, thus, culture) through communities of practice. We use chipped stone tools and their associated debris from the site of Kharaneh IV, eastern Jordan, as an illustrative case study of how we currently study chipped stone tools in this region. Using a chaîne opératoire approach to the study of EP assemblages, we consider how different groups of knappers at the EP site of Kharaneh IV, and beyond, interacted in fluid and ever-changing interactions to share knowledge or reinforce existing social traditions.",,"Lisa A.

19029,RZ-255623-17,"Ancient Athens is cited as the contentious caldron from which the western political tradition emerged. During the formative Archaic period (ca. 700-480 BC), Athenian history was marked by major socio-political and religious changes, including the first governmental institutions, formal laws, citizenship formalization, evidence for chattel slavery, social stratification (e.g., classes), and conflict among the aristocratic families, ultimately leading to the rise of democracy. To date, such processes are known to us through texts, artistic representations, and elite-centered mortuary grounds. This project focuses upon the extensive necropolis excavated at the ancient Attic port of Phaleron (ca. 8th-5th centuries BC) by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Western Attica, Piraeus, and the Islands. The size, date, state-of-the-art excavation techniques, preservation, and mortuary variation of the cemetery including apparent diverse non-elite individuals, some shackled and in mass graves, offer us a previously undocumented view of the ancient Athenian past. The collaborative Phaleron Bioarchaeological Project integrates multiple lines of evidence including biological, mortuary, and ceramic data, historic records, and archaeological science to elucidate the ancient lives of the commoners that remain largely unexplored or silenced. Here we present preliminary bioarchaeological results focusing upon individuals interred in cist graves and larnaces. We here discuss biological data within their archaeological contexts in a first attempt to piece together the life histories of the Phaleron people. Overall, this project exemplifies the need to integrate biological data, material culture, historical narrative, and scientific methods by offering a synthesized approach to reconstruct life and death in Archaic Athens.",Edited volume (chapter submitted; under revisions),"Hoff, A., Prevedorou, E., Buikstra, J.

Establishing a system of classification has help clarify local building history.  Petrographic analysis correlates specific building sites with at least three island quarries.  The choice of construction stone was based on physical attributes and engineering properties. Limestones and dolomites with open cavities (vugs) were light weight yet strong and thus well suited for foundations, while basalt, trachyte, and rhyolite were mainly limited to the lowest level of foundations or large-scale polygonal retaining walls. The carbonates show varying degrees of post-installation weathering and degradation, most notably in the increased volume of cavities created by the plucking out of various sized pebbles.

19235,PW-263985-19,"The cultural heritage of medieval Sicily is extraordinary. Yet, although rich and diverse, it confronts numerous challenges that make it vulnerable and often inaccessible. Many of its medieval sites are unsigned. Others are very difficult to get to. And even others – ones that are more easily located – have erratic hours, essentially locking out the average visitor unless they are willing to invest the time and have the language skills necessary to persuade residents in the surrounding area to arrange access.   Inspired by these challenges, we are developing The Norman Sicily Project (NSP, http://normansicily.org) to document the cultural heritage of medieval Sicily during its Norman period (c. 1061-1194) so that a wider audience can learn about what was once there and what still remains. The site attempts to reconstruct what we know about the society by bringing together images, basic identifying information, geolocation data and, in some cases, videos, using modern web development techniques. For some sites, it also offers visualization tools that can help visitors understand the data in new ways. A genealogical resource - a force-directed graph - has also been developed to help viewers understand the kinship networks that the Norman rulers enjoyed with families across Europe. Blog posts by students working on the project as well as an online form that invites a broader community to participate in the project by submitting information that can be corroborated by the team's members have been developed to help foster a sense of community as well as to facilitate sharing by people who have relevant data, including Sicilians who have information stored locally in their cities and towns. The intention is that the project will offer scholars, students and the general public who are interested in Norman Sicily the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with each other while suggesting a web-based model for other medieval communities.",This volume will be available in print and electronic versions.,"Dawn Marie Hayes, Joseph Hayes","Mapping Pre-Modern Sicily: Maritime Violence, Cultural Exchange and Imagination in the Mediterranean","Emily Sohmer Tai, Kathryn Reyerson",,,,Palgrave Macmillan,,,"The Norman Sicily Project: An Ongoing, Web-Based Effort to Promote the Island's Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Past",2022

This chapter proposes that sociocultural practices provide important clues to a solution, and that linguistic differentiation across Amazonian groups is not so much a factor of isolation, but rather of interaction. Evidence includes the recurrence of regional ‘systems' across the Amazon basin, characterized by similarly essentializing views linking language and identity, and accompanied by restrained lexical borrowing and code-switching on the one hand, but convergence in grammar and discourse on the other. These phenomena may be grounded in the widespread view that social identity depends on the active maintenance of contrasts, including those relating to language.",subscription,Patience Epps,"Language Dispersal, Diversification, and Contact","Pieter Muysken, Mily Crevels",9780198723813,https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198723813.001.0001/oso-9780198723813-chapter-16,This URL leads directly to the book chapter,Oxford University Press,https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198723813.001.0001/oso-9780198723813,This URL leads to the book,Amazonian linguistic diversity and its sociocultural correlates,2020

We explore morphological proliferation in particular domains (nominal classification, tense, evidentiality, and valence-adjusting), and follow this with a more systematic exploration of morphological complexity in relation to wordhood status across a sample of eleven Amazonian languages. We argue that a large percentage of bound morphemes in these languages display ambiguity between morphotactic versus syntactic analyses, suggesting that morphological autonomy is best characterized as a matter of degree, and that different degrees of autonomy may apply on a regional scale. Since many accounts of word-internal morphological complexity implicitly rely on notions of autonomy, Amazonian languages invite a revision of our current conception of this domain.",subscription,"Patience Epps, Adam J.

19746,FEL-268510-20,"Ancient and medieval India (prior to ca. 1600) produced a vast literature dealing with the nature of the human being, the proper ordering of society, and ethical and legal norms. Sanskrit sources tend to emphasize special dignities belonging tof particular statuses according to a divinely ordained class hierarchy (var?a-dharma), but in some contexts we hear of universally shared aspects of the human condition. Ascetic and devotional movements found ways to call into question special dignities tied to ascriptive rank. Sanskrit texts on good governance and legal process formulate general standards of justice and equity that could cut across or by-passed rank. Thus, Hindu sources illustrate how ethical and legal orders find ways to compartmentalize: to recognize that all people can share basic capacities and aspirations does not automatically sweep the field clear of status dignity. This essay draws on Jeremy Waldron's concept of human dignity as a status claim that ""levels up"" by attributing to all people a dignity once reserved for a privileged few. We note Hindu examples of a similar approach, as well as examples of ""leveling down"" by pointing out the hypocrisy of elites while extolling the virtues of which the lowly are capable.","Not open access, but an open-access prepublication draft is available on SSRN.",Timothy Lubin,Human Dignity in Asia: Dialogue between Law and Culture,Jimmy Chia-Shin Hsu,9781108835749,https://books.google.com/books/about/Human Dignity in Asia.html?id=3YUkzAEACAAJ,Google books page.,Cambridge University Press,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract id=3682778,Open-access prepublication draft version.,Dignity and Status in Ancient and Medieval India,2022

20230,FA-251391-17,"Although thermal medicine originated as a result of ancient beliefs in the ability of water to transmit supernatural gifts from the divinity to humanity, by the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. the practice was already becoming both secularized and medicalized thanks to the rise of humoral medicine, which maintained that disease originated from imbalances in bodily fluids that mineral springs were uniquely positioned to restore.  Renaissance physicians took the humoral approach even further by studying the mineral properties of individual springs and prescribing treatments that targeted specific, individual conditions.  But despite the efforts of the early modern medical community to convince its patients that balneology was an empirical science, the uneven results of their prescriptions led many people to question the material simplicity of thermal cures.  If two people were affected with the same illness and followed the same external regimens, why was one person cured, while the other was not?  Did the person's state of mind play a role in the cure?  This paper will examine how beliefs about the power mind over matter evolved over the course of the 17th century through a comparison of the positions of Michel de Montaigne, René Descartes and Jean Racine on the curative mechanics of mineral springs.",,Allison Stedman,Enchantement et désillusion en France au XVIIe siècle,Michael Call,9783823385202,,,narr/francke/attempto,,,"“Mind over Matter: Mineral Springs and the Power of the Imagination in Seventeenth-Century France,”",2021

20236,FO-232742-16,"In this chapter I review the various meanings, practices, and theoretical investments of the term ""tenko"" across Japan's transwar history.  The term is best known through its interwar usage to signify the ""ideological conversion"" of hundreds of political activists and intellectuals, beginning with incarcerated Japanese Communist Party (JCP) members who publicly defected from the party in 1933-1934. It was then expanded later in the decade to encompass the experiences of leftist thinkers, academics as well as anti-colonial nationalists in colonial Korea who either abandoned political activism or began to proactively support the imperial state. Then, in the early postwar period, Japanese scholars returned to the question of tenko in order to pursue a variety of problems related to primarily Japanese intellectual history, including: theories of modern subjectivity, the paradigmatic shifts in modern Japanese intellectual history, the politics of writing, or, as revealing the constitutive dynamics of Japanese modernity or modernity more generally. I consider how we might construct a conceptual history of tenko that can account for all the diverse practices, political positions and theoretical investments the term accrued across the twentieth century.",,Max Ward,Tenko: Cultures of Political Conversion in Transwar Japan,"Irena Hayter, George Sipos and Mark Williams",9780367235796,,,Routledge,,,“Ideological Conversion as Historical Catachresis: Coming to Terms with Tenko”,2021

I pay special attention to what I think of as the Jewish moment in Nueve reinas, in which one of the con men identifies an elderly woman as Jewish and uses that knowledge to win her trust.

However, I generally write about Husserl's philosophy of logic and mathematics, which he repeatedly said had nothing to do with transcendental phenomenology. So, my aim here is to discuss some things that I believe people interested in constructivism and Husserl's transcendental phenomenology need to keep in mind. I say that, despite appearances, phenomenology was not everything for Husserl. As much as he loved it, he placed definite limits on what one should do with it and believed that it required an objective complement in the form of pure logic, that it had to be subject to a priori laws to keep phenomenologists from falling into psychologism, naturalism, empiricism, relativism and associated evils. According to this interpretation, Husserl the possible constructivist, Husserl the phenomenologist, Husserl the Platonist, Husserl the realist, Husserl the idealist were one and the same person from the late 1890s until his death, something which is particularly well expressed in the volumes of his lecture courses published since the 1980s, which shed considerable light on his thought.",,Claire Ortiz Hill,"Constructive Semantics, Meaning in Between Phenomenology and Constructivism",Christina Weiss,,,,"Springer Nature Switzerland, 2019,",,,"""Husserl's Purely Logical Chastity Belt,""",2019
20397,FA-251491-17,"This chapter examines how art and architecture actively manipulated how ancient Romans remembered and knew their world, sometimes even creating false memories of places, events, and institutions. It focuses on three case studies of objects and monuments from the Roman Empire: a sports souvenir from Roman Britain, travel souvenirs from the Bay of Naples, and the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome. Drawing on cognitive research into how external stimuli, including visual images, distort and falsify memories, the chapter demonstrates how these portable, private objects and monumental, public architecture all generated semantic memory of sites and activities around the Roman Empire. They may even have caused some Romans—and modern historians—to misremember certain historical events, such as the putative triumph in 202 CE of the emperor Septimius Severus. Cognitive theories such as the misinformation effect, the source monitoring framework, and the impact of conversation and collaboration on remembering illuminate how these objects and monuments—with their combinations of image and narrative—could shape semantic memories and create distorted and false memories through repeated viewing and use. Ultimately, the chapter argues that the souvenirs and triumphal arch projected manipulated semantic memories and false memories as a form of cultural and social connectivity, that is, a means of creating a shared cultural or historical narrative that could transcend time and space in the Roman Empire.",,Maggie L.

In June of that year, a fraction of the original armies of the First Crusade conquered Jerusalem and massacred the majority of its inhabitants.  The city's bloody conquest quickly came to stand for the entire First Crusade in medieval historiography; eyewitness narrators of the conquest creatively redeployed and combined scriptural passages as a way of endowing this momentous event with meaning, and later chroniclers continued this hermeneutical endeavor, mining the crusader capture of Jerusalem as they would a sacred text which might be interpreted along historical, moral, typological, and mystical lines.  On the typological level, the conquest of 1099 seemed to have been predicted by types in the Old and New Testaments, including the parting of the Red Sea and the dispersal of Christ's followers from Jerusalem, analogies which reflected widespread views of the crusaders as new Israelites or new apostles.  But the most insistent typological interpretation linked the 1099 conquest with the so-called ‘cleansing of the Temple,' when Christ drove the merchants and money-changers from the Temple in Jerusalem and afterward worked miracles of healing in the Temple precincts.",By purchase or institutional subscription,Katherine Allen Smith,The Uses of the Bible in Crusader Sources,Elizabeth Lapina and Nicholas Morton,978-90-04-3412,http://https://brill.com/view/title/26934,Publisher's website,Brill,,,The Crusader Conquest of Jerusalem and Christ’s Cleansing of the Temple,2017

In so doing, we draw upon recent work by Jacqueline Wernimont and Elizabeth Losh that uses the model of intra-action and distributed agency to explore how the method of production—be it print or digital—acts on, or produces, new modes of reading and new readers.

Much of the extensive literature on De anima II 5, and on Aristotle's theory perception quite generally, is at least tacitly animated by an interest in the difficulties we think stand in the way of making progress in the theory of perception: roughly put, difficulties of explaining intentionality and consciousness without falling into dualism. My main contention will be that Aristotle's own preoccupations, which he inherits from his predecessors, are rather different. The problem he thinks needs getting around does not have to do with how animals manage to represent the world at all (whether accurately or not), nor with how they manage to be aware of how they represent it as being, but rather with how they manage to discriminate correctly, and thereby successfully navigate, salient features of their environments.

This paper is about the nature of these objects: what about them makes them intelligible? My principal proposals will be that what makes them intelligible is that they are ‘separate' and ‘unmixed,' and that because, insofar as they are intelligible, they are, in their essence, ‘activity.' I am not unaware that this makes it sound as though Aristotle takes intelligibility to consist in some kind of nous. But he himself virtually says as much, when he claims that nous is the ‘form' of its objects (lit. e?d?? e?d??); besides it is a result he is committed to by the doctrines that nous is intelligible and that there is something that intelligible objects ‘all are in common'; for the alternative, as he himself says, is to suppose that nous ‘will have something mixed-in, which makes it intelligible just like the rest.' The challenge, then, is not to steer clear of this result, but to make sense of it.

20635,FT-60990-13,"In Chile's sweeping labour code of 1931, domestic servants were (among other workers) explic-itly excluded from a number of provisions, leaving them to rely on the state's social welfare office for medical care and minimal oversight of their labor relations. In the years following that exclusion – and throughout the popular fronts, 1938-1952 – female domestic workers regularly petitioned the Labour Office, demanding payment of salaries and severance, as well as an end to employer abuses. Based on these interactions and servant use of CSO clinics, numerous le-gal, social work, and religious professionals went on to write lengthy treatises describing the negative effects of household workers' exclusion from social legislation, advocating greater state protection. This paper draws on servant petitions, legal and social work studies, as well as newspaper, la-bour, and union records, to examine how female domestics and others understood their labour and their ""rights"": as workers, citizens, and mothers. The years of Chile's Popular Front re-gimes were critical years for the redefinition of ""empleada"" as a category in labour law and popular culture, which in turn contributed to the construction of myths of mestizaje and ""raza chilena"" that were so central to the chileanization project of Chile's populist regimes.",,Elizabeth Quay Hutchison,Towards a Global History of Domestic and Caregiving Workers,"Dirk Hoerder, Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk, Silke Neunsinger",978-90-04-2801,https://brill.com/view/title/26659,,Brill,,,"“The Problem of Domestic Service in Chile, 1924-1952""",2015

Our goal is to do more than provide the documents to the public.  We are developing tools to encourage creative use of the materials – lesson plans for middle-school students, guides for National History Day projects, and crowdsourcing tools to enable the public to participate in the project. We will continue to expand these offerings as more materials are published and hope to invite scholars, teachers, and students to contribute their analyses to the educational part of the site.  By making the data that underlies the edition accessible to digital humanities scholars, we will develop datasets that can be used by open source tools to analyze and interpret the papers. From maps that plot Addams's correspondence and associates, to social network visualizations and text analyses of her speeches and correspondence, the digital edition will encourage new questions and analysis that would not have been possible a short time ago.

20780,HAA-256102-17,"Recent targeted research analyzing these newspaper advertisements reveals that, to an extent heretofore unappreciated, enslaved people frequently utilized the sea as a viable route to escape bondage, especially from the coastal regions and ports of the Deep South. From the moment of colonization in North America through the beginning of the twentieth century, the use of waterways to establish and maintain commerce increased exponentially. With the rise of maritime commerce, ports expanded to accommodate growing demand. The increased frequency of imported and exported goods and services directly correlates with the rise of runaway slave advertisements that allude to the use of vessels or maritime routes in the suspected escape of fugitives. As fleeing individuals turned towards waterways to escape the bonds of slavery, slaveowners increasingly reflected their fears of fugitive egress by sea in their advertisements, warning the public to be vigilant in ports.  What follows, then, is not limited to a discussion of the value of runaway slave advertisements and the necessity of a centralized database, though they do speak to the larger inquiry at hand in this maritime Underground Railroad volume. Instead, this chapter emphasizes the ways that runaway slave advertisements inform discussions about North American slavery while focusing specifically on the prominence of maritime and other waterborne escapes. By deconstructing the advertisements and considering their basic elements, historians and future scholars can better understand the ways in which these advertisements illuminate aspects of slavery that intersect with theories of eco- nomics, culture, law, politics, race, and gender.",purchase,Jeffreys Megan,Sailing to Freedom:  Maritime Dimensions of the Underground Railroad,"Walker, Timothy",9781625345936,https://www.umasspress.com/9781625345929/sailing-to-freedom/,University of Massachusetts Press website listing for the book Sailing to Freedom:  Maritime Dimensions of the Underground Railroad.,University of Massachusetts Press,,,Freedom on the Move by Sea: Evidence of Maritime Escape Strategies in American Newspaper Runaway Slave Advertisements,2021

How do garments hold traces of the past and activate memories of the human experience? In which ways do clothing and adornment express sexualities?

In our course ""What is Memory?"" we read and write with Nabokov's life story using our own form of Gregory Ulmer's ‘mystory' mode of writing as a way to discover the life cycles of memories--ours and our students as well as those related by Nabokov--and to explore their tendencies to constellate around images, objects, and their metaphorical relations--the spiral, for instance. Following Ulmer, our mystory is modeled after Roland Barthes' A Lover's Discourse. Like A Lover's Discourse, it is based on a ‘tutor text': A Lover's Discourse's tutor text is Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther; ours is Nabokov's Speak, Memory. Like A Lover's Discourse, our Mystory consists of a collection of ‘figures,' short open-ended compositions in which we write with and after Nabokov, weaving our responses to the autobiography with our own and each other's memories, including autobiographical and collective memories as well as memories of other texts. This ‘weaving' process is supported by our use of Scalar (http://scalar.usc.edu/), a multi-modal web-authoring platform, as the environment for our collaborative work.

So he is referring to entities that are not material, i.e. that are not mutually interrelated and/or are formed by means of their internal activity upon themselves. Adopting this ""minimalist conception,"" Hegel thinks, changes how we see the way things are. He thus starts to speak about how all things strive toward some ultimate immateriality. This is the ""transformational conception of immateriality.""

Rather, as I argue, Hegel employs a circular or, as we may also call it, an organic transcendental approach to the study of mind. I show that his methodological approach is not a one-size-fits-all, mechanistic crank that churns out dialectic outputs from given inputs. Rather, it displays a surprising sensitivity to a study of the subject matter at hand: as Hegel himself avows at several points, the dialectic must allow a moment of passivity, whereby it conforms itself to meet the varying complexity of the objects of study.",in print and ebook,J.

20886,FS-261503-18,"This paper seeks a middle ground between two prevailing approaches to moral constraint in Hegel's philosophy:  the post-Kantian constructivism defended, for instance, in Pippin (2008) and the moral realism on offer, most prominently, in McDowell's various works (especially (1996)).  Briefly, the constructivist argues that moral values like freedom, right, and the good are distinctively human achievements that are, so to speak, ""made more than found."" The realist argues that moral values are ""there,"" or may be read off as moral situational facts by those who are properly attuned to them. Such beings, McDowell says, are open to a ""second nature,"" the reception of which contains moral valuations that are not, themselves, products of the spontaneity of thought. In this paper, I seek a moderate position between these two.

At the same time, the essayists analyze the cultures themselves, which included Euroamerican and African American vernacular oral, manuscript (journals and letters), and print (newspapers, magazines, or books) cultures; overlapping discourses of politics, protest, domesticity, and sentiment; unsettled literary nationalism and emergent literary regionalism; and vernacular and elite aesthetic traditions.",,Christopher Hager,Literary Cultures of the Civil War,Timothy Sweet,9-780-8203-496,http://https://ugapress.org/book/9780820357843/literary-cultures-of-the-civil-war/,,University of Georgia Press,,,“if we Ever Expect to be a Pepple: the Epistolary Culture of African American Soldiers”,2016

In beauty, humans experience a free lawfulness: a state in which we are guided by but not restricted to conceptual analysis.  In the sublime, we are reminded of the freedom that allows us to transcend even the fear of death.  Although Hegel's definition of freedom and his philosophy of art differ significantly from Kant's, the idea that art allows us to experience freedom is common to both philosophers.  Humans' understanding of freedom is pivotal to the emergence of artistic genres from the Egyptian sphinx to the romantic novel, according to Hegel; it also explains the joy we experience through painting and especially through poetry.

Until now, the field of animal history has paid little attention to the Civil War, and Civil War scholars have paid almost no attention to animals. This volume serves as an intersection of these two critical fields of scholarly inquiry. In thirteen essays, ten by Civil War historians and three by animal history scholars, the contributors illuminate an important but largely ignored aspect of the war-its animal participants. The topics covered are wide-ranging. One essay examines camels in the American South and Southwest before the war, highlighting the involvement of camels in illegal efforts to import slaves into the United States. Essays on horses during the war explore the process of procuring equines for military service, the training of horses for use by artillery units, and the impact of horse supply problems on hopes for Confederate military success. Two essays cover wildlife in the Civil War, focusing on bees. An essay on hogs in the Confederacy and another on the culture of meat-eating examine animals as food during the war. Two essays on dogs in the South during and after the war illustrate how pets and farm animals influenced slavery and the prosecution of the Confederate war effort. An essay on regimental animal mascots during the war analyzes how veterans incorporated them into their post-war lives. Another essay explores the effort to create a national zoo in the 1880s, a task that underscored the persistence of sectional division after Reconstruction. The final essay likewise examines sectional division and the resonance of enslavement as seen in the career of an ex-slave and his unusual show horse. Through the process of broadly writing animals into Civil War history, the contributors demonstrate the many ways in which animals of all kinds played roles in the sectional history of America during the middle and late nineteenth century.

Even though the books are set in the late eighteenth century, the character of Elizabeth Lavenza, in particular, is radically rewritten as an active, driving character in Oppel's series, a radical departure from Shelley's characterisation of Victor's betrothed and a reflection of a broader trend towards strong female characters in contemporary YA fiction.

Like the Girl on Fire, the Historical Bad Girl also appears to resist her society's conservative gender ideologies and binaries. an exceptional individual, she is intelligent, competitive, sexually desirable, and (in some cases) athletic. However liberating these portrayals may be, we argue that like the Girl on Fire, the Historical Bad Girl is capable of reproducing narratives associated with postfeminism, which holds that in a world where men and women compete on a level playing field, feminism is no longer necessary. In the sections to follow, we present a critical framework that we suggest teachers can use with students to support their investigating of whether Ya novels engage in or resist postfeminist and neoliberal discourse. We then apply our framework to a Ya neo–Victorian novel, This Dark Endeavor (2011), the first book in Kenneth Oppel's two- volume the apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein series. In doing so, our intention is to demonstrate how, by depicting the character of elizabeth Lavenza as a Historical Bad Girl, Oppel's novel inadvertently engages in narratives associated with postfeminism, despite actively trying to rewrite elizabeth as a strong, female lead for twentyfirst- century readers. although our focus in this essay is on the genre of Ya neo–Victorian novels, our framework is applicable to other genres of Ya literature, including realistic dystopian fiction. to conclude, we examine the implications of students' interrogating representations of Historical Bad Girls and Girls on Fire in Ya literature.",,Connors and Szwydky,Teaching Girls on Fire: Essays on Dystopian Young Adult Literature in the Classroom,Hentges and Connors,9781476679297,,,Macfarland,,,From Girls on Fire to Historical Bad Girls A Framework for Critiquing Postfeminism and Neoliberalism in YA Literature,2020

This capacity view is an externalist view that does not invoke reliability, remains steadfastly naturalistic, and in recognizing a metaphysically substantive common element between perception and hallucination avoids any commitment to disjunctivism. So it argues for a view of epistemic externalism that does not entail any version of epistemic disjunctivism. The basic idea of this capacity view is that in experience we employ perceptual capacities that function to discriminate and single out particulars in our environment. It is because a given subject is employing a perceptual capacity with a certain nature that her mental states have epistemic force. Employing such perceptual capacities yields a mental state that provides us with phenomenal evidence, and employing such capacities in the good case also provides us with knowledge-worthy factive evidence. In perceptual Gettier cases the subject only has phenomenal evidence and so lacks sufficient evidence for knowledge. This approach is distinctive in three respects: it groups perceptual Gettier cases in with hallucinations, it treats both via a lack of sufficient evidence (rather than through invoking some sort of fourth condition), and it divides up perceptual Gettier cases from fake barn cases and broken clock cases. The underlying picture of perceptual knowledge avoids the pitfalls of both externalist disjunctivist views and internalist views, while revealing what is right in both externalist and internalist approaches.

Sometimes it happens by reading a book, with the learner at home in a comfy chair in front of a fire. But sometimes - especially now, in the smartphone era - meaningful history-learning moments can occur just about anywhere. So, historians need to adapt. This chapter outlines how history-seeking audiences have always followed advances in communication technologies and how mobile technologies today simply offer opportunities for the next period of field expansion. The desirable affordances of smartphones can be traced conceptually back to the earliest people who read about historical events on papyrus scrolls (much more mobile than stone monuments), through volumes of bound papers cranked out on the printing press (prompting the need for mass literacy), and in complicated multimedia contexts (like with text and graphics overlaying video on television screens). As a confluence of the media that have come before it but also as a bridge to emerging forms of new media, mobile media are only now starting to be understood as viable media for history.

21773,RZ-255635-17,"The built environment delineates space for daily actions and important moments. Separating the occupants from the external world, walls can create barriers between the outside or can build communities within them. In archaeological literature, the term ‘house' often describes the architecture of settled peoples, painting visual images of sturdy stone structures dotting the landscape in perpetuity. In part, this image is constructed as the result of archaeological preservation; stone houses have longevity, with foundations and walls standing for thousands of years. In contrast, ephemeral and organic structures such as tents and brush huts are rarely preserved, and thus escape our conceptions of house and home in the past (Maher and Conkey, 2019). Issues of visibility are also intertwined with site function; what is visible archaeologically may be activity areas that do not relate to the domicile, which may be at a different location, and thus not identified in the archaeological record (Briz i Godino et al., 2013, Zubrow et al., 2010). This has led to a bias where mobile peoples are often forgotten in discussions of household archaeology, with a primacy placed on people who build permanent architecture. However, despite our modern biases, hunter-gatherers did (and do) have structures. Furthermore, as recently argued by Maher and Conkey (2019), these structures can convey a sense of ‘home', a concept usually reserved for sedentary people. Homes are where ‘life happens', where people interact with each other and with the objects in their lives. Not only are homes loci for ‘life', they themselves also live, undergoing changes, evolving with the inhabitants, and transitioning through rites of passage (Tringham, 1995). Recent excavations of two structures at Kharaneh IV, an Epipalaeolithic site in Eastern Jordan, provides a window into the lifeways of a hunter-gatherer community by reconstructing the life-history of the structures.",Book for purchase,"Danielle Macdonald, Lisa Maher",More Than Shelter from the Storm: Hunter-Gatherer Houses and the Built Environment,"Danielle Macdonald, Brian Andrews",,,,University of Florida Press,,,A Space for Living and Dying: The Life-History of Kharaneh IV Structures,2022

In the Azraq Basin of eastern Jordan, dramatic landscape changes from wetlands to desert resulted in major shifts in settlement and land use over time. Within the last few decades, several springs in the central Azraq Oasis have ceased to flow and the once-rich marshland is drying up, with devastating effects for local communities. Palaeoenvironmental research in the Azraq Basin suggests that, like today, water availability was a crucial factor for past populations. Changing environmental conditions throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene had significant impacts on human population movements and land use. Recent work at the site of Kharaneh IV (19.8–18.6 kya) indicates settlement of this intensively used aggregation site around the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26.5–19 kya) and abandonment by the start of a second drying period, Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 18–15.5 kya).",,"AJ White, Jordan Brown, Felicia De Pena, Christopher Ames",Palaeolandscapes in Archaeology: Lessons for the Past and Future,Michael Carson,9780367689032,,,Routledge,,,From Wetlands to Deserts: The Role of Water in the Prehistoric Occupation of Eastern Jordan,2021
21808,HAA-263850-19,"The application of new technologies to the study of cultural objects is inexorable, driven by intense human curiosity and the profound mysteries of the past. The long term diffusion of technology into cultural studies and the humanities has matured in this technical age, becoming much less invasive and remarkably precise, even revelatory. For example, one of the first non-medical applications of computed tomography (CT), achieved within two years of CT's commercial development in the 1970s,1 was the visualization of the internal structure of ancient Egyptian mummies. Similarly, conservation of and scholarship with manuscripts have become increasingly technology-oriented.2 With the advent of technical approaches that are more and more precise and at the same time less and less invasive, research is accelerating and diffusing into new fields, spawning novel techniques that reveal new information. The rapid technological advances over the last decade have led to exciting, innovative approaches to the study of cultural heritage objects. One of the most promising and increasingly used technologies is that of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Like medical CT scans, micro-CT is an ""X-ray transmission image technique""3 that combines the penetrating clarity of x-rays with the speed, precision, and accuracy of computers. While X-ray technology offers a two-dimensional glimpse through an object, micro-computed tomography generates a highly detailed 3D image of the entire internal structure of an object, revealing its inner features.4 Just as X-ray and computed tomography revolutionized medicine when they were discovered (the responsible scientists received Nobel prizes for their work, German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen in 1901 and Allan McLeod Cormack and Godrey Houndsfield jointly in 1979), today's micro-CT capabilities are similarly transforming the study of cultural heritage.",,"Paul C.

21958,RA-50039-06,"This is an essay about God who pretends to be a man who pretends to be other kinds of men. Impersonation involves a dialectic of power that both plays on binaries and often opposes them as well. This dialectic is often formed as a juxtaposition of the normative—the personation—and the nonnormative—the impersonation. Like all dialectics, impersonation registers friction and power differentials. Here public impersonation is taken to be premised on a differential of social power and simultaneously a demonstration of that differential. This performance of impersonation can have many impulses: the reassertion of dominance perhaps, but also an expression of protest or cultural critique. Impersonation can find motivation in anxieties about social mobility, but it can also convey empathy and confessions of social inequality. For these reasons, this paper will view public impersonation as a social didactic and public practice that often exposes the nature of social inequality, even if unintentionally. The focus here will be on practices that would be positioned within the ""social liberal"" context of demonstrating social inequality around caste as a means of critiquing that inequality rather than reinforcing it.",,Christian Novetzke,"Mimetic Desires: Impersonation and Guising Across South Asia,","Pamela Lothspeich, Harshita Mruthinti Kamath",9780824892777,https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/mimetic-desires-impersonation-and-guising-across-south-asia/,U Hawaii Press site,University of Hawaii Press,,,"Public Impersonators: Gender, Caste, and Social Ontology in the Marathi Vernacular Moment",2022

It attracted rich donations and special privileges from Late Republican generals such as Sulla — who sent a golden double axe to the goddess's temple, with an elaborate, self-aggrandizing dedication (Appian, Civil Wars 1.97) —  as well as from Roman emperors, above all Augustus, the first princeps (Smith 1993, 2-8).  By the Late Antique era, however, the city's association with the pagan goddess of love and beauty was no longer an advantage; rather, it was a problem in an increasingly Christian culture.  This paper examines the means by which the citizens of Aphrodisias eradicated the cult of Aphrodite, and in so doing transformed the visual landscape of their city.

The first phase of copying took place in the middle of the tenth century, when the Otho copy of the Old English version of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica was made; the second phase took place at the beginning of the eleventh century, between 1001–12, when additional materials were added to Otho from Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 173. These stages correspond to the reigns of Edmund I (939–46), Eadred (946–55), Eadwig (955–9) and Æthelred (978–1016). By looking closely at the contents and differences between the two manuscripts as they changed over time, it is argued that the scribes who expanded Otho did not, as Patrick Wormald suggested, ‘wide[n] the scope of the Corpus 173 argument'; rather, the scribes of Otho created an entirely new composite book that provides both a record of and a resource for Christian kingship.

How could projects of intellectual and cultural decolonization persist when anticolonial struggles in their armed and unarmed varieties had all but faded, and the revolutionary projects that formed in their wake have been eclipsed by internal strife, oppressive regimes, civil war, cooptation by former colonizers, and/or reactionary actors and discourses? What kind of theoretical and narratological arsenal does this moment demand to actualize its dual vision of a political future that is decolonized and of-its-time? This chapter reconstructs Laroui's Concepts Series as an expansive, multi-faceted and multi-layered response to a political-intellectual predicament encountered by Arab (and more generally, Global Southern) intellectuals in the 1980s and 1990s.  Published in five volumes over the course of sixteen years (1980-1996), the Concepts Series features five texts on Ideology (1980), Freedom (1981), The State (1981), History (1992) and Reason (1996). Diverse in their structure, narrative style, and prospective audience, these texts are retrospectively construed by Laroui as an extended examination of the central precepts of modern social and political thought ([1996] 2012, 14"". Beyond their internal variety, and their author's posited unity, I read these texts as featuring two thrusts: the first is to analytically and firmly distinguish between pre-modern Islamic and modern European notions and practices of each of these concepts, and the second to emphasize (and where possible, argue for) the philosophical depth of classical Islamic conceptions of these concepts and the integrity of modern Arab adaptations of post-Enlightenment European traditions of political thinking.",,Yasmeen Daifallah,Thinking Past Islam and the West: Theorizing the Political Subject in Contemporary Arab Thought,,,,,,,,Chapter 2: The Moment of Pedagogy: Cultivating Decolonized Subjectivity in Post-Revolutionary Time,2022
22436,FEL-273733-21,"This chapter examines Laroui's ground-breaking philosophical oeuvre in the 1960s and 1970s. While commentaries on Laroui's early work (and on his work more generally) often read it as an extended critique of modern Arab social and political thought, then celebrate or dismiss it for its unequivocal commitment to what Laroui terms ""modernity,""   my use of the lens of ""reforming reformers and preparing revolutionaries"" to interpret Laroui's early work unearths the political drive of his intervention and explores the way he actualizes that drive through conceptual and narratological devices. In deploying this prism, I attempt to read anticolonial texts as political interventions, not only in that they pitch a critique or chart a different political future, but in that they aim to undo the subjectivity they critique and produce that which they envision. I do this by dwelling on both what Laroui says and how he says it.Accordingly, my examination uses two registers. The first attends to the specifics of Laroui's argument, tracing its flow, defining, and situating its terms, and synthesizing its various parts into a narrative and theoretical arc. This register is significant not only because it is lacking in the existing literature, which tends to rehash CAI's arguments with a broad brush,  but also, and more importantly, because it renders legible and theoretically justifiable Laroui's diction, whose erudition and density often makes it obscure. In all, this register tries to get as close as possible, and stay as faithful as possible, to the substance of Laroui's argument and its overarching objectives (both explicit and implicit). If the first register tracks the twists, turns, and broad arches of Laroui's argument, the second register features my interpretation of what Laroui is doing. Here, I reconstruct the theoretical toolkit that Laroui uses but rarely announces, and carefully trace its workings and effects. It is also here that I closely follow Laroui's",,Yasmeen Daifallah,,,,,,,,,Chapter 1: The Moment of Critique: (Re)forming the Revolutionary Subject in Postcolonial Time,2021
22469,FEL-273163-21,"This critical edition presents the trilingual glossary in London, British Library, Manuscript Harley 219, a newly discovered text compiled and produced by Thomas Hoccleve (c. 1367-1426). Harley 219 contains four major literary texts and a glossary that were copied or corrected by Hoccleve in conjunction with fellow scribes at the Royal Office of the Privy Seal. A final, practical text added in the hand of a later Privy Seal clerk indicates that the volume remained in the hands of Hoccleve's colleagues after his death. There are modern editions of most of the literary texts: Odo of Cheriton's Fables, the Anglo-Latin Gesta Romanorum, Christine de Pizan's Epistre Othea, and a French Secretum Secretorum (and, indeed, Harley 219 has been consulted in some of them). However, the trilingual glossary has largely been overlooked until its connection to Hoccleve became apparent: it is a wordlist of French terms glossed in Latin, and less frequently, Middle English, and followed by a very short series of phrases in French and Middle English. This trilingual production offers evidence of how Hoccleve and fellow clerks approached French language and language learning, and it contains playful linguistic arrangements and at least one reference to Hoccleve's poetic works that are essential for understanding his audience and their engagement with French beyond their professional capacities as clerks. Throughout the introduction and notes of my edition, I argue that the glossary uniquely combines a variety of sources and demonstrates Hoccleve's own innovations in glossary structure and experimental language. The introduction contextualises the work within several relevant contexts from broad to narrow: late medieval glossaries and language-learning texts, Hoccleve's clerical career at the Royal Office of the Privy Seal, and the French and Latin works within the same codex.",subscription,"Misty Schieberle, ed., transl., and introduction","Hoccleve’s Trilingual Glossary: A Critical Edition from London, British Library, Harley Manuscript 219","Jane Taylor, series editor",,,,"Medium Aevum Monograph Series, to be published 2024",,,Introduction,2021

Through the lens of her memoir, this paper explores women's roles in war. It examines Imam as a nationalist in the unfolding political ferment and the continuing negotiations she undertakes with respect to Bengali nationalism in East Pakistan. Despite her staggering losses, Imam had a stake in nationalism, and her motherhood, as powerful as she feels it, does not obviate that. Finally, the paper asks whether a biological category like ""motherhood"" is relevant to the analyses and understanding of social phenomena such as war.",open access through Taylor &amp; Francis,Debali Mookerjea-Leonard,Muslim Women’s Writing from across South and Southeast Asia,"Doaa Omran, Feroza Jussawalla",9781032163215,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003248064-15/mother-war-debali-mookerjea-leonard,Taylor &amp; Francis website,Routledge,https://www.routledge.com/Muslim-Womens-Writing-from-across-South-and-Southeast-Asia/Jussawalla-Omran/p/book/9781032163215,publisher web site,A Mother in a War: Jahanara Imam’s Memoir Ekattorer Dinguli,2022
