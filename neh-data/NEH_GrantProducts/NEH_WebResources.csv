626,ED-50241-03,"This project grew out of a desire to attain a deeper understanding of the complex multicultural phenomenon that is Latin music. Born in West and Central Africa, raised in Haiti, Cuba, Brazil and New Orleans, and attaining its full bloom in New York, Latin music is truly a global phenomenon that embraces two centuries, three continents and innumerable cultural traditions.  Today, salsa and Latin jazz are played and enjoyed all over the world by musicians and dancers of all ethnic origins. Until recently, full-length studies on this subject were scarce. In the past ten years, research on the origins and development of jazz yielded information and renewed interest on the parallel, intertwined development of its close cousin, Latin music.  Since 1999, seminal studies have been published by John Storm Roberts, Robin Moore, Isabelle Leymarie, Lise Waxer, Leonardo Acosta, and Raúl Fernández. A traveling bilingual exhibition on Latin Jazz: The Perfect Combination, sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, opened in Washington D.C. in 2003 and will circle the nation for the next three years.  A generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities enabled Professors Ana María Hernández, Max Rodríguez and Gustavo Moretto to form a study group under the direction of consultant Edgardo Díaz-Díaz to delve into recent publications on the subject and listen to CD reissues of sources long unavailable. While the grant project resulted in a series of instructional modules to be used in three specific courses, we felt the need to extend our findings to a larger public.","Edgardo Diaz-Diaz, Ana Maria Hernandez, Max Rodriguez, Gustavo Moretto",http://faculty.lagcc.cuny.edu/ahernandez/afroots,"This website traces the influence of African music on the development of Latin, primarily Caribbean, music from the arrival of the fist slaves to the plantations of the Caribbean to recent forms of musical fusion.

2496,RZ-50924-08,"Grotta Scaloria, or Scaloria Cave, was discovered in 1931. A rock fall had closed the entrance to the cave for thousands of years. Excavations for an aqueduct in 1931revealed a fissure in the ground which was actually a break in the ceiling of the cave. Exploration of the cave revealed burials, Early Neolithic pottery, flint tools, polished stone tools, and many bones. A short study was conducted in 1936, but World War II intervened, and stopped exploration of the cave by all except a few tombaroli, or tomb robbers. Scaloria Cave was rediscovered by several young speleologists in 1967. Beginning that year, faculty and students from the University of Genoa, led by Professor Santo Tinè, along with the speleologists and members of the Apulian Antiquities Department, undertook several limited explorations and reported their findings at national and international conferences. This inspired the late Marija Gimbutas, Professor of European Archaeology at UCLA, to join her Italian colleague Professor Tinè in the project ""The Neolithic of South-East Italy,"" jointly sponsored by UCLA and the University of Genoa. They conducted two excavation seasons in 1978 and 1979, along with a 1980 study season that took place in the National Archaeological Museum in nearby Manfredonia, on the Adriatic, where many of the materials from Tinè's earlier explorations of the Cave and those from the joint excavations are stored. Scaloria was ""lost"" again as the scholars then moved in different directions. Professor Gimbutas died in 1994 but during her last weeks asked, or rather insisted, that Dr. Ernestine Elster, also of UCLA, promise to see that the Scaloria Cave material was published.

Over the span of three summers, teams of researchers conducted oral history interviews with more than one thousand elderly black southerners who remembered that period of legal segregation. The audio-cassette tapes and selected transcripts of the 1,260 interviews in this collection capture the vivid personalities, poignant personal stories, and behind-the-scenes decision-making that bring to life the African American experience in the South during the late-19th to mid-20th century.

Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Duke University.&#x0D; 410 of the 1,260 interviews have been digitized and made available on this site totaling about 725 hours of recorded audio. 165 of the interviews include transcripts comprising more than 15,000 pages of text. &#x0D; 310 of the interviews in the digital collection were conducted with North Carolina residents.

3742,HD-50228-07,"http://edillo4.wix.com/equiano-gis#!essay&#x0D; &#x0D; The Atlantic World is a spatial concept.  Literally, the Atlantic is an ocean, and in recent years, historians and literary scholars have increasingly called upon this ocean to define the field of study in which they work.  Scholars who might once have worked in the areas of early American literature or British imperial history have traded a politically and nationally delimited field for a spatially and geographically defined one.  There are many good reasons for this development, not least of which is the challenge and excitement of constructing a field imaginary in which the nation-state does not (for those who work in pre-national American contexts, for instance) anachronistically organize the canon of meaningful works and the shape of intellectual inquiry.  And indeed, the Atlantic world is a term that seems to catch at the lived reality of the many people, goods, ideas, biota, and texts that circulated between and among Europe, Africa, and the Americas in the period of European colonization of the Americas, as well as in later periodsperiods that may, in turn, be productively viewed in terms of the neo-imperial and/or postcolonial national cultures accreted on the bones of this (Atlantic) colonial history.  But what are the ramifications of turning to a spatial term to define a field of history and literature?  More broadly, we might ask, what is the relation of Atlantic space to the humanities work being performed under the rubric of its title?",Elizabeth Maddock Dillon,http://edillo4.wix.com/equiano-gis#!essay,,,,"A Sea of Texts: The Atlantic World, Spatial Mapping, and Equiano's Narative",2008

3822,HD-50176-07,"One of the essential approaches in preservation of architectural heritage is documentation of 3D geometries and surface textures of historical buildings. However, precise colour information, irrespective of lighting effects, which is an intrinsic property of the surface materials of building interiors and exteriors, has not been accurately documented in the scale of whole building surfaces, except for small sample areas. Every day the materials of historical buildings are decaying and their colours are fading. The goal of this project is to develop a method to assist in recording and documenting the intrinsic chromaticity information of building interiors and exteriors of architectural heritage with low cost and high efficiency. The method takes advantage of the emerging High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDRI) technology, which can store rich information about colour and illumination through digital photography. The significance of this research lies in that by recording the colour information, in addition to the geometry and texture information that can be obtained through other technologies, we can achieve more complete documentation for architectural heritage.

The hypothesis behind this study, which mines and visualizes Love's Martyr's authorial boundaries using the NEH-funded Lexos suite and other stylometric applications, is that portions of text attributed to Chester within Love's Martyr indicate stylistically significant departures from work signed by him here and in manuscript.

What ""accidents"" of history made human impact in the Selway-Bitterroot so low? How did the rigors of the land itself aid in the preservation process? Answering such questions is vital to an understanding not only of the Selway-Bitterroot, but also of wilderness areas more broadly, at a time when U.S. citizens throughout the country struggle with the question of how best to interact with and manage wild lands, which arguably, are among our most important national resources.

Printed in 1500, this mural-sized woodcut portrays a bird's eye view of the city that was instantly recognized as a technological and artistic masterpiece, a portrait of an urban marvel. No other city view rivaled its grandeur, ambition, or detail. With staggering precision, the View of Venice visually describes the dense fabric of the city—thousands of buildings, hundreds of bridges, and a complex network of islands, canals, narrow streets, squares, and wellheads. The original print was on loan from the Minneapolis Institute of Art for this exhibition. For the first time, this exhibition animated the View of Venice with interactive displays that told stories of one of the wealthiest, most powerful and greatly admired cities in the early modern world. Touchscreens revealed the production of this extraordinary print as well as the historical and social themes that emerge from the image: the celebrated uniqueness of Venice, detailed city views, women and men, the state, religious life, collections and lost treasures. An augmented reality highlights the stunning continuities and remarkable transformations to the city in the more than 500 years following the View's publication in Venice.

13949,FA-252261-17,"In 1838 Thomas Mulledy, S.J. signed his name to an agreement selling the 275 enslaved persons who resided on Jesuit-owned estates in Southern Maryland to Louisiana. The sale served as the culmination of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus's fraught experience with slaveholding in the colonial and early national period. While much historical work has been written on Jesuit slaveholding, that writing has primarily focused on the implications for the religious community and the moral universe in which these men made their decisions about slavery. Thus far, however, no scholar has studied the enslaved people themselves.  This project focuses on the lives and experiences of the enslaved, rather than on their Jesuit owners. Focusing on the enslaved community itself makes this project ideally suited for digital methods. With an eye to the events and relationships that formed the warp and woof of the daily lives of this enslaved community, Sharon Leon has identified the individual enslaved people present in the documentary evidence beginning in the 1740s and situated them within their families and larger community. The source base for this work consists of a number of collections related to the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, which are housed at the Booth Family Center for Special Collections at Georgetown University. Many of the key documents are available through the Georgetown Slavery Archive.  In processing and representing this archival research, the project employs linked open data and social network analysis to assess the entire community of enslaved people and their relationships to one another across space and time. This approach allows for both a focus on the distinct individuality of each enslaved person and the ability to pull back to grasp the community in aggregate, noting trends and changes in their experiences and relationships during their time in Maryland.",Sharon M.

North Carolina is home to the fourth largest Hmong population in the United States. Hmong, a sub-ethnic group from Southeast Asia have lived in the United States since 1975, as refugees of the Vietnam War. Identifying the need to recognize and include this population as a part of the local history of Catawba County, the Catawba County Library in partnership with the Historical Association of Catawba County, applied for and received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to complete a preservation endeavor, known as Hmong Keeb Kwm — ""keeb kwm"" being the Hmong word that embodies history, tradition, and culture.  During the spring and summer of 2018, five collection events took place at the Catawba County Library branches and at True Life Alliance Church, a local Hmong assembly. There was an all-call for Hmong community members to bring their traditional artifacts, immigration documents, letters, photographs, and share their personal oral histories to be recorded. Collaborations were established with local Hmong organizations, such as Hmong Southeast Puavpheej, which helped in the success of the project. Culturally enriching programming such as a performing arts showcase, a panel discussion, and book discussions took place at the library. Through Hmong Keeb Kwm artifacts were collected from 16 participants, yielding over 145 digitized items, and 14 oral history recordings.

Once baptized, Africans and their descendants were eligible for the sacraments of Christian marriage and burial, adding to their historical record. Through membership in the Catholic Church families also generated a host of other religious documentation such as confirmations, petitions to wed, wills, and even annulments.

The 25 different books that have been chosen since the program's inception can be thought of as probes into the reading behavior of the city. The dependent variables of interest are, of course, the patterns of reading behavior that these probes elicit.

All four felt that the deal reached with government was unacceptable and stole money and control of the reservation's water from the Crow people. There is no River Crow perspective given in the interviews. That said, many discussed the factionalism of the period and that it had ramifications politically to this day on the reservation by normalizing this behavior.  Big Horn River Case- These interviews were with individuals who worked in some capacity in the federal case that took control of the Big Horn River away from the Crows at its conclusion in the US Supreme Court. Some participated in protests, while others worked on legal briefings during the case.

16202,PW-253678-17,"PEN (originally P.E.N., an acronym for Poets, Essayists, and Novelists) is an international writers' organization with member centers present in over 100 countries worldwide. Founded in London in 1921 by Catharine Amy Dawson Scott, PEN began as a simple dinner club, meant to bring writers together to socialize and share ideas. Within a few years, the organization grew to include centers throughout Europe, and by the 1930s included centers in Asia and South America. PEN remains one of the top international writers' organizations in the world and its members continue to champion the organization's ideals: celebrating literature, defending free expression, protecting writers at risk, supporting writers in exile, and promoting linguistic rights around the globe. The PEN Records, 1912-2008 (bulk 1926-1997), occupy 362 boxes (153 linear feet) documenting the history and activities of the English PEN Centre and PEN International, as well as the formation (and sometimes dissolution) of other PEN centers around the globe. The PEN Digital Collection contains 3,500 images of newsletters, minutes, reports, scrapbooks, and ephemera selected from the PEN Records. To further enhance research, the English PEN newsletters (1927-1964) and minutes (1931-1970) have undergone OCR conversion to create full-text searchable documents, enabling users to locate names, events, and topics in their original chronological contexts and use that information much like an index into the rest of the archive.",Harry Ransom Center,https://cdm15878.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll97/,,https://cdm15878.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll97/search,,PEN Digital Collections,2019

In the course of tackling these challenges, the project has not only developed an open-access digital edition of GW's, but also laid the groundwork for a Drupal for Editors prototype.

16518,RZ-249862-16,"The associations between America and Asia that dominated the geographical and cultural imagination of Europe for two centuries after 1492 pose a fundamental conceptual challenge, making it necessary to suspend the definition of the words ""America"" and ""Asia"" and imagine an early modern ""Amerasia."" Even when it became common to separate the continents on maps, themes of Amerasian thinking remained in place. This web portal aims to bring the Amerasian worldview back to life for contemporary readers.  In 1545, the German mathematician and cartographer Caspar Vopel (1511-1561) designed a famous and influential map of the world that spectacularly embodies the Amerasian worldview. Vopel's original is now lost, and we know it through a reprint made by Venetian printer Giovanni Andrea Vavassore in 1558, a large-scale, woodblock-printed wall map in twelve sheets entitled A New Complete and Universal Description of the Whole World According to the Modern German Tradition.  Although well known in its time, today a single copy of the Vopel/Vavassore map survives in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Using an interactive, high-definition interface, this website explores the map's content—its toponyms, cartouches, figurative images, and textual descriptions—amplifying the map through a wide-ranging explanatory apparatus. Pink pins offer short entries about locations on the map, blue pins indicate translated cartouches, and yellow pins offer more extended essays pegged to sites and inscriptions with particular Amerasian significance.  In the spirit of the National Endowment for the Humanities Collaborative Fellowship that supported its creation, we present this online platform for the Vopel map as an invitation to collaborative scholarship. We invite additional entries on toponyms or themes relevant to the Amerasia problem, hoping that this new digital tool encourages an accelerated and dynamic scholarly exchange.","Louisa M.

16591,PY-258644-18,"The Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association (1988) case made headlines in national and international arenas as several California Indian tribes were protesting the building of a road between Gasquet and Orleans in Northern California. The sacred spaces, geological and ecological formations and the ongoing practice of traditional ceremonies in the High Country were of little concern to the Forest Service. They had already built paved sections in the region and now all they needed to connect Gasquet to Orleans was to pave the six mile section which ran through the High Country. While the case culminated in the 1987 Supreme Court arguments, it had been fought for many years before through grassroots organizing and lower court cases which had all sided with Native tribes and upheld an injunction that stopped the building of the road.   Students at Humboldt State University have been working with Native American Studies Professors Dr. Cutcha Risling Baldy (Hupa, Karuk, Yurok, enrolled Hoopa Valley Tribe); Dr. Kayla Begay (Hoopa Valley Tribe); and Special Collections Librarian Carly Marino to document and create an online archive of materials about the G-O Road.

The archive features documents like letters from Ceremonial Leaders, written by hand, that ask for protection of the High Country. It also features a journal kept by Karuk artist and activist Julian Lang, who participated in the protests and fight against the G-O Road. In one of his journal sketches he wrote: ""Protect Indian Religion. NO-GO. Fix the Earth. NEVER SAY I'M NOTHING. If you fix the Earth you ARE somebody! Stop the Gasquet-Orleans Road in Northern California.

What makes a person able to perform heroic acts? Is this something that certain people are just born with, or does it grow out of our circumstances and upbringing? Related to this is the essential question of how much control we actually have over our own self-making. Major thinkers have debated these questions for centuries, and individuals continue to grapple with them as they face down the challenges — sometimes seemingly small, other times impossibly large — of everyday life.   The books in this series each take a different view of what it means to be a hero, considering how the combination of unique social circumstances, compassion for others, and inner resources can make it possible for young people to perform acts that they may not have imagined themselves capable of achieving.",Maria Sachiko Cecire,http://www.ala.org/tools/programming/greatstories/resources/hero,This page provides access to all materials needed to promote and implement a GSC reading and discussion series on the Heroism theme.,,,"What Makes a Hero?

17738,GW-259303-18,"Empathy has been held up as a balm for our divided society by everyone from neuroscientists to primatologists to political thinkers. Yet as the consensus grows that we need to cultivate more empathy, the scarcer it seems to become. From political debates, to cultural choices, to classroom conversations, we seem increasingly unable to engage in empathetic exchange. Instead, we pick sides and dig in against perceived enemies.  Recent studies have made the case that literature is perhaps our greatest resource for developing empathy; as authors push us to inhabit the lives of their characters, we find ourselves a little less likely to retreat behind the walls of our own moral certainty. 2 The books chosen for this series complicate that equation: each text encourages readers to explore the power of empathy, but also helps us understand why empathy can be so hard to come by. Each text invites the readers to, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, ""slip ... into another's skin, another's voice, another's soul."" They also confront readers with the dangers of feeling — and acting on — another's pain.",Anna Mae Duane,http://www.ala.org/tools/programming/greatstories/resources/empathy,This page provides access to all materials needed to promote and implement a GSC reading and discussion series on the Empathy theme.,,,Empathy: The Cost of Switching Sides - MATERIALS FOR LIBRARIES,2018
17739,GW-259303-18,"Growing from a child to a teenager to a young adult usually involves a number of rites of passage. From bar and bat mitzvahs, sweet sixteen parties, and quinceñeras, to getting a driver's license, attending prom, and graduating from high school, there are any number of formal and often public rituals that mark the steady journey from childhood to adulthood. While these events vary from culture to culture, they usually include educational milestones, parties that celebrate maturity, and special responsibilities that reflect newfound trust from one's community. These moments can be both scary and exciting.  However, many formative moments for young people happen in more informal settings. Everything from dating to dealing with family or society at large all provide opportunities for challenge and growth. And the truth is that young people are not navigating these public and private moments in a vacuum. Indeed, young people are sometimes figuring out their morals, values, and increasing independence while living in societies that do not always value their newfound voices. This circumstance is drawn into particularly sharp relief for young people in historically marginalized groups. Not only do they have to figure out all the ""normal"" stuff that comes with growing up, they have to do so with the added burden of negative social pressure. The books in this series emphasize the role of discovering one's own power, exploring how protagonists find out who they are and what they stand for. They also emphasize fighting the powers that be, often by banding together with other scared, but brave, folks who are not only willing to fight for themselves but for the good of the greater society. Finally, they explore the consequences of bravery, illustrating how young people's choices can have an impact on themselves and the world around them.",Susana Morris,http://www.ala.org/tools/programming/greatstories/resources/brave,This page provides access to all materials needed to promote and implement a GSC reading and discussion series on the Bravery theme.,,,Growing Up Brave: Courage and Coming of Age - MATERIALS FOR LIBRARIES,2019

Obama's line is a slightly altered version of a quote from Southern author William Faulkner; in other words, he turned to literature as a source of wisdom about the difficult subject of race in America, and built upon what he found there to imagine new pathways towards justice, healing, and unity.  The ""Deeper Than Our Skins"" theme is grounded in literature that can help us look beneath the surface of racism in America to reveal how the past is alive in the present. This theme uses powerful stories of oppression, resistance, suffering, and triumph to identify the roots of racialized experience in the United States, and to inspire discussions around how to construct more equitable futures for the people in our nation and world.",Maria Sachiko Cecire,http://www.ala.org/tools/programming/greatstories/resources/skins,This page provides access to all materials needed to promote and implement a GSC reading and discussion series on the Deeper Than Our Skins theme.,,,Deeper Than Our Skins - MATERIALS FOR LIBRARIES,2019
17741,GW-259303-18,"The old adage goes ""children should be seen and not heard."" That conventional wisdom implies that speaking up and out is the exclusive realm of adults. It also suggests that children and young people don't have important things to say — that they should stay out of adult conversation.  The truth is that young people have been vital to making change by speaking and showing up in the face of adversity. Take Joan of Arc, for example. In 1429, while just 18 years old, she led a French army to the besieged city of Orléans in a victory over the English.   But we don't have to go back to 15th-century France to find young heroes. On November 14, 1960, 6-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first African American child to integrate a white Southern elementary school. Her mother and U.S. marshals had to escort young Ruby to class because of violent mobs in her hometown of New Orleans. Bridges was born the same year that Brown v. Board of Education made ""separate but equal"" public spaces illegal, and her bravery was a milestone in the Civil Rights movement.

Though income inequality has remained a significant problem in the United States, Sesame Street remains steadfast in providing equal educational opportunities for children.  As the audience for Sesame Street has grown, the show has used its characters to embody the values of multiculturalism and diversity. The show has incorporated characters with autism, HIV, and physical disabilities to provide children with relatable examples of people different from themselves. They have also embraced different cultures, languages, races, and ethnicities, giving children opportunities to see themselves in the lives of puppets. As a result, Sesame Street has become a global phenomenon with variations of the show existing in countries across the world.  This lesson focuses on the history of Sesame Street and its value in promoting diversity and multiculturalism. Using a segment about Rosita, a longstanding bilingual character, students will examine how the show explores issues of identity and diversity.",Diana Williams,https://www.backstoryradio.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/03/The-History-of-Sesame-Street-in-America-and-the-World-Lesson-Set.pdf,"""Sunny Days: The History of Sesame Street in America and the World"" Lesson Set",,,"""Sunny Days: The History of Sesame Street in America and the World"" Lesson Set",2019

17781,TR-259293-18,"From 1948 to the early 1990s, South Africa used an institutional policy of segregation known as apartheid to marginalize the nonwhite population. Though whites were a minority group in South Africa, apartheid allowed them to exert control over the government, economy, and society. Apartheid faced opposition from the global community including the United Nations especially in the 1970s and 1980s. Social movements within South Africa intensified during this time as well, even as prominent black leaders like Nelson Mandela were imprisoned.  The United States government shifted its stance on South Africa throughout the 20th century. During much of the Cold War, the U.S. prioritized maintaining friendly alliances with anticommunist regimes over the fight for global equality. In competing with the Soviet Union, the U.S. also relied upon valuable minerals exported by the segregationist South African government. There were clear racial elements to U.S. policy as well, as many politicians were in favor of a continuation of domestic Jim Crow era laws promoting a segregated society.  This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, focus on the evolving history of relations between the U.S. and South Africa.

The photograph, from his time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, showed a person wearing blackface standing next to another person wearing a Ku Klux Klan uniform. The ensuing fallout from this revelation brought blackface and its presence throughout US history back to the forefront of American discourse. This lesson focuses on the enduring history of blackface in American culture. It emerged as a byproduct of minstrel shows following the American Civil War. Used as a form of mockery and vehicle for promoting racial stereotypes, minstrelsy was one of the most popular forms of entertainmentinthelate19th century. Thisunfortunatelegacycontinuedintothe20th century.Thoughtherearecountless examples of blackface used in various forms of entertainment, the Backstory episode highlights the legacy of blackface in the Mummers Parade. This Philadelphia New Year's Day tradition is one of the oldest folk festivals in the United States. It also has a history of explicit racial overtones and blackface. This legacy was challenged during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, leading to a conflict between African American groups and event participants. Though blackface was officially outlawed from the event in 1964, examples of racism, sexism, and bigotry have endured. Though the history of the Mummers Parade has an undeniable connection to blackface and racial stereotypes, thousands of people look forward to watching and participating in this annual tradition.

This singular moment was the culmination of a decade of extensive efforts by the U.S. government and the scientific community.

Fifty years after the fact, the moon landing is still celebrated as one of the greatest achievements in human history. However, this era is also often treated with an uncritical nostalgia. For many Americans, the Apollo 11 mission represents a moment of unity at a calamitous time in American history. For other Americans, the ""space race"" was a distraction from the fight for civil rights and the intractable conflict in Vietnam.

Built with data from manuscripts held at National Records of Scotland (NRS), this is the first project to ever comprehensively chart the growth, movement, and networks of the Scottish clergy following the Reformation in 1560. For scholars and students of this era, such a resource provides crucial framing for inquiries into religious beliefs, political conflicts, and institutional change. For those interested in family history on both sides of the Atlantic, MSR offers unprecedented information on individuals whose outsized archival footprints make them critical figures for genealogical research.  This project started in 2017 with the Project Team's Directors Michelle D. Brock (W&amp;L University) and Chris R. Langley (Newman University). This website reflects the findings of Stage 1 of the project, which focused on the diverse and important presbyteries in the Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. This stage was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Strathmartine Trust and supported by our wonderful Advisory Board and other generous collaborators. This pilot user interface was designed in collaboration with Hristo Meshinski, Stewart Cromar, and Ewan McAndrew of the University of Edinburgh.

Intuitively, we believe that he conceptual relationships discovered by text mining algorithms among texts in large, heterogeneous collections can fruitfully inform and guide traditional close-reading approaches. More fundamentally, our contention is that scholarly reading in the digital age—and the true usefulness of computational analysis of texts—should be foregrounded on the discovery and navigation of intertextual relationships. The model we have developed here allows users to navigate between individual and larger groups of texts that are related through shared themes, ideas, and passages. What the Intertextual Hub offers, then, along with the scalable reading tools, is an approach to federating collections that can bypass the various competing problems of quality (OCR vs. curated) and access (pay vs. public) inherent in digital collections today, and still yield meaningful results.",Robert Morrissey,https://intertextual-hub.org/,,,,The Intertextual Hub: Search and Navigation across Digital Collections,2021

To highlight the global connections of the American Revolution, the Museum commissioned modern makers to create 14 large handmade flags replicating those that were flown by Revolutionary-era privateers and navy ships at sea.  The Museum debuted the flags on Flag Day Weekend in conjunction with Flags and Founding Documents, 1776-Today, which features more than 40 rare American flags alongside historic documents.    Onsite visitors interacted with the makers who recreated these early flags from countries like the United States, France, Britain, Spain, Portugal, and more, including handling the flags, trying their hand at sewing, and learning about historic textile work. Online visitors were able to follow the project's progress and take a closer look behind the scenes through the Museum's social media channels.  An activity guide for families was created for True Colours highlighting flags in the Museum's collection and flags on loan for the special exhibition, explaining how flags have been used as symbols for communication, and featuring fun activities.

20109,GG-271459-20,"Between 1775 and 1850, most of the colonies in the Western Hemisphere declared and successfully won their independence from the European monarchies of Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, and France. This era of European and American history is generally thought to begin with the Revolutionary War to found the United States of America and end with number of European efforts for democratic reforms in 1848, and is often referred to as the ""Age of Revolutions."" In the American colonies formerly held by Spain and Portugal - what we now refer to as Latin America - colonists claimed independence in a series of military and political struggles between 1808 and 1825. White elites of Spanish descent in the colonies protested the demands and constraints of the imperial states, particularly the taxes and other economic burdens imposed by the colonial powers on their colonies, and the lack of opportunities in colonial administration. These complaints converged with ideas of Enlightenment thinkers about freedom, progress, and representative government, and the examples of the revolutions in the United States, France, and Haiti, to form independence movements. They also resonated with many members of oppressed and marginalized populations, including enslaved people, people of color, the Indigenous, the poor, and almost all women - many of whom joined the struggles for independence. By 1836, the former Latin American colonies of Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Bolivia had gained independence from Spain; Brazil from Portugal; and Uruguay from Brazil. That year, Spain formally renounced all claims to these lands. Cuba and Puerto Rico would remain Spanish colonies until the Spanish-American War of 1898; in the Dominican Republic, the fight for independence from Spain and from Haiti continued into the 1860s.",Will Hansen,https://dcc.newberry.org/?p=18337,Digital Collection for the Classroom: Latin American Independence in the Age of Revolutions,,,Digital Collection for the Classroom: Latin American Independence in the Age of Revolutions,2021

20306,AH-274706-20,"During the economic hard times of the 1930s, U.S. government art projects under the WPA (Works Progress Administration) and other agencies created a wealth of public art and supported art communities across the country. These projects had an enormous impact on American art and artists, but much of that history, particularly in the Northwest, where hundreds of artists were employed and thousands of artworks were created, has been unexplored. Organized by the Tacoma Art Museum, Forgotten Stories: Northwest Public Art of the 1930s offers an extensive overview of the bounty of work created in our region and brings forgotten treasures back to view.   From December 1933 to June 1943, the federal government sponsored a unique set of projects to support artists and create public artworks. The United States was suffering under a severe economic depression and millions were unemployed. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration created the New Deal—a host of programs designed to provide government jobs, from construction to office work. Through the advocacy of Eleanor Roosevelt and others, jobs for artists, musicians, actors, and writers were included.  The art projects abruptly ended when the U.S. entered World War II and many of the artworks and related records were lost or destroyed. Little was thought to have happened in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington (the government's Region 16). However, research now shows over 600 artists were employed, more than two thousand objects created, and hundreds of thousands of Northwest residents experienced or created their own original artworks. Forgotten Stories celebrates this important moment for public art in our region.","Margaret Bullock, curator",https://willamette.edu/arts/hfma/exhibitions/library/2020-21/forgotten-stories.html,Forgotten Stories exhibition main page,https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=s6eqRUSNNeS,"Forgotten Stories virtual tour, made possible through 2020 NEH CARES funding.",Forgotten Stories: Northwest Public Art In The 1930s (Virtual Tour),2020

Unlike much of the historical material currently available on the Internet, this edition is a completely vetted, historically accurate digital version of her writings and speeches that conform to established standards, both in terms of technical features of its encoding, and providing accurate renderings of the texts. It provides open access to complete versions of those articles, speeches and statements, most frequently cited and those that are often inaccessible to general readers. In this digital edition, the Project seeks to make these documents much more accessible to researchers.  In a collection where there is so much material on a handful of subjects, readers may search documents by a date ranges, publication source, and type of document (speech, draft article, etc.), as well as by simple word. While such searches often return too many matches, they are invaluable for a researcher who wants to see each instance of Sanger's use of a word or term. A reader could search for the word ""abortion"" and go through each of them to get a sense of her views. However, in such a search will pick up not just discussions of abortion, but mere use of the word. In many instances Sanger simply said that birth control would reduce the frequency of abortions. To solve the problem of getting too many, often not relevant ""hits"" the Project has prepared a subject index. In the above example, this index will help generate fewer, but more relevant results.","Esther Katz and Cathy Hajo, editors",http://m-sanger.org/digi,Digital edition web page,https://sanger.hosting.nyu.edu/documents/electroniced/,Project web page,The Speeches and Articles of Margaret Sanger,2021

They barely scratch the surface of how any one town looked - let alone what life there might have been like.

That collection features more than 50 iconic AP images that made and changed history—and won four Pulitzers. These photos transformed Americans' understanding of soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict.    DuMA expanded that experience to a citywide series of programs that ask, ""How do we tell the truth in war?""  Alongside the AP photographs, visitors will explore artifacts carried by U.S. soldiers into battle. That installation—of a local collection—is inspired by Tim O'Brien's acclaimed book, The Things They Carried. Newly recorded oral histories bring local veterans' memories to life for the first time publicly—a collaboration by the Veterans Freedom Center, University of Dubuque, DuMA and the Grout Museum. Concurrent DuMA exhibitions include reporting of the Vietnam War by local journalists Bob Woodward Jr. and Jim Geladas and photos by Ron Testa, an official Navy combat photographer. MercyONE has created special museum resources about brain health and the effects of Agent Orange.  Vietnam: The Real War is made possible in part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities with support from the Dubuque Racing Association (DRA), Cottingham &amp; Butler, the City of Dubuque's Arts and Culture Special Projects funds and Humanities Iowa.

This is the first large-scale program to embrace our new mission:  We create engaging art experiences that excite, inspire, and connect our community. Two core goals are at the heart of this mission:  1) Connect our community. We strengthen the fabric of our  community by sparking connections across generations,  backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives.  2) Create engaging art experiences. We build these connections through active learning, making, and experimenting. Vietnam: The Real War offers a singular experience out of multiple perspectives that can be encountered in our galleries, online, and around town. Inside the Falb Family Gallery, you'll see iconic images  by the photojournalists who documented and changed history as part of The Associated Press's Saigon bureau.

Part of a 2019 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Office of Digital Humanities (ODH), DHRI's curriculum, which was originally developed for in-person workshops, was revised in Summer 2020 to better meet the needs of virtual instruction due to the covid-19 pandemic. While the curriculum has always been available openly on GitHub, this site creates a more user-friendly and functional interface that is open and free for public use.  The DHRI curriculum focuses on technical skills and concepts upon which additional technologies and tools rely. We call these foundational skills. Approximately one-third of all workshops at the Institute could be described as foundational: they introduce concepts such as the command line, version control &amp; data collaboration, data literacy, and an introduction to programming with Python. The materials and workshops on this site are designed for users who are either unfamiliar with technology or could simply benefit from filling in gaps in their knowledge. Workshops and tutorials here encourage the use of open source technologies making them accessible to the widest possible audiences. We believe our emphasis on foundational skills demonstrates our commitment to empowering humanities researchers to become confident self-teachers and mentors in their own right who can make informed decisions about their research materials and methods that will lead to successful, sustainable, and long-term research goals.

This project investigates and digitizes an archive of Quaker documents to reveal new perspectives on early feminist and abolitionist thought, while also confronting systemic racism in archival studies and the digital humanities through a collaboration between a large public research university, a public teaching-intensive university, and an HBCU: the University of California, Santa Barbara; California State University, Northridge; and Howard University. The project focuses on the Ballitore Collection, an archive of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Quaker correspondence and journals held at UCSB's Special Research Collections. This unique, virtually unknown collection sheds light on the intersection of gender, race, class, and religion in the period, a turbulent moment in which British and American abolitionists were pushing to end the slave trade. The primary author is Mary Leadbeater (1758-1826), an Anglo-Irish poet and essayist and central figure in Quaker circles. Quakers were key players in abolition despite their small numbers and secondary political status, and they also exhibited proto-feminist tendencies with their emphasis on female preaching. But the collection also reflects many structural hierarchies, as its contents were assembled by a middle-class white woman and the Black voices in the collection are filtered through a white framework—from that of Leadbeater, who first compiled the documents, to that of its twentieth-century archivization and dissemination. The collection opens onto a host of identities from the eighteenth-century British Empire and early United States to today.  To find new ways of surfacing these competing perspectives, Hidden Archives applies computational techniques to a manuscript archival collection. We are using two primary techniques: topic modeling and network analysis. Topic modeling is a method that breaks documents and collections into lists",Rachael S King,https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/rachaelsking/corresponding-with-quakers,,,,Corresponding with Quakers,2022

22910,BH-272357-20,"The government-led process that came to be known as ""Indian Removal"" occurred over a period of many years and involved numerous tribes of Native people. Georgians were singularly aggressive in their resolve to remove their Native populations, primarily Muscogee and Cherokee, and had secured what they believed was a firm promise from the U.S. government to do so when they surrendered the part of their claimed territory in 1802 which eventually became the states of Alabama and Mississippi. These long-simmering tensions finally came to a boil with the election of populist U.S. President Andrew Jackson in 1828, leading to the Indian Removal Act and the eventual forced removal of tribes in the Southeast. This series of events later came to be known as the Trail of Tears, and for the Cherokee Nation it dealt a devastating challenge to their long struggle to maintain sovereignty in their Appalachian homeland. The Trail of Tears is now a federally recognized National Historic Trail administered by the National Park Service, covering over 5,045 miles across nine states, interpreting what has long been recognized as a pivotal event in the history of our nation. This driving tour focuses on the military round-up that occurred in the spring of 1838 in Northwest Georgia. This tour, developed by the Funk Heritage Center with funding from the Georgia Humanities and in partnership with the Georgia chapter of the Trail of Tears Association and an NEH Landmarks teacher workshop, will give you a better understanding of the circumstances leading up to the Cherokee Removal, the initial round-up of the Cherokee by government troops, and the effect of these horrifying events on the Cherokee who lived in present-day Georgia. While some of the stops on this tour have only a historic marker to indicate the events that happened there, others are fully-developed interpretive sites and museums that grapple with the effects of the Trail of Tears historically, individually, and collectively.","W.

Barack Obama used these words in 2008 to argue that we can only truly understand—and begin to overcome— the bitterness of modern race relations through a brave and accurate accounting of history. Obama's line borrows from one that appears in a book by Southern author William Faulkner.

Similarly, the ""Deeper Than Our Skins"" theme is grounded in literature that can help us look beneath the surface of racism in America to reveal how the past is alive in the present.

From the initial period of independence of the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom from the Seleucid empire under Diodotus I in the mid-third century BCE to the final Indo-Greek rulers at the beginning of the first century CE, coins provide the best, and in many cases, only evidence of the sovereigns under whom they were produced. Given the lack of other sources, much about the history of this period is uncertain and BIGR aims to make clear the limits of our knowledge, for example, by avoiding mint attributions and specific dates.  BIGR is organized using a new typology of Bactrian and Indo-Greek coins, created by Gunnar Dumke and Simon Glenn, published first here. The current version will soon link to coins in the major collections of the American Numismatic Society, Ashmolean Museum, Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Münzkabinett of the State Museum of Berlin, British Museum, and the Fitzwilliam Museum. A print volume with commentary on the BIGR typology and other aspects of the coinages, published by the American Numismatic Society, will follow in 2024. Funding for the project, a joint initiative between the American Numismatic Society and the Ashmolean Museum and Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents at the University of Oxford, was provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council.

23531,FT-270278-20,"This StoryMap aims to offer an accessible introduction to the complicated issues at hand in debates about what kinds of living arrangements are ideal for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It is a companion project to my book in progress, On the Spectrum: Refugees from Nazi Austria and the Politics of Disability and Belonging in the UK and US. I focus on the Camphill movement, an international network of residential communities were people and with and without disabilities live together in extended-family style households and work together on the land and in the crafts. Disabled community members are cared for by their non-disabled household members, most of whom choose not to earn an income. Rather than paying them wages, the community provides for their housing, food, and other needs. Camphill's first community was founded in Scotland in 1939 by refugee physicians from Nazi Austria. They had been trained in Curative Education at the University of Vienna Medical School, one of the research centers from which the autism diagnosis emerged. Today, there are about 140 Camphill and Camphill-inspired communities in Europe, North America, and a few other places around the world. Camphill is championed by some disability self-advocates, allies, and scholars—including Temple Grandin—and strongly criticized by others, which makes it a useful example through which to unpack debates not only about housing, but about disability inclusion and belonging more broadly.   I created this project for three reasons: First, to investigate whether there was a spatial dimension to Camphill's history that would generate insights I might otherwise have missed (there was). Second, to share visual material—images and interactive maps—that are difficult or impossible to include in traditional publications. And third, to communicate the complexity of a fraught topic accessibly, to a broad audience.",Katherine Sorrels,http://https://arcg.is/0CrCeH0,,,,Disability and Belonging: Camphill and the Debate over Independent Living for People with Intellectual Disabilities,2022

23569,PW-253797-17,"In the years following the publication of the first and second editions of Leaves of Grass, Walt Whitman began compiling a scrapbook. It's unclear what purpose he had in creating the massive document, comprised of portions of textbooks, magazines, newspaper clippings, and manuscript notes—more than 1,000 individual text surfaces in total—all relating, in some way, to world history and geography. Whitman in these years was both searching for ways to extend the vision he had laid out in the first two editions of Leaves, and also working and drafting in a variety of other genres. What we do know is that, in the late 1850s, as the nation appeared more and more in danger of fracturing, Whitman created a document that, between two hardbound covers, brought the whole world together, a laborious and sprawling act of union—and a document that contained the seeds of several works that found their way into print in the following years, including a number of poems in the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass.  Although scholars have been aware of this scrapbook, it has received scant attention, in part because it is housed in a relatively small collection of Whitman materials (the Bayley / Whitman Collection at Ohio Wesleyan University), and in part because of the daunting size of the artifact itself. With the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the assistance of Special Collections staff at Ohio Wesleyan University Libraries, the Walt Whitman Archive has digitized the scrapbook in its current state. Our transcription includes all material relevant to the scrapbook's theme and surfaces marked by Whitman; we have omitted transcriptions of unrelated printed verso material and printed text formatting such as italics and underlining, and have included in brackets descriptions of charts, tables, and figures for ease of searching.","Matt Cohen, Caterina Bernardini, Kevin McMullen, Ashlyn Stewart, Caitlin Henry",https://whitmanarchive.org/manuscripts/marginalia/index-scrapbook.html,Whitman Archive Website,,,Whitman's Cultural Geography Scrapbook,2020

24267,RZ-279848-21,"Our project website contains biographical essays, interpretive essays, and (eventually) demographic data visualizations as well as access to a searchable database for users who wish to query our dataset for their own research.   Sharing Stories from 1977 captures the history of the 1977 National Women's Conference, the only federally funded, bipartisan supported, and most diverse gathering of American women in U.S. history. This conference was held as the U.S. corollary to the United Nations International Women's Year initiative after the first World Conference on Women in Mexico City. Today, it stands out for the comprehensive National Plan of Action passed by delegates, addressing issues that speak to our own times from LGBTQ rights to childcare.  Our ambition is to present all the stories of all conference attendees by the NWC's fiftieth anniversary in 2027. In addition to the almost 2,000 elected national delegates, we also want to include the 150,000 plus participants in lead up state and territorial meetings. Finally, we are incorporating the thousands more staff, volunteers, onsite observers, international dignitaries, presidentially-appointed commissioners, journalists, and three First Ladies. We also plan to track the impact of the NWC in two important ways: by tracing the legislative outcomes of the 26 policy areas outlined in The Spirit of Houston report and by examining the imprint the NWC left on advocacy networks and political careers. We are finding, through initial research, that not only were Americans more civically engaged in the 1970s than scholars assume, ""being there"" in Houston was a significant catalyst in many people's lives.","Elizabeth A.

What role did religion play in people's mobility? Help us transcribe Quaker letters to understand how their authors' social and religious networks shaped their movements. PRINT is a collaborative digital humanities project that traces the communication networks of early modern European religious minorities (Anabaptists, Quakers and Pietists) and the ways they shaped the dynamic patterns of migration in the Atlantic world. Housed at the University of Central Florida, PRINT is creating a digital repository of letters and tools for visualizing the complex connections the correspondence reveals. We seek to understand the links that arose in response to religious persecution and missionary work and the way those connections influenced migration flows.
