		<Abstract>The exhibition Echoes of the Past—co-organized by the University of Chicago's Smart Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery— draws upon the findings of a multiyear research project headed by Katherine R. Tsiang at the University of Chicago's Center for the Arts of East Asia. Using such twenty-first-century technologies as 3-D scanning, Tsiang and an international team of technicians and scholars have identified many of the dispersed sculptures from Xiangtangshan in an effort to shed new light on the original beauty and meaning of the cave temples. This exhibition catalog features entries with full-color illustrations of the works in the exhibition as well as six new essays discussing the artistic, historical, and religious significance of the caves and their sculptures and recent research dedicated to their digital reconstruction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Charles "Teenie" Harris (1908-1998) photographed the events and daily life of African Americans for the Pittsburgh Courier, one of the nation's most influential Black newspapers. From the 1930s to 1970s, Harris created a richly detailed record of public personalities, historic events, and the lives of average people. In 2001, Carnegie Museum of Art purchased Harris's archive of nearly 80,000 photographic negatives, few of which are titled and dated; the archive is considered one of the most important documentations of 20th-century African American life (www.cmoa.org/teenie). The book will serve as the definitive publication on the life and work of Teenie Harris, consisting of three significant essays: Cheryl Finley, assistant professor in the history of art at Cornell University, offers the first thorough analysis of Harris as an artist, situating him within the history of 20th?century African American art as well as American documentary and vernacular photography; Larry Glasco, associate professor of history at the University of Pittsburgh, draws on new research to present a detailed biography of the photographer; and Joe Trotter, professor of history and social justice at Carnegie Mellon University, explores the social and historical context of Harris's photographs. The book will also include a foreword by Deborah Willis, professor at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. In addition to comparative illustrations within the essays, the book includes 100 plates of Harris's signature work and a complete bibliography and chronology"</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent scholarship demonstrates that a confederacy of city-states in southern Mexico, largely dominated by Nahua, Mixtec, and Zapotec nobility, successfully resisted both Aztec and Spanish subjugation. Children of the Plumed Serpent explores the extraordinary wonders in fresco, codices, polychrome ceramics, gold, turquoise, shell, textiles, featherwork and other precious materials that were produced by these confederacies between AD 1200 and 1500, as their influence spread throughout Mesoamerica by means of vast networks of trade and exchange. A ruling class of nobles, or caciques, believing that Quetzalcoatl, the human incarnation of the Plumed Serpent, had founded their royal lineages, called themselves the "Children of the Plumed Serpent"; they resurrected themselves and continued to affect cultural development in Mesoamerica during a dramatic period of social transformation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The offering of Gifts - state, religious and personal - is a practice nearly as ancient and widespread as human culture itself. At courts throughout the Islamic world, the exchange of lavish gifts intimately linked art with diplomacy, religion and personal relationship. This beautifully illustrated book explorer the complex interplay between artistic production and gift-based patronage by discussing works of great aesthetic refinement that were either commissioned or repurposed as gifts. By following the unique histories of certain artworks, Komaroff reveals how t he exchange of luxury objects was central to the circulation, emulation and assimilation of artistic forms both within and beyond the Islamic world. She adds a new dimension to the understanding of Islamic art and culture from the eighth to the fifteenth century.0Exhibition: Museum of Islamic Art, Doha (19.3.2012-2.6.2012).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An eminent ancestor of the better-known Inca, the Wari ascended to power in the south-central highlands of Peru in about AD 600, underwent a brief period of incandescently explosive growth, and then, by AD 1000, collapsed. Elite arts and the ideologies that informed them were among the Wari's most prominent exports. From their capital, one of the largest archaeological sites in South America, they sent their religion along with elaborate objects and textiles out to highland provincial centers hundreds of miles to the north and south, and down into populous Pacific coastal areas to the west. The arts were crucial to the Wari's political, economic, and religious communications: like other ancient Andean peoples, they did not write. The objects featured here cover the full range of Wari arts: elaborate textiles, which probably were at the core of their value systems; sophisticated ceramics of various styles; exquisite personal ornaments made of gold, silver, shell, or bone and often inlaid with precious materials; carved wood containers; and other works in stone and fiber. 200+ color illustrations</Abstract>

Through approximately 160 paintings, sculptures, prints, textiles, and decorative art objects, this exhibition presents for the first time American, European, and Asian luxury goods from everyday life as signifiers of the faith, wealth, taste, and socio-racial standing of their consumers. The exhibition explores themes including representations of the indigenous and Creole elite, rituals in the home, the sala de estrado (women's sitting room), the bedchamber, and social identity through material culture." --Brooklyn Museum website.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nothing matches the energy of Opening Day: a celebration of spring time, renewed dreams, and of national heroes past, present, and future. From the game's earliest days in the nineteenth century through today, baseball has served as a pathway for minority groups to learn and understand American values.  As a complement to the groundbreaking exhibition Chasing Dreams: Baseball and Becoming American, the National Museum of American Jewish History (NMAJH) has published a 256-page hardbound volume of the same name featuring over 40 evocative, compelling, and touching essays by a notable array of authors, sportswriters, former players, and commentators, as well as 143 stunning photographs chronicling the history of the game.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Italian Americans reveals the unique and distinctive qualities of one immigrant group's experience, and how these qualities, over time, have shaped and challenged America. At the turn of the 20th century, many Italians immigrants came to work, earn money to support their families, and eventually return home. Nearly half of the first generation Italian immigrants did return to Italy, but for those that made America home, their struggle to maintain a distinct Italian culture was guided by remarkably powerful ideals of family that had always been at the center of their lives.   While the power of the Italian family became a source of strength, it also bred suspicion, popularized in popular media as a dark, criminal element. This clash of culture echoed through generations of Italian Americans as they entered positions of political, social, and cultural influence.   Through extensive archival materials and interviews with scholars and notable Italian Americans such as Tony Bennett, Nancy Pelosi, Gay Talese and John Turturro, The Italian Americans tells the story of those who played vital roles in helping to shape a unique Italian American identity and to transform American life and culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Called "America's playground," Coney Island is a world-famous resort and national cultural symbol that has inspired music, literature, and films. This groundbreaking book is the first to look at the site's enduring status as inspiration for artists throughout the ages, from its inception as an elite seaside resort in the mid-19th century, to its evolution into an entertainment mecca for the masses, with the eventual closing of its iconic amusement park, Astroland, in 2008 after decades of urban decline. How artists chose to portray Coney Island between 1861 and 2008--in tableaux of wonder and menace, hope and despair, dreams and nightmares--mirrored the aspirations and disappointments of the era. This dazzling catalogue highlights more than 200 images from Coney Island's history, including paintings, drawings, photographs, prints, posters, film stills, architectural artifacts, and carousel animals. An extraordinary array of artists is represented, from George Bellows, William Merritt Chase, Reginald Marsh, and Joseph Stella to Diane Arbus, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Robert Frank, Red Grooms, Weegee, and Swoon. Essays by prominent scholars analyze Coney Island through its imagery and ephemera as both a place and an idea--one that reflected the collective soul of the nation." -- Publisher's description.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thomas Hart Benton was a thoroughly American artist. His regionally focused paintings and murals depicted everyday American life as well as the country's history. This volume focuses on one of Benton's most American associations: Hollywood. Not only did Benton create commissioned murals and portraits of film stars and movies, but he also developed a style that was highly cinematic. This volume is the first to collect all the works conceived by Benton for the film industry. It includes ephemera, photographs, and documents of Benton at work, along with a series of thought-provoking essays that explore a diverse array of topics—from Benton's engagement with American identity, to parallels between his use of Old Master methods and film production techniques. Fans of Thomas Hart Benton will find surprising insights into his career, while those fascinated by Hollywood history will discover how one of America's most revered artists shaped and was in turn influenced by the film industry. The exhibition American Epics: Thomas Hart Benton and Hollywood will be on view June 6, 2015 to September 7, 2015.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Already frequently used to represent authors in antiquity, portrait busts became the most familiar and widely disseminated images celebrating famous writers during the eighteenth century. No literary figure was more esteemed than the poet Alexander Pope, and his sculpted portraits exemplify the celebration of literary fame at a period when authorship was being newly conceived, and the portrait bust was enjoying new popularity. This exhibition explored the convergence between authorship, portraiture, and the sculpted image in particular by bringing together a wide range of works that foregrounded Pope's celebrity status.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Made in the Americas reveals the largely overlooked history of the profound influence of Asia on the arts of the colonial Americas. Beginning in the sixteenth century, European outposts in the New World, especially those in New Spain, became a major nexus of the Asia export trade. Craftsmen from Canada to Peru, inspired by the sophisticated designs and advanced techniques of these imported goods, combined Asian styles with local traditions to produce unparalleled furniture, silverwork, textiles, ceramics, lacquer, painting, and architectural ornaments.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Among the exquisite objects featured in this book, from across the hemisphere and spanning the seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries, are folding screens made in Mexico, in imitation of imported Japanese and Chinese screens; blue-and-white talavera ceramics copied from Chinese porcelains; luxuriously woven textiles, made to replicate fine silks and cottons from China and India; devotional statues that adapt Buddhist gods into Christian saints; and japanned furniture produced in colonial Boston that simulates Asian lacquer finishes. The stories these objects tell, compellingly related by leading scholars, bring to life the rich cultural interchange and the spectacular arts of the first global age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As an enduring wellspring of creativity for many artists throughout history, dance has provided a visual language to express such themes as the bonds of community, the allure of the exotic, and the pleasures of the body. This exhibition catalogue is the first major investigation of the visual arts related to American dance, offering an unprecedented, interdisciplinary overview of dance-inspired works from 1830 to 1960 and accompanies Dance! American Art 1830-1960, a multimedia exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts from March 20 to June 12, 2016. The Dance! American Art 1830-1960 exhibition features more than 90 of America's most spectacular works of art alongside filmic representations that explain and celebrate dance as central to American life and culture. Works are from the Detroit Institute of Arts and other leading American and international museums as well as from private collections. The DIA's exhibition brings together the greatest nineteenth-century American artists including John Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer, and Mary Cassatt; spotlights the superstars of the Harlem Renaissance including Aaron Douglas, William Johnson, and James Van Der Zee and features the artists who shaped the aesthetics of modern dance including Isamu Noguchi, Jasper Johns, and Andy Warhol.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the years between World War I and World War II Paris was at the center of the art&amp;#x0D; world. Indeed, the very essence of twentieth-century art history stems from the movements and&amp;#x0D; avant-garde experiments that emerged there in the early years of the century. Mexican artist Angel Zárraga was one of the few Latin American artists who opted to make Paris his permanent home, however, only returning to Mexico under duress at the onset of World War II. Because of the intensified artistic activity in Mexico after the Revolution, Mexican artists often made only short sojourns to Paris, while their contemporaries from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Chile flooded Parisian arts academies and salons between the wars. Since Mexico had become a locus for experimental and socially motivated artistic activity, Zárraga's decision to stay in Paris puts him at odds with many of his compatriots. Moreover, Zárraga chose not to construct an identity for himself as a Mexican artist in Paris, and his sole association with Mexican cultural initiatives was his commission for the murals at the Mexican Legation, where he asserted quite overtly the cultural hegemony of France. He did not associate with the newly formed circles of Latin American artists in the city or participate in their exhibitions such as the Exposition d'Art Américain-Latin at the Musée Galliera in 1924 or Joaquín Torres-García's Première exposition du groupe latino-americain de Paris at the Galerie Zak in 1930; rather he preferred to distance himself from groups defined by cultural identity and instead align his work with the subjects and styles of European modernism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An exhibition on Jews and medicine presented us with an ideal opportunity to apply a historical perspective to illuminate how scientific and cultural concerns have intertwined to shape not only the American Jewish experience, but an important field of human endeavor. Moreover, because our museum is based in Baltimore and surrounded by world-renowned hospitals and medical schools that are at the forefront of medical innovation, the topic offered a chance to connect with our community's heritage and to draw on our rich collection of materials dealing with the local experience of Jews in medicine.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; While packed with information and insights, the Beyond Chicken Soup exhibit necessarily leaves out a great deal. To extend our investigation, this catalog features essays by four distinguished authors who delve more deeply into the exhibit's themes. In the opening essay, "Strangers and Healers: The Jewish Immigrant Body and Healthcare's Role in the American Assimilation Experience," Alan Kraut examines how medicine served as a vehicle for assimilation and acculturation for American Jews. Kraut contends that the campaign to encourage Jewish immigrants to adapt a healthy and fit lifestyle, based on American standards, was a response to antisemitic characterizations of the Jewish body as diseased and weak.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The MLA archives catalog is a digital catalog inventorying its collection. Currently, the catalog consists of one records group, MLA Records, the largest group in the archives. It holds paper records generated by the Modern Language Association (MLA), 1896–present. Records primarily include correspondence, memoranda, and similar documents related to administration of the association. Some personal correspondence between executive directors, presidents, staff, and members is included. Early association history is missing from the collection. This is likely due to the association's lack of an official headquarters until 1928.  The focus of this cataloging project is the General Chronological Collection (GCC), which was one of the largest collections in the archives and remains the most topically diverse. As of 29 January all cataloged materials were once stored in the GCC. Those that were misfiled in the collection, due to previous labeling as "miscellaneous," mislabeling, misfiling, or lack of a label were pulled from the GCC and arranged in their proper collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How West African gold and trade across the Sahara were central to the medieval world  The Sahara Desert was a thriving crossroads of exchange for West Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe in the medieval period. Fueling this exchange was West African gold, prized for its purity and used for minting currencies and adorning luxury objects such as jewelry, textiles, and religious objects. Caravans made the arduous journey by camel southward across the Sahara carrying goods for trade—glass vessels and beads, glazed ceramics, copper, books, and foodstuffs, including salt, which was obtained in the middle of the desert. Northward, the journey brought not only gold but also ivory, animal hides and leatherwork, spices, and captives from West Africa forced into slavery.  Caravans of Gold, Fragments in Time draws on the latest archaeological discoveries and art historical research to construct a compelling look at medieval trans-Saharan exchange and its legacy. Contributors from diverse disciplines present case studies that form a rich portrayal of a distant time. Topics include descriptions of key medieval cities around the Sahara; networks of exchange that contributed to the circulation of gold, copper, and ivory and their associated art forms; and medieval glass bead production in West Africa's forest region. The volume also reflects on Morocco's Gnawa material culture, associated with descendants of West African slaves, and movements of people across the Sahara today.  Featuring a wealth of color images, this fascinating book demonstrates how the rootedness of place, culture, and tradition is closely tied to the circulation of people, objects, and ideas. These "fragments in time" offer irrefutable evidence of the key role that Africa played in medieval history and promote a new understanding of the past and the present.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The catalog locates Nepal's artistic heritage in the larger Himalayan and Indic culture zones and in a variety of mediums highlight its extraordinary artistic religious traditions. It brings special awareness to the unparalleled contributions of Newar artisans and patrons not only to the subsequent development of the Himalayan art but also to Indian art and the diaspora of Buddhist art across Asia. As an interdisciplinary project, the "Dharma and Pu?ya…" exhibition catalog underscores the contributions of people – patrons, donors, ritual specialists, or devotees –  in creating and amplifying the efficacy of the artistic productions that are instrumental in expressing religious devotion and recording traditional ritual observances.  To this end, ritual objects will be juxtaposed with what may be collected in the West as "fine art objects" like scroll paintings, painted manuscripts, wooden carvings, repoussé icons, or gilded images. The Nepalese "paubhas" (the term for hanging paintings on cloth in Nepal) and manuscripts  are also frequently accompanied by colophons containing historical records of initial donations and subsequent ritual use. To date, no systematic attempt has been made to address the living traditions of Buddhist Devotionalism that underlie them. Sixty objects drawn from eight museums and two private collections will be displayed in the exhibition along with wooden carvings and a paubha painting commissioned for the exhibition from local artists in Kathmandu.  The catalog  explains each object in detail and will be an important forum to extend its impact to the larger scholarly community.  The exhibition is divided into four parts: Section  I. Ritual (Chapters 1 &amp;amp; 2); Section II. Text and Images (Chapters 3 &amp;amp; 4); Section III. Kathmandu Valley Context (Chapters 5 &amp;amp; 6);  and Section 4: Artistic Practices (Chapter 7 &amp;amp; Notes from the field). There are seven scholarly essays and two short notes from the field.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>This exhibition highlights Nepal’s artistic heritage as a rich and enduring continuation of Indic Buddhist traditions. Featuring paintings, illustrated texts, sculptures, and ritual implements crafted by Newar artisans over the last millennium, “Dharma and Pu?ya: Buddhist Ritual Art of Nepal” will be centered on how the Buddha’s teachings were arrayed as much for worldly householders as otherworldly seekers. As the title suggests, it will illustrate the centrality of ritual in Buddhism, showing how illustrated narratives and common practices address every devotee’s need to make good karma (pu?ya), a central tenet of the Buddha’s teaching (dharma). Showing some objects never before displayed in the West, this historic exhibition will focus on the unparalleled contributions of Kathmandu Valley artisans and patrons not only in their communities, but in the subsequent development of Tibetan art.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>With a focus on the visual, literary, performative and creative practices of veterans, the National Veterans Art Museum Triennial explores a century of war and survival while challenging the perception that war is something only those who have served in the military can comprehend. Throughout history, art has provided a frame to create meaning out of the complicated experience of war, seek justice and imagine reconciliation. The National Veterans Art Museum (NVAM) Triennial draws on this history to connect today's veteran artists with the history of veteran creative practices and their impact on society over the past century.   The NVAM Triennial exhibition opening coincides with the inaugural Veteran Art Summit, which features a series of presentations, workshops, panels and discussions, held at the Chicago Cultural Center, DePaul Art Museum and National Veterans Art Museum.   This supplementary newspaper includes essays and descriptions of the Triennial exhibitions, the performance program, the literature component, an education guide and an overview of the Veteran Art Summit</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lavishly illustrated volume gives a voice to women who lived millennia ago in Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey, and explores their roles, representations and contributions to society.   Tens of thousands of cuneiform texts, monumental sculptures, and images on terracotta reliefs and cylinder seals cast light on the fates of women at the dawn of history, from queens to female slaves. In the patriarchal world of ancient Mesopotamia, women were often represented in their relation to men—as mothers, daughters, or wives—giving the impression that a woman's place was in the home. But, as we explore in this volume, they were also authors and scholars, astute business-women, sources of expressions of eroticism, priestesses with access to major gods and goddesses, and regents who exercised power on behalf of kingdoms, states, and empires.  This volume accompanies an exhibition at the Babylonian Collection in the Sterling Memorial Library, showcasing artefacts and texts relating to women, many never exhibited or published before.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Celebrated for his masterful brushstrokes, depictions of nature, and use of translucent blue-green pigments, Qiu Ying is the least known of the four Ming Dynasty masters of the Wu School. This elegantly produced and groundbreaking monograph, the first Western-language publication devoted to the painter, draws on new scholarship to offer a deep and rich appreciation of Qiu Ying's achievements beyond the landscapes for which he is renowned.  Over eighty of the artist's paintings, including many of his most accomplished works, are presented in glorious color illustrations. The accompanying texts point readers to the painter's key stylistic qualities and show a clear chronological framework of his development as an artist.  Fans of the lush, poetic painting of the Ming Dynasty and Chinese art history in general, will relish this definitive appreciation of an artist who transcended many boundaries that came to define Ming society and culture.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Few artists in Chinese history have proven as enigmatic as the great Ming dynasty painter Qiu Ying (c. 1494-c. 1552), whose life and art reveal a series of paradoxes. Though one of the most famous artists of the Ming period, almost nothing is known about his life. He is said to have been illiterate, yet surviving evidence demonstrates elegant writing. He is said to have had few followers, yet he was the most copied painter in Chinese history. Where the Truth Lies grapples with such issues as artists who cross social boundaries, literacy, and the importance of connoisseurship in determining quality and authenticity. This will be the first exhibition on Qiu Ying ever organized outside of Asia. In addition to masterworks by Qiu Ying, the exhibition will include works by his predecessors and teachers, his daughter Qiu Zhu, and followers from the early 16th through the mid-20th century</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Homer|Remington, the catalogue accompanying the exhibition Mythmakers: The Art of Winslow Homer and Frederic Remington, is an exploration of the unexpected resonances between the themes, artistic sensibilities, and technical process of contemporaries Winslow Homer and Frederic Remington. This is the first project to compare the work of two American artists who have, perhaps more than any other practitioners of their moment, shaped this country's perceptions about its landscapes and its peoples. Co-organized by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art (ACMAA), the Denver Art Museum (DAM), and the Portland Museum of Art (PMA), this exhibition and catalogue explore the social and cultural context in which Homer and Remington rose to prominence to reveal their shared role in creating foundational stories about the United States. The exhibition is jointly curated by Diana Greenwold, Associate Curator of American Art at the PMA, Maggie Adler, Curator of American Art at the ACMAA, Thomas Smith, Director of the Petrie Institute of Western American Art at the DAM, and Jennifer Henneman, Assistant Curator of Western American Art at the DAM.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Catalogue to accompany the exhibition, Landscapes of Extraction: The Art of Mining in the American West, on view at Phoenix Art Museum November 7, 2021 - March 6, 2022.  This exhibition, of more than fifty works of varying media and subject matter, explores the historical and contemporary impact of the mining industry on the people, places, and prosperity of the Southwest. From earlier works that celebrate the sweat of the brow and the romance of industry and productivity, to contemporary works that examine the environmental impact of mining on our desert home, Landscapes of Extraction offers a nuanced examination of the intersection of humanity, multilayered as the landscapes featured in its painting and prints, and  that both the exhibition and this accompanying catalogue will open the door to conversations about the future of industry and sustainability in the Southwest.  Hardcover, 176 pages | 100 color plates | 9 1/4 x 10 3/4</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nobles, ladies, scholars, and merchants were the subjects of Hans Holbein the Younger (1497/98–1543), an inventive German artist best known for his dazzling portraits. Holbein developed his signature style in Basel and London amid a rich culture of erudition, self-definition, and love of luxury and wit before becoming court painter to Henry VIII. Accompanying the first major Holbein exhibition in the United States, this catalogue explores his vibrant visual and intellectual approach to personal identity. In addition to reproducing many of the artist's painted and drawn portraits, this volume delves into his relationship with leading intellectuals, such as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Thomas More, as well as his contributions to publishing and book culture, meticulous inscriptions, and ingenious designs for jewels, hat badges, and other exquisite objects.  This volume is published to accompany an exhibition on view at the J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Center from October 19, 2021, to January 9, 2022 and at the Morgan Library &amp;amp; Museum from February 11 to May 15, 2022.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The art and culture of Spain significantly influenced many of America's most renowned 19th- and 20th-century artists. Mary Cassatt visited the country early in her career and first garnered the attention of the French Impressionists with her paintings of Spanish themes. William Merritt Chase, fascinated with Spanish art, traveled to Madrid and its environs to paint landscapes and study at the Prado. And Robert Henri not only drew on the country's culture and traditions as a personal muse but repeatedly brought his art students to Spain as part of their training. Featuring works by all of these artists, as well as others such as John Singer Sargent and Thomas Eakins, this handsome volume reveals the important and varied ways that Spain inspired a century of American artists.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Travelers and traveling have long been associated with American history and identity. One kind of traveler, the immigrant, occupies a central place in the national mythology about the United States as a land of opportunity, welcoming peoples from other nations. Another traveler, the tourist, exercises apparently unfettered free- dom of movement. But the story of American mobility also must include the displacement and forced migration of Indigenous people, the prejudices faced by many immigrants, and the mobility denied or forced upon enslaved and exploited peoples. These travelers nevertheless often followed the same pathways, transformed by those who preceded them and by changing technologies, but geographically durable. Crossings: Mapping American Journeys tells stories of American travel in all its diversity. With a gallery organized like a map, the exhibition traces four signi cant pathways, or "crossings" across the continental United States, illustrating them with maps and guide- books that recreate the experiences of American travelers across time and space.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Exhibition catalogue, America is haunted. Ghosts from its violent history—the genocide of Indigenous peoples, slavery, the threat of nuclear annihilation, and traumatic wars—are an inescapable and unsettled part of the nation's heritage. Not merely in the realm of metaphor but present and tangible, urgently calling for contact, these otherworldly visitors have been central to our national identity. Through times of mourning and trauma, artists have been integral to visualizing ghosts, whether national or personal, and in doing so have embraced the uncanny and the inexplicable. This stunning catalog, accompanying the first major exhibition to assess the spectral in American art, explores the numerous ways American artists have made sense of their own experiences of the paranormal and the supernatural, developing a rich visual culture of the intangible.  ?Featuring artists from James McNeill Whistler and Kerry James Marshall to artist/mediums who made images with spirits during séances, this catalog covers more than two hundred years of the supernatural in American art. Here we find works that explore haunting, UFO sightings, and a broad range of experiential responses to other worldly contact.  Details: 320 pages; 200 color plates. © 2021</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From the dawn of the medium onward, Black filmmakers have helped define American cinema. Black performers, producers and directors—Bert Williams, Oscar Micheaux, Herb Jeffries, Lena Horne, Dorothy Dandridge, Ruby Dee and William Greaves, to name just a few—had a vast and resounding impact. Black film artists not only developed an enduring independent tradition but also transformed mainstream Hollywood, fueled and reflected sociopolitical movements, captured Black experience in all its robust complexity, and influenced generations to come. As harrowing as it is beautiful, this history of Black cinema and its legacy is often overlooked.  Regeneration accompanies a first-of-its-kind exhibition at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures exploring seven decades of Black participation in American cinema. Amplifying this underrepresented history in colorful and striking detail, the book features an in-depth curatorial essay and scholarly case-study texts on topics such as early Black independent filmmaking, Black spectatorship during the Jim Crow era and home movies as an essential form of Black self-representation. The volume also makes meaningful connections to the present through interviews with award-winning contemporary Black filmmakers Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, Ava DuVernay, Barry Jenkins and Dawn Porter. An extensive filmography and chronology offer an essential resource for anyone interested in Black cinema, while images of contemporary visual artworks further illustrate the volume throughout.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From the warriors of ancient Greek legends to the knights of the middle ages to today's comic book superheroes, the idea of personal body armor has an enduring hold on the human imagination. Armor is as old and widespread as civilization itself, but full suits of articulated steel plates were made only in Europe, and only for a brief time in the late middle ages and renaissance. Far from the ungainly exoskeleton we often imagine today, the suit of armor was made to be sleek and stylish-painstakingly engineered, elegantly designed, and treasured as the expression of its owner's taste, sophistication, and prowess. This rare exhibition of highlights from one of America's foremost collections of arms and armor explores the story of armor in its golden age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Spanning all major pre-Columbian cultures of Colombia, and featuring some of the most remarkable artworks ever made in this region—from intricately cast gold pendants and ceramic effigies to modern Indigenous stools, barkcloths and featherworks—The Portable Universe/El Universo en tus Manos: Thought and Splendor of Indigenous Colombia radically recasts how we approach ancient Colombian art.  Featuring an innovative cover design with tip-on images, the book is arranged so as to envelop the works with life and meaning, and guide readers to different ways of understanding the world and our place in it. It includes insightful contributions by Indigenous Colombians, historians, ethnographers, archaeologists and art historians.  The Portable Universe/El Universo en tus Manos recaptures some of the knowledge of Indigenous American cultures and presents new historical findings, drawing heavily on contemporary Indigenous understandings to evoke a worldview in which these ancient pieces make sense and have power today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume chronicles the rise of a globally significant art movement, as told from the perspective of the Yolngu people of northeastern Australia. It presents more than 90 iconic paintings on eucalyptus bark, many of which have never been seen outside of Australia.  For millennia, Yolngu people around Yirrkala in northern Australia have painted their sacred clan designs on their bodies and ceremonial objects. These designs—called miny'tji—are not merely decorative: they are the sacred patterns of the ancestral land itself. Yolngu people describe them as madayin: a term that encompasses both the sacred and the beautiful. With the arrival of Europeans in the 20th century, Yolngu people turned to the medium of painting on eucalyptus bark with ochres. The result was an outpouring of creativity that continues to this day as artists find new and innovative ways to transform their ancient clan designs into compelling contemporary statements that is chronicled in this singular publication.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Artists in Roman Italy created exquisite landscapes that reflect close ties with their environment, ranging from sunny seascapes and tranquil country shrines to vividly imagined views of Greece and Egypt. This richly illustrated volume reveals the intimate connections between these works and ancient Romans' social, political and religious lives. The essays explore landscapes that decorated urban houses and tombs in Rome, Pompeii and Herculaneum and sumptuous coastal villas on the Bay of Naples, as well as the aims and desires of the ancient patrons who commissioned these inventive depictions of the natural world.   Landscapes in a wide variety of media—wall paintings, marble sculptures, mosaics, precious metals and gems—conveyed devotion to the gods and nostalgia for an idealized past, while celebrating Roman imperial power and technical ingenuity. This timely volume demonstrates the longevity of shared human concerns about control and development of the land, about the competing demands of wealth and piety, and about the preservation of natural resources.</Abstract>
