From the 1930s to 1970s, Harris created a richly detailed record of public personalities, historic events, and the lives of average people. In 2001, Carnegie Museum of Art purchased Harris's archive of nearly 80,000 photographic negatives, few of which are titled and dated; the archive is considered one of the most important documentations of 20th-century African American life (www.cmoa.org/teenie). The book will serve as the definitive publication on the life and work of Teenie Harris, consisting of three significant essays: Cheryl Finley, assistant professor in the history of art at Cornell University, offers the first thorough analysis of Harris as an artist, situating him within the history of 20th?century African American art as well as American documentary and vernacular photography; Larry Glasco, associate professor of history at the University of Pittsburgh, draws on new research to present a detailed biography of the photographer; and Joe Trotter, professor of history and social justice at Carnegie Mellon University, explores the social and historical context of Harris's photographs. The book will also include a foreword by Deborah Willis, professor at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU.

Elite arts and the ideologies that informed them were among the Wari's most prominent exports. From their capital, one of the largest archaeological sites in South America, they sent their religion along with elaborate objects and textiles out to highland provincial centers hundreds of miles to the north and south, and down into populous Pacific coastal areas to the west. The arts were crucial to the Wari's political, economic, and religious communications: like other ancient Andean peoples, they did not write. The objects featured here cover the full range of Wari arts: elaborate textiles, which probably were at the core of their value systems; sophisticated ceramics of various styles; exquisite personal ornaments made of gold, silver, shell, or bone and often inlaid with precious materials; carved wood containers; and other works in stone and fiber. 200+ color illustrations",Susan Bergh,Exhibition Catalog,http://www.clevelandart.org/visit/Exhibitions.aspx?pid={5CD3C2E0-AD02-45C8-9643-D7EB926CA1E2},,Thames &amp; Hudson,,,Wari: Lords of the Ancient Andes,2012

At the turn of the 20th century, many Italians immigrants came to work, earn money to support their families, and eventually return home. Nearly half of the first generation Italian immigrants did return to Italy, but for those that made America home, their struggle to maintain a distinct Italian culture was guided by remarkably powerful ideals of family that had always been at the center of their lives.   While the power of the Italian family became a source of strength, it also bred suspicion, popularized in popular media as a dark, criminal element. This clash of culture echoed through generations of Italian Americans as they entered positions of political, social, and cultural influence.

10829,FB-56134-12,"In the years between World War I and World War II Paris was at the center of the art&#x0D; world. Indeed, the very essence of twentieth-century art history stems from the movements and&#x0D; avant-garde experiments that emerged there in the early years of the century. Mexican artist Angel Zárraga was one of the few Latin American artists who opted to make Paris his permanent home, however, only returning to Mexico under duress at the onset of World War II. Because of the intensified artistic activity in Mexico after the Revolution, Mexican artists often made only short sojourns to Paris, while their contemporaries from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Chile flooded Parisian arts academies and salons between the wars. Since Mexico had become a locus for experimental and socially motivated artistic activity, Zárraga's decision to stay in Paris puts him at odds with many of his compatriots. Moreover, Zárraga chose not to construct an identity for himself as a Mexican artist in Paris, and his sole association with Mexican cultural initiatives was his commission for the murals at the Mexican Legation, where he asserted quite overtly the cultural hegemony of France. He did not associate with the newly formed circles of Latin American artists in the city or participate in their exhibitions such as the Exposition d'Art Américain-Latin at the Musée Galliera in 1924 or Joaquín Torres-García's Première exposition du groupe latino-americain de Paris at the Galerie Zak in 1930; rather he preferred to distance himself from groups defined by cultural identity and instead align his work with the subjects and styles of European modernism.",Michele Greet,Exhibition Catalog,,,"Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City",,,"“From Cubism to Muralism: Angel Zárraga in Paris,” in Ángel Zárraga.

14540,GI-261115-18,"How West African gold and trade across the Sahara were central to the medieval world  The Sahara Desert was a thriving crossroads of exchange for West Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe in the medieval period. Fueling this exchange was West African gold, prized for its purity and used for minting currencies and adorning luxury objects such as jewelry, textiles, and religious objects. Caravans made the arduous journey by camel southward across the Sahara carrying goods for trade—glass vessels and beads, glazed ceramics, copper, books, and foodstuffs, including salt, which was obtained in the middle of the desert. Northward, the journey brought not only gold but also ivory, animal hides and leatherwork, spices, and captives from West Africa forced into slavery.  Caravans of Gold, Fragments in Time draws on the latest archaeological discoveries and art historical research to construct a compelling look at medieval trans-Saharan exchange and its legacy. Contributors from diverse disciplines present case studies that form a rich portrayal of a distant time. Topics include descriptions of key medieval cities around the Sahara; networks of exchange that contributed to the circulation of gold, copper, and ivory and their associated art forms; and medieval glass bead production in West Africa's forest region. The volume also reflects on Morocco's Gnawa material culture, associated with descendants of West African slaves, and movements of people across the Sahara today.  Featuring a wealth of color images, this fascinating book demonstrates how the rootedness of place, culture, and tradition is closely tied to the circulation of people, objects, and ideas. These ""fragments in time"" offer irrefutable evidence of the key role that Africa played in medieval history and promote a new understanding of the past and the present.","Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Chris Abani, Robert Launay, Ralph A.

As an interdisciplinary project, the ""Dharma and Pu?ya…"" exhibition catalog underscores the contributions of people – patrons, donors, ritual specialists, or devotees –  in creating and amplifying the efficacy of the artistic productions that are instrumental in expressing religious devotion and recording traditional ritual observances.  To this end, ritual objects will be juxtaposed with what may be collected in the West as ""fine art objects"" like scroll paintings, painted manuscripts, wooden carvings, repoussé icons, or gilded images. The Nepalese ""paubhas"" (the term for hanging paintings on cloth in Nepal) and manuscripts  are also frequently accompanied by colophons containing historical records of initial donations and subsequent ritual use. To date, no systematic attempt has been made to address the living traditions of Buddhist Devotionalism that underlie them. Sixty objects drawn from eight museums and two private collections will be displayed in the exhibition along with wooden carvings and a paubha painting commissioned for the exhibition from local artists in Kathmandu.

Tens of thousands of cuneiform texts, monumental sculptures, and images on terracotta reliefs and cylinder seals cast light on the fates of women at the dawn of history, from queens to female slaves. In the patriarchal world of ancient Mesopotamia, women were often represented in their relation to men—as mothers, daughters, or wives—giving the impression that a woman's place was in the home. But, as we explore in this volume, they were also authors and scholars, astute business-women, sources of expressions of eroticism, priestesses with access to major gods and goddesses, and regents who exercised power on behalf of kingdoms, states, and empires.

The exhibition is jointly curated by Diana Greenwold, Associate Curator of American Art at the PMA, Maggie Adler, Curator of American Art at the ACMAA, Thomas Smith, Director of the Petrie Institute of Western American Art at the DAM, and Jennifer Henneman, Assistant Curator of Western American Art at the DAM.","Jennifer Henneman, Diana Greenwold, Maggie Adler, Thomas Smith",Exhibition Catalog,http://https://www.worldcat.org/title/homer-remington/oclc/1153392845&amp;referer=brief results,"The real thing: Homer, Remington, and the American empirical tradition Adam Gopnik PrologueThomas Brent Smith Materialize the spirit: Homer and Remington as painters of sensation Margaret C.

Holbein developed his signature style in Basel and London amid a rich culture of erudition, self-definition, and love of luxury and wit before becoming court painter to Henry VIII. Accompanying the first major Holbein exhibition in the United States, this catalogue explores his vibrant visual and intellectual approach to personal identity. In addition to reproducing many of the artist's painted and drawn portraits, this volume delves into his relationship with leading intellectuals, such as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Thomas More, as well as his contributions to publishing and book culture, meticulous inscriptions, and ingenious designs for jewels, hat badges, and other exquisite objects.  This volume is published to accompany an exhibition on view at the J.

Mary Cassatt visited the country early in her career and first garnered the attention of the French Impressionists with her paintings of Spanish themes. William Merritt Chase, fascinated with Spanish art, traveled to Madrid and its environs to paint landscapes and study at the Prado. And Robert Henri not only drew on the country's culture and traditions as a personal muse but repeatedly brought his art students to Spain as part of their training. Featuring works by all of these artists, as well as others such as John Singer Sargent and Thomas Eakins, this handsome volume reveals the important and varied ways that Spain inspired a century of American artists.","Brandon Ruud, Abert Family Curator of American Art, Milwaukee Art Museum, Corey Piper, Brock Curator of American Art, Chrysler Museum of Art",Exhibition Catalog,https://www.worldcat.org/title/americans-in-spain-painting-and-travel-1820-1920/oclc/1259452936&amp;referer=brief results,Worldcat website,Yale University Press,,,"Americans in Spain: Painting and Travel, 1820-1920",2020

21857,GE-271463-20,"Travelers and traveling have long been associated with American history and identity. One kind of traveler, the immigrant, occupies a central place in the national mythology about the United States as a land of opportunity, welcoming peoples from other nations. Another traveler, the tourist, exercises apparently unfettered free- dom of movement. But the story of American mobility also must include the displacement and forced migration of Indigenous people, the prejudices faced by many immigrants, and the mobility denied or forced upon enslaved and exploited peoples. These travelers nevertheless often followed the same pathways, transformed by those who preceded them and by changing technologies, but geographically durable. Crossings: Mapping American Journeys tells stories of American travel in all its diversity. With a gallery organized like a map, the exhibition traces four signi cant pathways, or ""crossings"" across the continental United States, illustrating them with maps and guide- books that recreate the experiences of American travelers across time and space.","James R.

21952,GI-278350-21,"Exhibition catalogue, America is haunted. Ghosts from its violent history—the genocide of Indigenous peoples, slavery, the threat of nuclear annihilation, and traumatic wars—are an inescapable and unsettled part of the nation's heritage. Not merely in the realm of metaphor but present and tangible, urgently calling for contact, these otherworldly visitors have been central to our national identity. Through times of mourning and trauma, artists have been integral to visualizing ghosts, whether national or personal, and in doing so have embraced the uncanny and the inexplicable. This stunning catalog, accompanying the first major exhibition to assess the spectral in American art, explores the numerous ways American artists have made sense of their own experiences of the paranormal and the supernatural, developing a rich visual culture of the intangible.  ?Featuring artists from James McNeill Whistler and Kerry James Marshall to artist/mediums who made images with spirits during séances, this catalog covers more than two hundred years of the supernatural in American art. Here we find works that explore haunting, UFO sightings, and a broad range of experiential responses to other worldly contact.

21965,GI-278330-21,"From the dawn of the medium onward, Black filmmakers have helped define American cinema. Black performers, producers and directors—Bert Williams, Oscar Micheaux, Herb Jeffries, Lena Horne, Dorothy Dandridge, Ruby Dee and William Greaves, to name just a few—had a vast and resounding impact. Black film artists not only developed an enduring independent tradition but also transformed mainstream Hollywood, fueled and reflected sociopolitical movements, captured Black experience in all its robust complexity, and influenced generations to come. As harrowing as it is beautiful, this history of Black cinema and its legacy is often overlooked.  Regeneration accompanies a first-of-its-kind exhibition at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures exploring seven decades of Black participation in American cinema. Amplifying this underrepresented history in colorful and striking detail, the book features an in-depth curatorial essay and scholarly case-study texts on topics such as early Black independent filmmaking, Black spectatorship during the Jim Crow era and home movies as an essential form of Black self-representation. The volume also makes meaningful connections to the present through interviews with award-winning contemporary Black filmmakers Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, Ava DuVernay, Barry Jenkins and Dawn Porter.

Armor is as old and widespread as civilization itself, but full suits of articulated steel plates were made only in Europe, and only for a brief time in the late middle ages and renaissance. Far from the ungainly exoskeleton we often imagine today, the suit of armor was made to be sleek and stylish-painstakingly engineered, elegantly designed, and treasured as the expression of its owner's taste, sophistication, and prowess.

It presents more than 90 iconic paintings on eucalyptus bark, many of which have never been seen outside of Australia.  For millennia, Yolngu people around Yirrkala in northern Australia have painted their sacred clan designs on their bodies and ceremonial objects. These designs—called miny'tji—are not merely decorative: they are the sacred patterns of the ancestral land itself. Yolngu people describe them as madayin: a term that encompasses both the sacred and the beautiful. With the arrival of Europeans in the 20th century, Yolngu people turned to the medium of painting on eucalyptus bark with ochres. The result was an outpouring of creativity that continues to this day as artists find new and innovative ways to transform their ancient clan designs into compelling contemporary statements that is chronicled in this singular publication.","Kade McDonald, Henry Skerritt, W.

This richly illustrated volume reveals the intimate connections between these works and ancient Romans' social, political and religious lives. The essays explore landscapes that decorated urban houses and tombs in Rome, Pompeii and Herculaneum and sumptuous coastal villas on the Bay of Naples, as well as the aims and desires of the ancient patrons who commissioned these inventive depictions of the natural world.   Landscapes in a wide variety of media—wall paintings, marble sculptures, mosaics, precious metals and gems—conveyed devotion to the gods and nostalgia for an idealized past, while celebrating Roman imperial power and technical ingenuity.
