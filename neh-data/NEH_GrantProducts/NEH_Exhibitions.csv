527,TR-50008-08,"In January 1955, celebrated photographer W. Eugene Smith quit his longtime job at Life magazine. In search of greater freedom and artistic license, he accepted a three-week freelance assignment in Pittsburgh that turned into a four-year obsession and, in the end, remained unfinished.  In 1957, he moved out of the home he shared with his wife and four children in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, and into a dilapidated, five-story loft building at 821 Sixth Avenue (between 28th and 29th streets) in New York City's wholesale flower district. The building was a late-night haunt of musicians, including some of the biggest names in jazz—Charles Mingus, Zoot Sims, Bill Evans, and Thelonious Monk among them—and countless fascinating, underground characters. As his epic Pittsburgh project broke down, Smith found solace in the chaotic, somnambulistic world of the loft and its artists.  The exhibition evokes the jazz loft through more than 200 images, several hours of audio, and 16mm film footage of Smith working in the loft. Setting the scene is Smith's gritty photographs of the loft and his pictures of the flower district below his fourth-floor loft window. Viewed alongside his master prints, Smith's 5x7-inch work prints further indicate the breadth and depth of the loft story. Listening stations give access to remastered selections from Smith's reel-to-reel tapes, which caught everything from rousing jam sessions to historic radio and TV broadcasts, loft conversations, and street noise.

2502,RA-50036-06,"Guest curated by Martin Bruckner, Ph.D. (NEH Fellow 2008-9), Winterthur Museum has developed an innovative exhibition entitled, Common Destinations: Maps in the American Experience.   Opening on April 20, 2013 and continuing through January 2014, this exhibition explores the importance of maps in American everyday lives and material culture. From about 1750 to 1860, the decorative use of maps shifted from rare display devices to ubiquitous commercial objects. As they do today, map materials were immersed in people's senses in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they will ultimately be explored in this landmark exhibition in terms of how the constant interaction with maps shaped American spatial imagination. This exhibition also stresses the decorative use of maps, which were not always used for the purposes usually associated with them. Like other fine and decorative arts, they performed an aesthetic and cultural role in American society. Historically significant maps will be paired with paintings, textiles, scientific instruments, and ephemera primarily from Winterthur's collections to illustrate this point and underscore how these material maps affected men, women, and children from all ranks, genders, and races. To date, no other exhibition has placed maps in multi-media vignettes to contextualize how they were displayed and used. The exhibition is also well-suited to an IPod tour and web-components such as an online virtual exhibition and map-related database, projects we are currently exploring. Additional activities include a two-day symposium with leading scholars in the field on the material culture of maps. A brown bag lunch series and school programs will encourage diverse visitors to further learn about and explore the many ways in which maps were, and continue to be, important visual components of everyday life.","Martin Bruckner, Ph.D.",http://www.winterthur.org/?p=1057,"Winterthur's public description for the exhibition on our website.

Born and raised in Boston, Jones attended the SMFA during high school and earned a scholarship that enabled her to receive her degree in Design with honors in 1927. In 1937, she took a sabbatical from her teaching job at Howard University and spent a year in Paris, where she attended the Académie Julian, frequented museums and galleries, and noted in an interview in the Women's Art Journal that she was far freer as an African American woman in Paris than she was in the art world in the United States. After her marriage to Haitian graphic artist Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noël in 1953, Jones found inspiration in the spiritual beliefs, sights, and sounds of Haiti. A trip to Africa in 1970 to meet with contemporary artists there brought to fruition Jones's earlier interest in African art.

One of the rare African American photojournalists in the field, Parks was frequently given magazine assignments involving social issues that his white colleagues were not asked to cover. In 1950, Parks returned to his hometown in Kansas to make a series of photographs meant to accompany an article that he planned to call ""Back to Fort Scott."" &#x0D; &#x0D; Fort Scott was the town that he had left more than 20 years earlier, when after his mother died, he found himself—a teenager and the youngest of 15 children—suddenly having to make his own way in the world. He used this assignment to revisit early memories of his birthplace, many involving serious racial discrimination, and to reconnect with childhood friends, all of whom had attended the same all-black grade school as Parks. One of the most visually rich and captivating of all his projects, Parks's photographs, now owned by The Gordon Parks Foundation, were slated to appear in April 1951, but the photo essay was never published.

American Cool is embodied by one hundred icons as captured by fine art photographers from Carl Van Vechten to Annie Leibovitz. Since the 1950s, the term and concept of cool has been intrinsic to any understanding of American culture through the idea of cultural rebellion. Joel Dinerstein provides a theory of cool, explores its origins in the postwar era, then analyzes its three generational shifts in the '60s, the '80s, and into the present.

The dispersal of movie watching across technologies and contexts follows the multiplexing of movie theaters, itself a fragmenting of the single screen theater where movie love was first concentrated and consecrated. (But even in the ""good old days,"" movies were often only part of an evening's entertainment that came complete with vaudeville acts and bank nights.) For all this, movie going still means what it always meant, joining a community, forming an audience and participating in a collective dream. As the way we experience movies evolves, the Archive takes an international look at how the movies have depicted movie-going over these years of change. The selected films carry us from the anarchic, freewheeling exhibition of the early silent era, through the exalting opulence of movie palaces to the post-war rise of exploitation shockers and into the romantic nostalgia for pre-television days gone by. Whether a moviegoer in France, Italy, Argentina or Taiwan, the current sense of loss at the passing of an exhibition era takes its place in the ongoing history of cultural and industrial transformation reflected in these films. Preceding the features, this series will also present a selection of related cartoons, short subjects, theater advertisements, promotional films, trailers and other exhibition ephemera that reflect the rich mix of media that has also, always shaped our shared visions in the dark.

14809,GI-259366-18,"Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: Paradox of Liberty is an exhibition that uses Monticello, the home and plantation of Thomas Jefferson, as a lens through which to explore the dilemma of slavery and the lives of the enslaved families and their descendants. Thomas Jefferson's iconic words in the Declaration of Independence—""all men are created equal""—inaugurated a new nation defined by principles of freedom and self-government, while a fifth of the population remained enslaved. Jefferson called slavery ""an abominable crime,"" yet he owned 607 people over the course of his lifetime. This exhibition uses the power of place and ideas at Monticello to grapple with the paradox of slavery in an age of liberty. Most notably, Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello brings individuals and families out of the shadows of chattel slavery, pulling from more than 50 years of archaeology, documentary research, and oral histories to fill in the critical human dimension missing from many resources on slavery in the United States. Through the exhibition, visitors can ""meet"" members of six families who lived and labored at Monticello, as well as their descendants. Their family stories form a narrative arc from slavery to freedom that reflects the trajectory of the nation at large – our ongoing journey to realize the foundational promise that ""all men are created equal.""",Emilie Johnson,https://www.monticello.org/slavery-at-monticello,"How could the author of the Declaration of the Independence own slaves?

15439,RQ-50842-14,"This exhibition explores the hidden histories and complex legacies of one of the most influential books in the field of anthropology, Franz Boas's The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians (1897). Groundbreaking in its holistic detail, this portrait of a Native North American society was the result of Boas's fieldwork among the Kwakwa ka 'wakw of British Columbia and a collaboration with his Indigenous research partner, George Hunt. Drawing on a Kwakwa ka 'wakw metaphor, Boas imagined his book as a storage box for ""laws and stories,"" preserving them for science in case the culture vanished under colonial impact. In fact, the book fails to address three important aspects of its making: Canada's assimilation policy, which outlawed potlatch ceremonies; the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where Boas and Hunt conducted much of their fieldwork; and Hunt's status as a full co-author. In the early 1920s, Hunt took it upon himself to correct and expand the book, in part by reconnecting hereditary treasures to the families to whom they belong. Hundreds of pages of unpublished revisions were consigned to archives after Boas's death, examples of which have been reunited with the book for the first time. The exhibition—with designs by artist Corrine Hunt, a great-granddaughter of George Hunt—features ceremonial objects as well as rare archival photographs, manuscripts, and drawings that shed new light on the book and advance understanding of the ongoing cultural traditions it documents.","Corrine Hunt, Exhibition Artist, Aaron Glass",https://www.bgc.bard.edu/gallery/exhibitions/88/the-story-box,Bard Graduate Center's Gallery webpage,,,"The Story Box: Franz Boas, George Hunt and the Making of Anthropology",2019

17184,PY-263659-19,"Gold strikes in Montana sparked the first waves of immigration to the territory, and Europeans from many nations were among the hopeful miners drawn to Bannack, Virginia City, Helena, and Butte. With a strong history of silver and copper mining beginning in the 11th century, the first Germans drawn to Butte were miners, including eight prospectors who relocated from Virginia City to a rich mining district near Fairmont, later named German Gulch. Meanwhile, up on the Butte Hill, the Germania Mine yielded a rich return of silver, then zinc and manganese. The early German influence in Butte mining was captured in the original motto for the Montana School of Mines: ""Gluck Aüf,"" or Good Luck, in German.   In 1869 James Ashley, governor of the young territory of Montana, joined the western railroad companies in recruiting immigrants to travel further west as they landed in New York and sending pamphlets to Germany and Scandinavian countries to attract immigrants to Montana.  By 1900, there were more than 1,200 German immigrants in Butte. About 25% of these new arrivals found work in the mines, as the city became a melting pot of workers and miners living together in densely built neighborhoods. While German residents were scattered throughout the Mining City, the neighborhood of Williamsburg on the south edge of town became an enclave of Germans who worked at the nearby Colorado Smelter and the German-run breweries. The German stronghold in Williamsburg is still reflected today in its street names – Munich, Berlin, Bavaria, Leipzig and Stuttgart.","Madie Westrom,",https://www.butteallnations.com/german-overview,This URL was purchased to create the on-line exhibit.

17288,FT-254705-17,"For over a century Americans debated whether women should vote. They wondered: was voting compatible with women's traditional domestic work? If women participated in politics, would men continue as heads of the family? Would women remain virtuous and ""feminine"" or would they start to look and act like men?  In Massachusetts, suffragists were especially powerful. In 1850, Worcester hosted the first national women's rights convention. Later, Lucy Stone led the nation's largest suffrage organization and edited the longest-running women's rights newspaper from her Park Street office. In 1895, fellow Bostonian Josephine Ruffin founded one of the first national groups to advocate for the rights of women of color.  Local anti-suffragists proved influential too. Their arguments against extending the vote to women dominated legislative debates and newspaper articles. In 1895, Massachusetts men and women formed the nation's first organized anti-suffrage association.  This online presentation highlights the fight over a woman's right to vote in Massachusetts by illustrating the arguments made by suffragists and their opponents. Women at the polls might seem unremarkable today; but these contentious campaigns prove that suffragists had to work hard to persuade men to vote to share the ballot. These century-old arguments formed the foundations for today's debates about gender and politics.  Please note: This online presentation was derived from an exhibition, ""Can She Do It?"": Massachusetts Debates A Woman's Right to Vote, which was on display at the Massachusetts Historical Society between 26 April 2019 and 21 September 2019.

This exhibition presents the images that leading activists wanted the public to see—and some that they wanted to hide. White suffragists portrayed themselves as elite, educated, and moral women. Some aspects of their campaign assured skeptics that the amendment would preserve white supremacy and pose no challenges to the disfranchisement strategies which affected black women and men alike in the Jim Crow South. Lacking funds and support from the white-dominated press, suffragists of color typically employed images on a smaller scale. Their pictures are less familiar but no less powerful. They demonstrate the movement's breadth, emphasis, and savvy for visual politics. Pro– and anti–women's rights images offer more than a look at the past: they illustrate the vibrant debates about the status of women in the United States that continue in images today.",Allison Lange,https://long19.radcliffe.harvard.edu/projects/exhibit seeingcitizens/,Link to digital version of exhibition.,,,“Seeing Citizens: Picturing American Women’s Fight for the Vote”,2020

18678,GI-269725-20,"When Women Lost the Vote: A Revolutionary Story, 1776-1807 examines the little-known history of the nation's first women voters – the New Jersey women who legally held the vote more than 100 years before the Nineteenth Amendment granted American women the franchise. Based on newly discovered voter records, the exhibition explores the experiences of a generation of women voters and asks how the American Revolution shaped women's political opportunities and activism. Through original objects, interactives, and immersive physical environments, it unpacks the influence of these women on the later suffrage movement and the significance of their stories for the ongoing women's rights movement. Timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the passage of women's suffrage, When Women Lost the Vote is an inspiring story that will encourage visitors to consider that progress is not linear, but that rights and liberties require constant vigilance to preserve and protect. Although New Jersey ultimately restricted the vote to propertied white men in 1807, women's fight for equality did not end there. Rather, that earlier Revolutionary fight became a rallying cry as another generation of women took up the mantle of the suffrage movement decades later.","Marcella Micucci, Philip Mead",https://www.amrevmuseum.org/exhibits/when-women-lost-the-vote-a-revolutionary-story,"Website of the Museum of the American Revolution.

During the nineteenth century, artists increasingly added Spain to their European tours to study the masterworks in the Prado Museum and to capture the country's scenic charms and customs. The exhibition features artists and movements that expand upon areas of particular strength in the Museum's collection, including artists of the Ashcan Circle and the Eight, as well as major canvases by Mary Cassatt, William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri, and John Singer Sargent. Also among the highlights are Sargent's famous Carmencita (1890) from the Musée d'Orsay; a newly discovered painting by Mary Cassatt from a Madrid private collection never before shown in the United States; and Spanish old masters on loan from the Prado Museum that American painters copied.  The exhibition's more than 100 paintings, photographs, and prints are presented chronologically and organized to emphasize migration, tourism, and travel in nineteenth-century Spain.

19786,GE-269603-20,"This landmark exhibition is the most comprehensive project to date dedicated to the cultural traditions associated with the farming and weaving of brown cotton in Acadiana.   Acadian Brown Cotton: The Fabric of Acadiana is much like the blankets on view in that it is composed of many, many threads. The exhibition tells several stories that, taken as a whole, represent an ambitious synthesis of folklore, anthropology, economics, and art history. First, the manner in which weaving practices were passed largely from mother to daughter is conveyed through genealogical analyses that illustrate, in a general sense, how weaving as a cultural idiom in Acadiana tended to spread geographically. The weaving process is explained and illustrated through home furnishings that were common in Acadian households before the mid-twentieth century. Viewers will learn how economic conditions in Acadiana played an important role in the revitalization of brown cotton weaving, especially in the last 150 years, and how the current wave of weaving revitalization has become an economic and cultural force. Specifically, emphasis is placed on the community organizing activities of the non-profit Field to Fashion in Acadiana.    Finally, Acadian Brown Cotton: The Fabric of Acadiana addresses brown cotton weaving from the standpoint of visual culture. Social documentary photographer Leah Greaff's photographs reflect a keen eye and provoke concepts of artistic intention, symbolism, art as commodity, and the difficulty of navigating between artistic classifications such as decorative and fine art.  Master spinner and weaver Elaine Larcade Bourque, as well as Ben Koch, Lena Kolb, LaChaun Moore, and Francis Pavy are some of the artists whose work is included in the exhibition. Their creations illustrate how weaving traditions can or have become more symbolically important than subsistence practitioners ever thought possible.","Benjamin Hickey, Elaine Bourque, Sharon Donnan",http://thefabricofacadiana.org/look/,"Link to the genealogy, historic maps, photographs, furniture, tools, and brown cotton textiles.

Bookending this dynamic experience are two ""Focus Galleries"" that will showcase, respectively, the situation in Concord that precipitated the bloody battle and how the town commemorated these historic events 100 years later.

Over ten years in the making, the new galleries pay tribute to the everyday men and women, sometimes forgotten to history, who lived in Concord and participated in its growing agricultural and artisan community, as well as their revolutionary contributions to American society.   Phase 3 of the new installation (opened September 2021) covers over 250 years of Concord's history, featuring stories drawn from the Museum's nationally significant collection—from 17th century embroidery to Henry David Thoreau's humble green desk which is celebrated with a beautiful media presentation. Visitors can also engage with Ralph Waldo Emerson's study through a new multi-media interactive and watch a video of historian Laura Walls put Thoreau and Emerson's lives and friendship in perspective.

20149,ZPA-284197-22,"Throughout modern history, the mining industry has transformed the American West, competing with the scenic landscape on its own terms. In the first half of the 20th century, large-scale and open pit mines across Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah dramatically altered the natural environment and dictated the lives of those who worked in them, with cyclical booms that provided employment for generations of families and economic crashes that often left ghost towns and mass unemployment in their wake.  In the Copper State, mining has been fundamental to Arizona's regional identity since the time of statehood in 1912, when an economy built around the five C's—cattle, cotton, citrus, climate, and copper—began to take shape. In fact, mining, ranching, agriculture, and tourism still significantly define Arizona's cultural identity, even today. Over the decades, mining has continued to shape natural landscapes across the western United States, creating striking views in their own right. However, public knowledge on the destructive environmental and health effects of mining, as well as its massive impact on social, economic, and political systems, has increased, revealing the vexed legacy of the industry. Through more than 80 paintings, prints, and sculptures, Landscapes of Extraction: The Art of Mining in the American West explores the modern evolution of mining imagery from the 1910s to the present. The exhibition begins with works from the early- to mid-20th century, when artists portrayed regional themes and industries in their work, inspired, in part, by New Deal programs during the 1930s and early 1940s. Contemporary works created into the 2010s stand in contrast by demonstrating how artists have, over time, become more attuned to the monumental impact that humans, technology, mining, and other industries have on the natural world, with a number examining the ongoing legacy of pollution specifically.","Betsy Fahlman, Ph.D., Adjunct Curator of American art at Phoenix Art Museum",https://phxart.org/exhibition/landscapes-of-extraction/,"Landscapes of Extraction: The Art of Mining in the American West - Phoenix Art Museum - November 7, 2021 – March 6, 2022",,,Landscapes of Extraction: The Art of Mining in the American West,2021

To Be Sold will raise awareness of the scope of the domestic trade in American-born enslaved people that developed after the United States ended its participation in the international trade in 1808. The panel exhibition and programs will feature Crowe's surviving paintings—Slaves Waiting for Sale and After the Sale—which provide some of the most powerful and compelling visual evidence of the domestic slave trade in antebellum America. Virginia was the largest mass exporter of enslaved people through the Richmond market, making the trade the most important economic activity in antebellum Virginia.",Maurie D.

20598,FT-60525-13,"Other Points of View seeks to examine the context and legacy of the arts journal View, edited by Charles Henri Ford and Parker Tyler and in circulation from 1940 to 1947. Bringing together over 100 works, the exhibition re-introduces artists and critics, such as Charles Henri Ford, Parker Tyler and Pavel Tchelitchew, and re-contextualizes modernists now considered canonical, such as Alexander Calder, Isamu Noguchi and Georgia O'Keeffe. Presenting the contributions of surrealists, magic realists, neo-romantics, and self-taught artists from Europe and the Americas, Other Points of View explores how the magazine cultivated alternative understandings of both the qualifier ""American"" and the term ""modernism.""    Anchored by magazine covers, paintings, sculptures and photographs, Other Points of View highlights the creative output of the magazine's contributors, who worked in collaborative arenas including opera, ballet, and theater. One example of this is the exhibition's presentation of Four Saints in Three Acts, which premiered in 1934 with libretto by Gertrude Stein, score by Virgil Thomson, choreography by Frederick Ashton, décor by Florine Stettheimer, and an all African American chorus directed by Eva Jessye.  With an emphasis on ephemeral objects, the exhibition also spotlights the social networks, events and communities that surrounded View, arguing that, through the small exhibitions and lavish opening parties it hosted, the publication was part of New York Bohemia's social season, thus expanding beyond the boundaries of the printed magazine. In assessing this aspect of the publication, Other Points of View aims to consider how View counterbalanced the progress-based narrative often associated with modernism. Similarly, by surveying the homophilia, anti-racism, and sex-positivity embodied by the magazine, the exhibition addresses the criticism the group of artists attracted, including attacks from Clement Greenberg and André Breton.",Tirza True Latimer,http://https://www.leslielohman.org/archive/other-points-of-view,Link to Leslie Lohman Museum of Art Archive containing curatorial essay for the exhibition Other Points of View,,,Other Points of View,2020

Typically minted in inexpensive metals, these specialized coins were only redeemable at stores owned by the company that issued them. Companies often claimed that the scrip system smoothed over the process of payment in isolated rural areas, but more often than not this also created a kind of debt bondage that kept coal miners and their families tied to their employer for almost everything they needed to survive. 16 Tons, our new online exhibit of company scrip and tokens, highlights the unique scrip coinage of the southern West Virginia coalfields.",Shaun Slifer,http://https://hub.catalogit.app/4046/folder/31171da0-1e44-11eb-9f4f-bf1de2f3133e,This URL will take you directly to the online exhibit hosted by CatalogIt.,http://wvminewars.org/online-exhibits,This URL will take you to the webpage for all online exhibitions produced by the West Virginia Mine Wars Museum.,16 Tons: Coal Company Scrip &amp; Tokens,2022

Nature and culture are ever evolving, and Goucher has experienced much of this change itself. Our exhibition, a ""Goucher Wunderkammer for the 21st century,"" explores the power of specimens, artifacts, and art to tell stories of change. As part of Professor April Oettinger's Complex Problem Exploration course, Inventing Nature (CPEC 213), students spent Fall 2021 understanding and exploring our home collections, which include the Natural History Collection (located in the basement of Hoffberger), Special Collections and Archives and The Art and Artifact Collection. Through trips to local museums such as the Baltimore Museum of Art, The Walters Art Museum, The Smithsonian Natural History Museum, and academic institutions such as The Johns Hopkins University, students were given the opportunity to explore different modes of display and cultures of collecting through history. What you see here before you is a carefully curated and arranged display of specimens, artifacts, and objects centered around themes of nature and artifice—naturalia and artificialia—and the blurred relationship between the two. Throughout the process of mounting this exhibition, students asked themselves about the relationship between humans and nature, what nature means to them, and how the natural world has shaped their own culture and values.  Goucher students developed, researched, curated, authored, and designed every aspect of this exhibition. We wish to thank Alex Ebstein, Curator of the Silber Gallery; Professor Phong Le, Director of the Makerspace; Kristen Welzenbach, Curator of Special Collections &amp; Archives; and Andrew Voytek, Director of Facilities; for their assistance and support.

That Riccio was able to create these revealing and sensitive portraits speaks to the trust he inspired in those with whom he worked. Breaking through the usual ""veil of silence"" in which elderly Italian-Americans typically enveloped themselves to guard against the unwarranted hostilities of outsiders, the artist was welcomed into his subjects' homes and lives. That trust is evident in the stories that these, the so-called anziani, shared with Riccio. It is also written on their countenances, which bear witness to an era marked not only by grueling physical labor and taxing living conditions but also by enduring faith as well as an unwavering commitment to family, friends, and country, both natal and adoptive.

These final resting places were, therefore, well-provisioned by surviving family members with mingqi, or ""spirit articles,"" for the deceased's journey into the afterlife; an essential component of such rites, since those not properly prepared for the next world could return to visit misfortune upon the living.

These families carried their culture with them through their migrations to other states for seasonal and permanent work during the 19th and 20th centuries. These migrations represent Manito family values in surviving, even if it meant leaving the homes they cherished. Their contributions significantly impacted the American West through their labor in sheepherding, coal mining, railroad construction, and the sugar beet fields. Wherever they went, they never forgot their roots in New Mexico, and they shaped their new homes in other states to preserve and adapt their cultural traditions that they brought with them. For some families, the following generations stayed in their diaspora homes, and, for others, they returned to New Mexico. Through their descendents, Manito families carry on the legacy of shaping the northern New Mexico cultural landscape through professions in medicine, the humanities, the arts, linguistics, and agriculture. Through sounds and sights, this exhibition highlights Manito family histories; the significance of storytelling, farming, agricultural, poetic, religious, and culinary practices to Manito families; and the Hispanic art forms of santos and colchas.

The exhibit at North Dakota State University Library focuses on Staying Above Water; Fargo-Moorhead Floods. For over 100 years, Red River floods defined the cities and people who experienced the rising waters – not only due to the destruction, but the feelings and relationships developed during a time of restoration. Some areas may still show the wear and tear of the flood, but nearby restaurants, shops, and other small businesses are alive and bustling. The images in the exhibit show a community with some scars, but one that continued on strong. Those affected by the flood remember the experience in multiple ways including books, plays, and collections of photographs.","Susanne Caro, Trista Raezer-Stursa, Chelsea Olmsted",https://disasterexhibit.org/,"Disasterexhibit.org is a tool for exploring the nature of disasters, and how local communities respond to and remember these events.

The exhibition tells the story of how the eastern Mediterranean—Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian territories, and Cyprus—was a hub of cultural exchange and creativity from 1500 BCE to 1000 CE, connected through trade, migration, religion, and empire across the Mediterranean to Egypt, Arabia, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia. At the same time, this area has been home to distinctive and diverse local cultures, where innovations like the alphabet and monotheism first emerged.

22820,PF-266774-19,"Précis  From around 1400 until the early 1600s, armorers were part of complex networks of artists, tradesmen, agents, and patrons that animated burgeoning artistic centers both north and south of the Alps. The collaborations and innovations that forged steel plate armor sparked creativity across many areas of the arts and sciences, and fostered prosperity for the steel towns of Renaissance Europe.  Exhibition Summary  During the Renaissance, plate armor was more than a defensive technology for war or knightly sport. It was a meaningful, multi-media form of kinetic sculpture, combining high fashion with cutting-edge engineering. The most luxurious and innovative armors commanded astronomical prices and—when worn in courtly pageants, in the tournament arena, or on the battlefield—participated in unforgettable events. This exhibition seeks to resituate armorers within the story of European art from the 15th through 17th centuries and to trace the ways that their artistic networks shaped civic landscapes and urban communities. Armorers' workshops served as sites of intersection, collaboration, and inspiration for artists and craftspeople working in other media, including precious metalwork, printmaking, painting, and cutting-edge mechanical technologies like clockmaking.   Numerous exhibitions have invited visitors to explore the exciting world of knightly sport embodied in jousts and tournaments. Recent blockbuster shows in the US, the UK, and Europe have explored how important patrons like Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (1459–1519), King Henry VIII of England (1491–1547), or the Habsburg kings of Spain commissioned armors of unprecedented visual splendor and technological complexity, and how such wearable art participated in performances of power. However, few exhibitions have focused on armorers' places at the centers of dynamic artistic networks, and compelling stories of communities renowned for the virtuosity of their smiths and luxury steel works they produced.",Dr. Chassica Kirchhoff,,,,,"Steel Towns: Armor, Artistry, and Innovation in the Renaissance",2025

A Century of Impact in California's Counties: Highlights from the University of California Cooperative archive features photographs from the California Agricultural Resources Archive (CARA), showcasing the University of California's work over the past 100 years to improve agricultural practices, support youth development, and promote broader civic engagement. The exhibit is divided into five themes: farm advisor demonstrations, crop trials, labor, home demonstration agents, and 4-H. Photographs illustrate the scope of work conducted by UC Cooperative Extension advisors. In the early years, farm advisors sought to create irrigation districts and fire protection districts; to direct road and infrastructure campaigns; and to demonstrate new techniques and technologies in agricultural production. In the ensuing decades, Cooperative Extension has administered extensive crop trials and has conducted copious research into farming practices and technologies. The first home demonstration agents in California taught rural women and girls about nutrition, food preservation techniques, and home economic skills like sewing and dressmaking. The involvement of youth in Cooperative Extension work was a precursor to the formation of 4-H clubs. Some of the images underscore major socioeconomic issues present in rural California like labor and immigration, irrevocably linked to farming and agriculture.

23600,GI-271448-20,"""Roman Landscapes: Visions of Nature and Myth from Rome and Pompeii"" is the first exhibition in the United States to explore landscape scenes as a striking new genre of ancient Roman art. These works depict a fascinating yet imaginary vision of a countryside dotted with seaside villas and rural shrines, where gods and mythological heroes mingle with travelers, herdsmen and worshippers. The exhibition features 66 wall paintings, sculptures, mosaics, and cameo glass and silver vessels created in Roman Italy between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250. ""Roman Landscapes"" is presented exclusively at the San Antonio Museum of Art and highlights works lent by museums in Italy, France, and Germany, many of which have never before been shown in the United States.   The exhibition introduces visitors to the cultural and archaeological contexts of Roman landscapes, beginning with paintings and sculptures from houses in Pompeii and nearby villas on the Bay of Naples that show how landscape scenes decorated lavish Roman residences and their gardens. Mural paintings and relief sculptures that depict coastal villas and rustic shrines display the imaginary aspects of Roman images of the natural world and connect the genre's appearance to the political and social upheaval of the late Republic and early Empire. Fantastical views of Egypt and Greece reflect ancient fascination with these celebrated lands incorporated into the Roman Empire. Mythological paintings then reveal landscape scenes as settings for hazardous encounters between humans and the gods. ""Roman Landscapes"" closes by comparing wall paintings from communal tombs in Rome with those from houses and exploring the adaptation of landscape imagery for funerary settings. The exhibition also highlights the artistic conventions that distinguish Roman landscape scenes, including their fluid, almost ""impressionistic"" brushwork and the use of bird's-eye perspective.",Jessica Powers,https://www.samuseum.org/artwork/exhibition/romanlandscapes/,San Antonio Museum of Art website,,,Roman Landscapes: Visions of Nature and Myth from Rome and Pompeii,2023

23811,ES-281190-21,"Peace is Patriotic   There is nothing like the smell of burning flesh. The smell enters your nose, but it lives on in your mouth as a gritty, acrid taste. I brushed my teeth a lot while I served in Iraq during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. I was there for only six months and one day, but there were times when I felt as if I was there for a lifetime. I lived and died there, but not like the burning bodies. They would never go home, or, maybe they already were home.    About the same time every year, I begin to have nightmares. By the time I wake up, I am aware that I have been dreaming. I hear the echo of my own screams. I cannot do anything to stop myself by then. I must live the day after my nightmares with the memory, or maybe residue, of my desert life.    That charred residue came home with me, burned in my memory, and in 2007 I curated a show with fellow veterans who served from Korea to Somalia to Afghanistan. In the show, we wanted to tell our war stories, and I came to use gunpowder as a means to express the power of the residue.    While an undergraduate student at the Maryland Institute College of Art, I lived with a Pekin duck. I made art about him constantly because he was such a character. It became easy for me to tell my stories of warfare and childhood war games, which in my dreams become commingled and at times inseparable. At some point, I found an old toy abandoned in an alley and used it in a composition, and now I usually use toys and ducks as visual elements representing aspects of me, those things that I do not share about my wartime experiences.    My pieces are lyrical abstractions, representations of what I experienced from the time I was a child until I woke up and worked on the final piece.",Julie Montione,,,,,"""Peace is Patriotic: A Veteran's Voice through Fire""",2022
