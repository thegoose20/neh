Historical themes include the Great Depression, 20th century political history, women's movements, and art in the 1930s. Materials were purchased, artifacts packed and moved to off-site storage; storage furniture was purchased, assembled and installed; artifacts were returned, stored, and location listed on the inventory. The new shelving increased the linear feet of storage from 202 to 505. The increased capacity made it possible to properly shelve and care for artifacts. Wooden platforms were replaced with properly-coated adjustable metal shelving.  This eliminated the harmful vapors from wood as well as the acid migration, so harmful to textiles and paper. Crowding was eliminated and artifacts were removed from boxes so they are accessible. Archival materials were placed in filing cabinets and books shelved. The ability to use and study the collection has improved. Location codes on each shelf make it possible to find any artifact. Labor for inventories before and after the move was provided by two graduate interns, Steffany Hagler and Allison Eaton. After the project, Ms. Hagler was hired as a curator at the Museum of Florida History and Ms Eaton was hired by the National Archives.

Apparently unrecorded, The Queen of the Night is rather archly credited to ""the author of ‘One thousand popular tales'""—a reference to a book title, or to one of the ultra-prolific dime novel writers of the time? The Queen of the Night reveals for us the highs and lows of life in ""wicked New York."" It begins at Sing-Sing, where remorseful convict Whiskie is breaking rocks, only to encounter his former partner in crime, the manipulative, cold-blooded gang leader Slippery Blacksmith. Whiskie resists Slippery's unrefusable offer, only to die—or so Slippery thinks, before he breaks out of Sing-Sing. Months later, a freed Whiskie has reinvented himself as ""Hugh Mortimer,"" a gentleman in pursuit of Gretchen, a wealthy young resident of fashionable Fifth Avenue. But the ""Queen of the Night,"" who shines in the most select social circles as easily as she dominates the New York underworld, conspires with Slippery to turn Whiskie's designs to their own advantage. Many lurid plot twists later, Whiskie casts his nemeses into a watery grave and marries the still-undefiled Gretchen. Purchased from Peter Luke.

The soldier from home offers a fascinating contemporary perspective on the topic of postal communication with soldiers—all the more important today because of the mass of surviving correspondence and the numerous edited compilations being published during this sesquicentennial period. Waterbury first outlines the mundane details of camp life and the routines of sending and receiving mail, thus enabling those at home to visualize more clearly the importance of letters in soldiers' daily lives. He then offers pointers on what to write, the effect that letters have on their recipients, dealing with the uncertainty caused by lost letters, preparing for receipt of the dreaded letter addressed in an unknown hand and bearing a black seal, and the solace to be derived from reading what one now knows to be ""the last letter.""

Significant topics represented in this collection include working  women of Finnish ethnicity, and mid-20th century boarding house kitchens.  The materials are original photographic prints, probably dating at or near the 1952 date of the photo shoot. The Broadway Dining Room in Finntown was also known as Riipi's Boarding House. Edward Riipi sold the property and the business after his wife Hilma's death in 1947. The property was sold to the Anaconda Company in July of 1966. Butte's established Finninsh community continues to refer to the location and the business as ""Riipi's"".","Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives, 17 West Quartz Street, Butte, Montana 59701",Ellen Crain,Broadway Dinning Room Collection,http://buttearchives.pastperfectonline.com,,,,2020

Workshop participants were residents of Butte and Missoula, Montana.  Significant topics represented in this collection are the predominance of Mexican immigrants in Butte's Hispanic community; migration and immigration stories of Mexican families coming to the United States; agricultural and mining employment; Mexican Catholic religious traditions; Mexican and Hispanic cuisine; and community ties between Butte.   The contents of this collection are primarily visual and auditory, and are present solely in MP3, MP4, and JPEG digital formats. Additional materials are textual, and are available in JPEG or PDF formats.

18754,FN-266278-19,"This collection documents storytelling and conversations with speakers of Quechua (quh) in rural highlands Chuquisaca, Bolivia in the communities surrounding Tarabuco town, home of the Yampara culture and celebrated as a World Heritage Site. A small degree of Quechua monolingualism is still preserved there. This collection began in 2016 with 25 interviews of adults and continued in 2018 with 58 interviews of children as well as the making of a short film in which children and community leaders presented theater, a game and songs. In 2019 we conducted two free-form narrative interviews of adults. All collection media were video-recorded, transcribed in Quechua and translated to Spanish by indigenous Bolivian researchers in collaboration with North American linguists. Chuquisaca lies near the southern extreme of the linguistic area that produced Standard Colonial Quechua (quz/quh). Movement of people between Cuzco and Chuquisaca accelerated in the 16th century due to silver mining in Potosí. Cuzco Quechua is the international prestige variety which has been documented for over 500 years, whereas Bolivian varieties have rarely received attention (Durston 2007, Mannheim 1991). Quechua is now ‘definitely endangered' in the communities where we conducted this collection of interviews, as intergenerational transmission is increasingly abandoned in favor of Spanish. This collection is an extension of our team's first efforts, found at AILLA in The Speech of Children from Cuzco and Chuquisaca. In that collection, interviews conducted in Chuquisaca were limited to sentence comprehension and picture description tasks. The elicitation instruments we used here include a series of drawings about a duck and an Andean goose developed by our team, as well as a book of drawings adapted from Mercer Mayer's Frog Stories which have been used for studies of languages around the world.

The abundance of copies produced in so many places over 1,000 years testifies to the importance of Islamic-world cartographic visions.  Al-Khwarizmi's map of the Nile became a model for depicting the river in nearly every cartographic manuscript for centuries.  Nasuh's cartographically illustrated histories could be described as the first attempt at 3D.  Together, all of the maps produced over this unfathomably long era share one thing in common: They were made on the basis of sketches, accounts and myths; views from hills, mountains and the masts of ships; supplemented by tradition on the one hand and carefully accumulated data from increasingly sophisticated navigational and geometric tools on the other. Although these maps do not display the forms of the world in the way ours do today, modern atlases and GPS maps turn out to have much in common with the maps in this calendar: Systems of shapes, lines, labels, patterns and colors all help us understand the world and invite us to explore it.",AramcoWorld,"Karen Pinto, Alva Robinson",2020 Calendar: Exploring Islamic Maps,https://www.aramcoworld.com/Articles/November-2019/2020-Calendar-Maps,2020 Calendar pdf available for download.
