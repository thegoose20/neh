		<Abstract>Representatives of the German Archaeological Institute and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens convened in Athens and Corinth for four days (November 4-7) to discuss problems in information technology as they pertain to the so-called "Big Digs," that is, excavations like Ancient Corinth, the Athenian Agora, Olympia, and the Kerameikos.  The purpose of the gathering was to explore opportunities for collaboration between American and German archaeologists. This initial workshop was made possible through a generous grant from the DFG/NEH Bilateral Digital Humanities Program in reponse to a proposal: "The ‘Big Digs' Go Digital: Opportunities and Challenges for Large-Scale, Multigenerational Excavation Projects in the Digital Age." The 30 representatives from the two institutions included directors of the German and American schools in Athens, the General Secretary of the DAI in Berlin, and the head of ASCSA's Committee on Information Technology. Greek colleagues, Metaxia Tsipopoulou, Director, National Archives of Monuments of Greece, and Despina Tsiafaki, Head of Cultural Heritage United, CETI, participated in the discussions.  A second workshop will take place at the Annual Meetings of the Archaeological Institute of America in Anaheim, California (January 7, 2010)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Given the explosion of scholarship in cultural history over the past twenty-five years, what now is the place of objects in the study of the past? What role do material and visual culture studies play in scholarly conversations that range over topics as diverse as race, sexuality, gender, nationalism, ethnicity, power and global interaction? In turn, in the face of increasingly trans-national scholarship in early America what can we gain from attention paid to a single region and its artifacts? &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through the emergence of women's studies programs in academic institutions in the past generation or two, many aspects of women's lives have been documented through publications and academic courses. The third conference of the Center for Historic American Visual Culture focuses not on women but on men. Looking at examples of visual materials of and for men is a way to look at a different gendered audience. In the literature on American graphic materials, little has been written about the audience for historical images. The papers presented at this conference begin to address this need.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One question that often surfaces about historical prints is the accuracy of images. Did makers of nineteenth-century city view portray cities as they actually were? Do history prints present myths or truth? How often did print publishers gloss over reality to present heroism or an optimistic view of society? The Fourth CHAViC Conference seeks to address some of these questions among others. The presentations by scholars from a variety of disciplines addressed American identity consumption of historical prints, reform prints, artistic license, the exchange of imagery between America and Europe, the distribution of urban imagery on Staffordshire pottery, and presidential portraiture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To tackle increasingly large digitized archives of text, the digital humanities community has responded with an avid interest in text mining and visualization. Everywhere one looks these days, computer scientists are bringing text analysis to humanities scholars with tutorials, workshops, and toolkits. Nevertheless, crucial information is being lost in translation. If text analysis toolkits are to be truly successful, information needs to start flowing the other way and computer scientists must learn from humanities scholars what humanistic text analysis really means. If not, they will continue making "natural" assumptions that do not always translate into the humanities. For example, concepts like "question", "hypothesis", "data", "evidence" are always well-defined in scholars' minds and are universal to all analysis. In the extreme case, this misalignment of basic assumptions could lead to fleets of powerful text analysis tools that nobody knows how to actually apply to humanistic analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"One of the goals of the Five Tribes Story Conference is to establish a sense of family among participants and attendees until the rolls are blurred" stated Co-host Tim Tingle in his opening remarks. The intent of the conference was to merge practice and theory in the interpretation of folklore, oral tradition, scholarship and literature of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole Tribes. The goal was to provide an enriching Southeastern Tribal environment, joining academic, interpretive, literary, art and performance disciplines. Cultural presentations, literary readings and panel discussions were followed by questions from the audience. The Five Tribes Story Conference serves as an inspirational springboard for working and future writers, poets, film-makers, painters and musicians. In addition to enjoying the visual arts, attendees had the opportunity to hear "stories-behind-the-stories" told by modern heroes of the Indian world. Evening concerts were a strong reflection of the conference goals by including authors, poets, musicians, language instructors, and storytellers portraying their common pursuit of conveying the Five Tribes stories. Ideas discussed during the day were brought to life with the evening performances.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This public policy forum aimed at understanding the interconnected and multiple historical, policy, and biopolitical dimensions of water politics. Accordingly, humanities scholars from History and Political Science examined the influence of water on the development of society in the Southwest of the United States. Following this historical assemblage of water as it unfolded within a regional and local setting, the program then focused on water from a policy perspective taking into account the relevant regional, national, and global context. In this phase of the forum, then, political scientists discussed the policy framework that governs the use of water at the national level and among the states in the United States. Acknowledging that the politics of water transcends borders, the policy dimension of water concluded with a focus on the role of international organizations in shaping a global water governance structure. Finally, the lecture portion of the program concluded with a discussion on the relationship between the quality of life and the sustainable availability of clean water in Oklahoma.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Held over the course of three days, the conference took place on the Kenyon campus in Gambier, Ohio, and involved broad student, faculty, and campus participation. The conference included public panels and private discussions, with participants from a variety of fields: journalists, academics from a variety of disciplines, political actors, policy analysts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations involved in the work of democratization. Panels looked at the political, economic, and social aspects of democracy, as well as how or to what extent the promotion of democracy coheres with the principles and values of the United States. While recent developments in the Middle East made the conference topic timely, panelists considered a broad spectrum of regions and questions, including:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; What are the prospects for democracy in the Middle East, after the Arab Spring?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Is it in America's national security interest to promote democracy abroad?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; What can we learn from experiences with democracy promotion outside the Middle East?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; What are the underpinnings or prerequisites of successful liberal democracies?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; What are the practical impediments to the further spread of democracy?&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper speaks to what some in American Indian Studies have suggested is the Native Atlantic world, or the Atlantic world through Native eyes.  It demonstrates how during the Early Modern Period, American Indians were exploring and redefining their status as "subjects of the crown" in an increasingly violent colonial world, eventually leveraging that status against the colonies' reckless land policies.  &amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D; Such a perspective has resulted in some interesting questions.  For example, if the Indians' rights as subjects depended on the crown's prerogative, what happened to those rights when the king was removed?  How did the Indians understand the Restoration?  How were American colonial Indian policies responding to the changes before, during, and after the English civil war?  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The answer to these questions reveals a fairly unexplored dynamic between government officials at Whitehall, their American colonial counterparts, and Native tribal leaders in New England.  I will address the foundations of that dynamic from its beginnings at the start of the 17th century through crucial subsequent developments which survived two wars – the English civil war and the New England Native conflict commonly known as King Philip's War (1675-76) – culminating in 1704, when the Mohegans brought their complaint against the Colony of Connecticut to Queen Anne's Privy Council.  Thus, the paper explores early American Indian policies not only at Whitehall but in colonial and tribal power centers in New England, sometimes with surprising observations.  &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Institute of American Indian Arts was awarded a grant by the National Endowment for the Humanities, which culminated in two multi-disciplinary courses for both the Museum Studies and New Media Arts departments. These courses teach students how to 3-D scan cultural objects with laser scanning and photogrammetry techniques. The possibilities through the application of these two techniques for tribal institutions and communities are amazing and ground-breaking, and should be embraced with some care and diligence. For although it will allow our objects to "return" to the communities from which they emerged in order to be utilized in a variety of educational and cultural ways, the dissemination of this data must be carefully guarded as well. This panel will first present the amazing work that the IAIA students have done in scanning the IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts' collection pieces, and then will move into a heart-felt discussion on the issues and concerns on how these and other technologies could have upon our cultural property rights. We look forward to fully sharing the 3D scanning techniques in a pre-conference workshop at the IAIA campus, and then we hope to dialogue together in order to be prepared to utilize technology within our own uniquely strong and knowledgeable culturally-based philosophies and ethics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The twelfth-century Samguk sagi contains annals for all three early Korean kingdoms beginning with their putative foundations in the first century BCE. Yet the evidence of both earlier Chinese histories and peninsular archaeology indicate that the two southernmost of the polities, Silla and Paekche, did not develop as royal states until the fourth century. Consequently, as complimentary as the presumed antiquity of these two kingdoms may have been, it also had the effect of creating an initial void of over three hundred and fifty years in their actual histories.&amp;#x0D; The editors of the Samguk sagi evidently made use of several different strategies to fill the historiographic voids created by the impossibly early foundation dates that they credited to the two southern kingdoms in particular—for instance, the insertion of accounts of celestial phenomena extracted from China's dynastic histories, including some that could not have been observed anywhere in Korea. Many of the Samguk sagi's anachronistic entries possess, however, a persuasive "ring" of credibility, exhibiting compelling indicators of historicity such as the inclusion of specific personal names, ranks and places. The entries in this last group have the hallmarks of being antedated reports of bona fide events from the original accounts of the kingdoms.&amp;#x0D; In my presentation, I briefly explain the basic elements of the methodology whereby I rectify the anachronistic dating of entries in the Samguk sagi and then illustrate the virtue of the methodology by applying it to several anomalous entries from the annals of that text.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We set up the real-time auralization at the Acoustical Society of America's Spring 2014 meeting in Providence, RI and ran a six-hour listening session where people could come and listen and interact with the simulation. I gave three 30-minute talks about the project (one every two hours), and the remaining time was dedicated to listening. Well over 100 people came to experience the simulation during the day. All the chairs in the main listening area were full for each talk with overflow to the sides, so at least 90 were in attendance for the talks alone. Several people sat and listened for over an hour, which was wonderful to see.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The concept of ‘the Gregorian Reform', as conceived about a century ago and still in use, interprets the various currents of ecclesiastical reform emerging between the 1040s and 1120s as a unitary project which, after a period of preparation, found its execution and full realization under Gregory VII (1073-1085). These presentations place this reading in dialogue with an alternative interpretation—advanced chiefly by Italian, German, and American historians—that understands reform as a complex, polyvalent phenomenon.  Multi-directional and influenced by many individuals -- distinct in their interests, experiences and ideals -- only with time and struggle did the reform reach any eventual synthesis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Just as medieval reformers sought to critique, inspire, and transform through the written and spoken word, so they mobilized artistic media as well as iconography to express their message.  Yet, the relationship between art and intellectual and institutional developments is rarely simple and programmatic. After an initial contribution that evaluates methodologically scholarship linking artistic production and reform during the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the remaining papers explore in depth two examples of the complex nexus of artistic expression, reform, and power as it manifested itself in the ecclesiastical sculpture of northern Italian churches and in the fresco programs of the Vatican</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How is the reformer's imagination nourished and their energies mobilized?  This panel explores the diverse ways in which lived (or imagined) experience combined with texts to challenge, transform, and re-stabilize religious life and structures. Through examinations of how Lateran canons asserted their vital role in the liturgical life of the Eternal City, the impetus to reform provided by an account of a journey to the East, and the systematic recording of the lives and legends of Francscan ‘local heroes', panelists explore the essential role of "textualized experience" in both articulating and institutionally anchoring visions of a better Christianity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Reform often involves changes in beliefs and practices but a critical component to promote and establish such changes is the physical environment in which such changes occur and which can support (or undermine) reform initiatives. This panel explores the role of the physical, and particularly the built, environment in the expression and establishment of reform in medieval Italy between the seventh and 14th centuries. Furthermore, it does so at three scales: the individual church (Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome); the urban ecclesiastical fabric (Ravenna); and Franciscan female houses of San Silvestro in Capite and San Lorenzo in Panisperna in Rome.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although the language of reform can often lead to a perception of homogeneity and stability, closer examination of instances of reform reveals not only difference and dynamism within movements, but also significant change within the agents of reform themselves. The papers in this panel explore three distinct modes of personal "evolution" in the eleventh and twelfth centuries: in the case of Peter Damian, physical relocation and the redirection of reforming energy; in the works of Hildegard of Bingen, changing approaches to combining text, sound, and image; and with Nicholas Maniacutia, the reorientation of text-critical sensibilities towards a new object, namely the Vulgate.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Inequality of Opportunity" &amp;#x0D; •Robert Putnam, Harvard University&amp;#x0D; •Introduced by Max Rappoport ('14)  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In his Wall Street Journal (April 15, 2014) column, "A Bipartisan Consensus on Income Inequality?" William Galston thoughtfully summarized Robert Putnam's speech.  He wrote that Putnam "spoke movingly about the differences between growing up in securely middle-class families and in families living on the edge of poverty." &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Galston added:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; "It was impossible to come away from Mr. Putnam's talk believing that America's children enjoy anything like equal opportunity to succeed.  But one could have reached a similar conclusion—and many did—from Charles Murray's 2012 book Coming Apart, which chronicled the decline of the white working class. Messrs. Murray and Putnam disagree on both diagnosis and prescription: Mr. Murray emphasizes cultural change as a reason for the decline, Mr. Putnam the collapse of the industrial economy. But on the level of describing the gap between top and bottom—qualitative and quantitative—they largely agree. In a country that cares about opportunity, that agreement matters."&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This talk was the most popular of all the conference sessions</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One essential approach in preserving architectural heritage is the documentation of 3D geometries and surface textures of historic buildings. For example, precise colour information, excluding lighting effects, is an intrinsic property of the surface materials of building interiors and exteriors. However, while colour information has been recorded for small sample areas, it has not been accurately documented on the scale of entire building surfaces. This is critical, because building materials decay and their colours fade with time. The goal of this project is to develop a method to assist in recording and documenting the chromatic information of interiors and exteriors of historic buildings with low cost and high efficiency. The method takes advantage of emerging high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) technology, which can store rich information about colour and illumination through digital photography. By recording the colour information, in addition to the geometry and texture information obtained through other existing technologies, we can achieve more complete documentation for architectural heritage. In this paper, we discuss an overview of the problem and present our algorithms for utilizing computer vision techniques to retrieve chromatic information of historic buildings. We also present and discuss our experiments and results of applying our method to studies of lab objects and the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City, Beijing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The digital age opens film history both to newer tools and the challenges of statistics. One such tool is Cinemetrics, a sizable database of shot lengths that enables users to amass and process numeric data related to film editing. The one-day conference "A Numerate Film History?" is about the possible promises—or traps—that emerge as a result of the encounter between century-old films and the computational statistics of today. Conducted under the aegis of the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society and co-sponsored by the Film Studies Center, the conference features Professor Tom Gunning and Professor Yuri Tsivian from Cinema and Media Studies at the University of Chicago and two Neubauer Collegium Visiting Fellows: Michael Baxter, Emeritus Professor of Statistical Archaeology, Nottingham Trent University, UK and Daria Khitrova, Visiting Assistant Professor, University of California, Los Angeles.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Health and Disease in the Middle Ages" was a five-week Seminar for College and University Teachers held June 24-July 28, 2012, in London, England. Based at the Wellcome Library—the world's premier research center for medical history—this Seminar gathered scholars from across the disciplines interested in questions of health, disease, and disability in medieval Europe. Support for this Seminar came from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies (ACMRS).  We explored how the new scientific technologies of identifying pathogens (particularly leprosy and plague) could inform traditional, humanistic methods (historical, literary, art historical, and linguistic) of understanding cultural responses to disease and disability. Reciprocally, we also explored how traditional, humanistic studies of medieval medicine could inform modern scientific studies of disease, which were developing at a rapid pace thanks to new methods of DNA retrieval and analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ABSTRACT: Philosophers of religion have recently argued that second-personal narratives can be an effective theodical tool to defend divine perfection against the problem of evil. What it means to suffer, for example, is best conveyed by a second-personal standpoint, and narratives are able to connote this meaning in a way which resists propositional form.1 Critics—especially atheist feminist proponents of a secularized concept of ‘evil'—contend that theists can never successfully use narrative as a defense against the problem of evil because Scripture fails to speak to those who truly suffer from (especially) atrocious harms, and the narratives are never spoken by them since all of the narrators within the biblical text are men.2 Theologians have been particularly keen to show that narratives can produce theological knowledge3, but this paper will argue that philosophy's theodical use of narrative accounts can bridge the gap between the atrocious harm arguments of contemporary atheists and the epistemic function of theology's second-person standpoint. A caution will be given to philosophers, however: Although the project of utilizing narrative as a way to do theodicy should be preserved, this paper will cast doubt on the ability of second-personal narratives to effectively answer the criticisms elicited by the atrocity paradigm, and will instead suggest that a first-person epistemic standpoint can better rescue narrative as a theodical tool.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Music for Youth and Pequot Library presented Brian Torff and the New Duke Ensemble at their Young Persons' Concert Series on Oct 24th The room was full of enthusiastic Jazz students from local Middle and High schools. Students also came from the Greater Bridgeport Youth Orchestra Jazz Band. It was a wonderful afternoon of music with Brian leading us through the evolution of his original compositions and giving us a history of jazz and blues. The program continued with a master class featuring student ensembles and soloists who were able to get one on one and small group sectional support. The artists enthusiastically reached out to each student giving them guidance, technical support and professional coaching. The students were grateful for this unique opportunity. The master class program ended with all students learning and jamming the C Jam Blues with New Duke Ensemble. It was the perfect way to end the master class. We appreciated the opportunity to feature Brian Torff and the New Duke Ensemble at our Young Persons' Concert Series and can't thank the band enough for their wonderful work with our master class students.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cuban graphic designer Conrado Massaguer's promotional advertisement, featuring a voluptuous Cuban woman holding maracas and boasting the slogan, "So near and yet so foreign," was utilized by the Cuban Tourist Commission in a promotion to its U.S. neighbors in the 1950s. Today, the messages in the&amp;#x0D; promotion are ironically prescient. Normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba has yielded heightened interest among U.S. citizens and already throngs of American tourists have traveled to Cuba, many of whom aim to experience Cuba "before it changes." But what will shape their experience? Contemporary theories of tourism embrace the concept of a "tourist gaze" as&amp;#x0D; the performative, embodied practices of being a tourist, which are focused on the visual, as well as other sensorial experiences. This panel seeks to address the understudied, though integral, role that design plays in tourism practices. From promotional visual material, to luggage design, to "indigenous" crafts, to hotel furniture and landscaping, how does design mediate the tourist experience? How does design normalize the tourist's life back home by creating an experience of an other? Likewise, how does design offer a space for locals to exert agency in negotiating their&amp;#x0D; representation? How does design interrogate the dichotomies that are negotiated in touristic experiences--near/far, familiar/foreign, inclusive/exclusive, comfort/discomfort, authentic/inauthentic? Papers may explore the ways in which design, as experienced by any or all of the senses, has either perpetuated the stereotypes of otherness or has contradicted and counteracted these stereotypes.</Abstract>

The twenty-first century technological explosion has also increased the availability of theatrical records and commentaries, encouraging us to contemplate how pedagogy is changing, and how online resources such as Somerset and MacLean's pioneering REED Patrons and Performances database may be used by wider communities to reflect on the early Shakespearean stage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the Writing Our Lives-Digital Ubuntu conference students shared original works in formats ranging from TED Talks and web mapping to written pieces published on WordPress or BlogSpot. "The projects were outstanding," noted Crandall. "It was a day where students shared their writing beyond traditional classroom boundaries. They wrote radio plays and political speeches. They designed talks for the stage and stories about their neighborhoods. More importantly, they interacted with young people from other zip codes and questioned the stereotypes of one another's community. Young people have a tremendous amount of power when writing together."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A Conference to be held at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and the McNeil Center for Early American Studies of the University of Pennsylvania&amp;#x0D; [February 8-9, 2017]&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Emancipations, Reconstructions, and Revolutions seeks to gather historians of US politics and African-American life to consider collectively not whether African Americans participated in the politics of the early, ante- and post-bellum republic, but how, when, and with what lasting effects.  It will bring together various historiographical revisions now in process, including the recognition that the Civil War and Reconstruction typify rather than divide the middle period of American history.  We are on the cusp of a new understanding of our national origins, seeing the American Revolution as a violent civil war shaped in large part by slavery and black participation. The Revolutionary settlement of half-slave and half-free thus defines a first Emancipation and first Reconstruction, part of a single "long" process beginning in the North and culminating in the South. We believe that our understanding of modern African American and U.S. politics will be fruitfully renovated by rethinking prior emancipations and reconstructions, in ways that do not take for granted the nature and outcomes of revolutions that could easily be described as civil wars followed by reconstructions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Project Andvari is an international collaborative project designed to create a digital portal that will provide integrated access to collections of northern European art and artifacts of the fourth through twelfth centuries. The project title Andvari evokes many features of this new research tool. Andvari (Old Norse ‘the careful one') is the name of a dwarf in Norse mythology, where dwarves are associated with arts and crafts. Andvari is the collector of a great treasure and a shape-shifter. Thus his character echoes the idea of a digital portal functioning as an aggregator and its utility in searching artistic elements transformed across media, regions, and cultures.&amp;#x0D; The goal of this presentation is to explain the rationale for and the objectives of Project Andvari. Despite the wealth of the surviving visual culture from early medieval Scandinavia and neighboring areas, primary materials are often difficult to access, scattered in specialized, national collections. Researchers working on artifacts in one medium are often unaware of parallels in another and use different terminology to describe similar elements. Recently, several collections of material restricted by medium, object type, or location have been made available through online catalogues, but these subsets have remained unconnected. Furthermore, the search functions of existing databases are often limiting since they pre-structure material in conventional categories dictated by scholarly traditions.&amp;#x0D; In response to these challenges, Project Andvari will facilitate interdisciplinary research in the northern periphery of medieval Europe, allowing users to study visual culture across media and beyond traditional geographical and disciplinary boundaries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The presentation offered a new understanding of the effects of World War I on Russian women by examining relief to victims of the war on the home front, particularly the system of state allowances paid to the wives and families of soldiers. The provision of war-related relief emancipated and radicalized both the upper- and middle-class women who administered the system, and the soldiers' wives they interacted with.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Session 1631&amp;#x0D; Title:          Stanford's NEH-Funded Global Currents: Feature Modelling and the Medieval Manuscripts &amp;#x0D; Abstract:    The NEH-funded project, Stanford Global Currents, is part of an international team of scholars using visual language processing and feature modelling to determine the characteristics of information retrieval tools in a broad corpora of texts. At Stanford, we are focused on a large number of (long) 12th-century English manuscripts and the ways in which Latin, English, and French text is presented through a range of genres and qualities of production; that is, we focus on the characteristics of 100,000 examples of mise-en-page as displayed through network modelling. We hope to reveal exciting new results at Leeds, including the datability of   litterae notabiliores ; the consistency and localisation of the deployment of rubrics and intertextual space; the relative significance of types of enlarged capitals; and a typology of manuscript decoration from c. 1080 to 1220. &amp;#x0D; Sponsor:    Stanford Text Technologies &amp;#x0D; Organiser   Elaine Treharne, Department of English, Stanford University &amp;#x0D; Moderator/Chair   Mark Algee-Hewitt, Department of English, Stanford University&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Paper -a  The Display of Manuscript Data (Language: English) &amp;#x0D; Speaker:  Ben Albritton, Center for Medieval &amp;amp; Early Modern Studies, Stanford University &amp;#x0D; Indexing Terms:   Computing in Medieval Studies, Manuscripts and Palaeography&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Paper -b          Managing Manuscripts (Language: English) &amp;#x0D; Speaker:          Celena Allen, Center for Spatial &amp;amp; Textual Analysis (CESTA), Stanford University &amp;#x0D; Indexing Terms:   Manuscripts and Palaeography, Technology &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Paper -c          Deductive and Inductive Research in Big Data Manuscript Studies (Language: English) &amp;#x0D; Speaker:          Matt Aiello, Worcester College, University of Oxford &amp;#x0D; Indexing Terms:   Computing in Medieval Studies, Manuscripts and Palaeography</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cosponsored professional development day for New York City public high school teachers. The daylong event explored the meaning of historical literacy and examined inquiry-based teaching models for the high school classroom. Presentations by scholars, open dialogue with event participants, and breakout sessions addressed the construction of the American historical narrative, archival research and the politics of the historical record, and how historical literacy matters as a foundation for the development of engaged civic participation in learners.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While many social studies and language arts teachers use close reading strategies with documents to develop historical thinking, traditional texts often serve as a barrier for students who struggle with reading, particularly non-native English speakers or students with language-based learning disabilities. In this workshop, practicing classroom teachers learned how to develop historical thinking skills through the analysis of historical buildings. Drawing on literacy theory and practice, the workshop demonstrated how the process of historical building analysis supports students' development of higher order thinking skills and meets Common Core State Standards.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Given all the work that has been done on the subject in the last decade, that &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; there was an Islamo-Mediterranean culture is undeniable. To mention but a few &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; examples because there are too many to mention. See, for instance, the work of &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Brian Catlos, Karla Mallette, Sarah Secord-Davis, Jessica Goldberg, Olivia Remie &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Constable, and other participants of this workshop. What all this research has &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; proven in agreement with Braudel, Goitein, and the other yea-saying scholars of &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; yore is that they were right to see the Mediterranean as a region of intense &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; cultural encounters religious, architectural, textual, mythological, navigational &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; and otherwise. From tinkers, tailors, soldiers, sailors, traders, travelers, &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; pilgrims, crusaders, and other folk, we hear story upon story of one &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Mediterranean Encounter after another.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1897, anthropologist Franz Boas published The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians, a synthesis of his initial research on the Northwest Coast with materials authored by his Indigenous collaborator, George Hunt. Although highly influential, the monograph remained incomplete and fractured, and extensive archival materials relating to its origins and afterlives were scattered across two continents. This seminar will bring together an international team whose aim is to synthesize historic and contemporary ethnographic data with community perspectives in three overlapping realms: 1) the incorporation of Kwakwaka'wakw cultural ontology into the project's metadata structure and content; 2) a set of research questions that cross sub-disciplinary boundaries and forms of ethnographic media; and, 3) the suitability for publication of potentially sensitive ceremonial and genealogical materials. This is an unprecedented effort within anthropology and the humanities, promising new ways of using ethnography and digital media to link together disparate archives, museums, textual repositories, and contemporary Native communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In November 2014, as part of a ‘double act' with another senior poetic Latinist, from Oxford, I made an invited research visit to the University of Campinas in São Paulo Province, Brazil, one of the major centers of a recent nationwide expansion in Brazilian Classics, for a two-day event on poetic intertextuality in which we each gave two papers and offered consultations to the department's graduate students about international contexts for their research.  My hosts had just completed a research project on the early 19th century translation of Virgil's Aeneid into Brazilian Portuguese by Odorico Mendes, a founding event for the establishment of transatlantic Portuguese as a language with an identity and prestige separable from its European counterpart.  This was an apt project for the growing Campinas department, in which, even now, a characteristic MA assignment is to produce an annotated translation of an ancient work not previously translated into Brazilian Portuguese, both as a kind of advanced basic training in Classics and as a visionary attempt to restore ancient Greek and Latin texts to the mainstream of modern Brazilian learned literary culture; the PhD assignment, after the MA, adds a research monograph to complete a published ‘package'.  A week spent hovering between Latin, English and (through interpreters) Portuguese was fascinating in itself and as living context for my own research project on Poetry across Languages; and, unexpectedly, the Campinas team turned out to be the ideal audience for my work in progress on Wordsworth's Aeneid.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk explored some of the awareness, thinking and competencies that the global citizen of today needs in general. It touched on the aspects that all of us need to reflect on as we design or make decisions everyday about technology- care and justice in its design and use.  Starting with a definition of care, the talk articulated some properties - complexity, systems, interdependence - of the technological systems that we have come to depend upon and how we could design, use and spread these with care and justice for a sustainable world.  A call for reflection on the role of technology and science in today's living, in our thinking, and how to do it with care in our individual dealings and how care at this level is a pre-requisite to global justice in the deployment of technology.  The primary purpose of this reflection was to consider whether we are asking the right questions, solving the right problems, and bringing the right perspectives, starting from our various disciplinary points of view.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Mitcham discussed "What is "appropriate" about appropriate technology?" The question requires more than a technological or engineering response. The abbreviation of "appropriate technology" (AT) can also be read as "alternative technology." The second reading suggests a more radical approach to the same think about what we are doing as we replace the natural with the built environment and turn the world into an artifact. It is thus useful to consider the dialogue between these two terms - using two approaches to one particular kind of technology, energy technology. Whether and to what extent we can develop an appropriate or an alternative energy technology will be crucial to the kind of world-artifact we will construct. This contrast will further distinguish two approaches to an ethical assessment of energy: Type I energy ethics is grounded in a belief that increases in energy production and use are both humanizing and civilizing; Type II energy ethics questions this belief and argues that beyond a certain point, energy production and use become counterproductive. Our technological way of life is currently determined by Type I energy ethics, although Type II energy ethics deserves a hearing. A provocative illustration of the Type II approach to energy will reference energy ethics and policy in China. In the end, a case for the pursuit not just of an appropriate technology but an alternative technology and way of life was made.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The results and evaluations of the first course were presented to the NEH Convergence group and any interested professors.  Materials used in the first interdisciplinary course were presented and discussed so that the participants could utilize the materials in their courses, if applicable.  The results indicated that the students prefer to meet with all of the professors in all of the class meetings. They found meeting with the professors separately, did not demonstrate nor support the goals of the project or course. For this reason, one-third way through the course, then professors met with all of the students for all of the class meetings.  In addition to the originally planned seminar, the course team members added information on the results and evaluations of the first team-taught course offered under the NEH grant.</Abstract>

The enduring questions examined were: Is the brain a Turing machine? Can the paradoxes and apparent contradictions of human thought be explained in the light of Godel's theorem? When the limits of electronic computers are reached, can quantum computers offer the solution to many the current shortcomings of artificial intelligence? Will (or can) consciousness emerge from computing machines?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Research and discussion on the creation of interdisciplinary courses began the first cycle of seminars in order to prepare the participants for creating and offering their own interdisciplinary courses.  Dr. Carolyn Haynes, consultant of the Integrative Studies Association, gave a two day seminar (The Creation and Development of Interdisciplinary Courses) on the elements of interdisciplinary studies in 25-26 February 2012.  This seminar was attended by all participating faculty members, as well as interested faculty from across the disciplines.  In this seminar, Dr. Haynes led the participants in an investigation of how an interdisciplinary context could be employed at UPRM.&amp;#x0D; The principal topics discussed in this seminar were: &amp;#x0D; •basic design of interdisciplinary courses&amp;#x0D; •design of assignments or the courses&amp;#x0D; •methods for evaluation of the courses&amp;#x0D; •possible obstacles confronted by those interested in working in an interdisciplinary context&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; During the course of the seminar, the participants worked in cross-disciplinary groups on various mini-projects to aid them in designing topics and materials for interdisciplinary research.  These cross-disciplinary groups included faculty members from the Humanities, the Sciences, and Engineering fields.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the seminar for the UPRM community, Dr. Pfister discussed the use of evolution and ecology to  provide students with important life skills in regard to being informed global citizens. In this workshop he explored how it is that historical topics around early evolution debates set the stage for present day concepts and presentations. Using a course that was developed for the General Education program at Harvard University, we examined the way in which an integrated presentation (with literature, biology, and history) can lead students to broaden their views about the world in which they live and relate to their studies outside particular fields.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The seminar Alternative and Appropriate Technologies: Technology for Whom? Technology for What? provided an interactive discussion of the philosophical, engineering, and technological aspects of alternative and appropriate technologies, as well as the methods and assessment results from the class. In particular, the workshop explored key motivating exercises conducted in the class,  What Appropriate Technology means and how to build a course around this topic; how interdisciplinary inquiry ranging from philosophy to technical literacy was incorporated  to critically examine Appropriate  Technology; the interdisciplinary skills developed by students, ranging from writing critiques in essay form to estimating physical quantities; and the transformational experiences expressed by both students and faculty.  The workshop was particularly useful to the following audiences: Faculty interested in teaching interdisciplinary general education courses, Faculty seeking to enrich their disciplinary courses with interdisciplinary methods, Administrators supportive  of interdisciplinary general  education courses. All concerned with how technology impacts society, quality of life, and wellbeing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr.  George Coyne, S.J., Professor Emeritus of Le Moyne College in Syracuse, NY presented a seminar on cosmology and belief to the UPRM Community.  This seminar focused on the philosophical and interdisciplinary aspects of cosmology. Emphasis was given to an analysis of what is the cosmos and the interdisciplinary connections between evolution, cosmology, and belief systems .  Dr.  Coyne is a world-wide recognized authorities on cosmology and is a former director of the Vatican Observatory and one of the leading scholars articulating a relationship between natural sciences and theology.  He belongs to a group that sustains that natural sciences and religions are complementary and not in conflict. However, a possible dialogue between these two sources of knowledge raises some questions and it was these questions that were examined in the faculty and UPRM Seminars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During this seminar Dr. George Coyne, S.J., addressed the issue of how what we know from science about the evolution of life in the universe influences our religious attitudes and to what extent can religious thought contributes to our scientific understanding of the origins and evolution of life in the universe. This twofold question poses the serious risk of transgressing upon the epistemological independence of the various disciplines: theology, philosophy, astrophysics, biology and cosmology, and creating, thereby, more confusion than understanding. Therefore, it is that possible to establish a fruitful dialogue between natural sciences, philosophy and faith? What are the conditions that render possible such interdisciplinary dialogue? From the religious side this dialogue must be limited to the rational foundations for religious belief.  The seminar included the following topics: (I) the Science of the Universe, Cosmology and Life's Origins, (ii) biblical faith and Christianity, (iii) possible models of interactions between natural sciences and religious faith, (iv) the limits of our scientific and religious knowledge, (v) what would both, natural sciences and religious faith, gain from a dialogue?</Abstract>

They also presented the results of the course, which included the evaluations of the course by both participating students and professors.  In particular, the workshop explored key motivating exercises conducted in the class, such as: What are the theories of the beginning of the Universe both from the scientific and belief points of view;  How could the interdisciplinary inquiry ranging from philosophy to evolution to physics explain the origins of the universe; and what does belief affect our understandings of our beginnings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores the struggles American Catholic women faced when they tried to create national organizations for Catholic women.  During the suffrage era, a time when women's organizations were gaining unprecedented political and social influence, American Catholic laywomen wanted their voices recognized in the national debates of the day.  They faced, however, both structural and cultural barriers in their attempts to do this.  I will focus on three interconnected problems the women who worked on the Community House project had to confront.  First, and most significantly, these laywomen had to battle both passive and active resistance of the patriarchal hierarchy who undermined the women's control over Community Houses.  Second, they had to negotiate complex parish and diocesan politics as well as deal with priests and bishops who resisted any attempts of outsiders to have influence over the Catholics in their jurisdictions.  Finally, they had to fight for respect from other women activists who viewed Catholics as backward, anti-feminist and possibly un-American.  Ultimately, these problems stymied the ability of Catholic laywomen to achieve their potential on the national stage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will examine the racial dynamics in the religious work of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) and the women of the National Catholic War Council (NCWC).  During World War I, the YWCA established an immigrant aid station to do outreach work among Mexican Americans in San Antonio, Texas.  Fearing that the evangelical Protestant group would try to proselytize Hispanic Catholics, the Women's Committee of the NCWC established a National Catholic Community House in San Antonio soon after.  Both organizations sent native-born, Euro-American women to run their programs, but these workers expressed strikingly different attitudes towards the Mexican Americans among whom they were working.  The YWCA women framed their work as one of breaking down racial barriers.  As one YWCA field worker said, "there is no more important work that can be done in the South and Southwest than the obliteration of racial prejudice which now exists between American and the Mexican immigrant."  The women who ran the National Catholic Community House, on the other hand, established policies that maintained racial hierarchies.  When one NCWC worker was seen in public with a young Mexican-American man, her superior said, "This is a great mistake in this community as the Mexicans are not accepted as equals, and anyone seen in public with them handicaps herself and brings criticism on the work."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines how laywomen of the NCCW engaged in immigration work.  I begin with an analysis of the local work NCCW women did with Italian and Polish immigrants in the post World War I period and then turn to the ways NCCW women participated in national immigration debates in the 1920s.  As Weadick's quote reveals, the women of the NCCW were motivated by desire to protect immigrants from non-Catholic influences.  But the speeches, reports, and private correspondence of the NCCW members reveal other motives as well.  They sought to be as respected as other native-born American reformers when it came to debates about Americanization, restriction and quotas while proving to the all-male hierarchy that Catholic women needed a national presence in order to defend Church interests.  Overall, by competing for the souls of Catholic immigrants, the women of the NCCW were also making a case for their right to speak as both American citizens and as essential members of the American Catholic Church.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The relationship between our technologies and our work has always been an intimate one, whether the wooden plow to the ancient farmer or the MRI machine to the neurologist.  Yet we now live in an age in which our technologies are advancing so rapidly that their effects on our future working lives are increasingly difficult to predict. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; While some thinkers argue that we are nearing a future in which automated labor will lead to wide-scale unemployment, others argue that the past trend of technology creating more jobs than it destroys will continue.  Either way, in light of the advent of self-driving cars and software that can write news stories, it is prudent for us to consider what technological automation might be able to do for us, what it can never do for us, and how its future developments might impact our daily working lives. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This conference will address these themes through the lenses of philosophy, economics, sociology, business, and computer science.  The conference will conclude with the three speakers and an additional participant putting their respective disciplinary insights into dialogue, to collectively tackle the question of automation and the future of work.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; STOKES HALL, S195 (Auditorium) — Campus Map&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Monday, February 27th&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 3:15-4:00pm – Dr. Robert Margo (Economics)&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 4:00-4:45pm – Dr. Juliet Schor (Sociology)&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 15 minute Break&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 5:00-5:45pm – Dr. Juliet Floyd (Philosophy)&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 5:45pm-6:30pm – Panel Discussion: the above speakers along with Dr. William Griffith</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Join historians and archivists for a conversation on using documents and other materials to discover personal histories, especially for those families fragmented by slavery. Maria Hammack will explore some of the historical resources available at the University of Texas. Her research shines light on Texas as a market for slavery and as a gateway for enslaved men and women who escaped to freedom in Mexico. Ashley Stevens will share resources from the Texas Library and Archives Commission, strategies for individuals attempting to trace their family histories today, and the complications involved in tracking down African-American relatives in the historic record.This program will be held in conjunction with the exhibition, Purchased Lives: The American Slave Trade from 1808 to 1865 which examines the domestic slave trade – a racialized system of bondage under which millions of men, women, and children lived and labored.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Firearms and the Common Law Tradition" was a by-invitation symposium hosted by The Aspen Institute in Washington, DC on Thursday, September 15, 2016, on the history of firearms in society, law and culture. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D;  The event was hosted by the Institute's Health, Medicine and Society Program and supported by funds from Stanford University and Wesleyan University. It was convened by Jennifer Tucker (Associate Professor of History and Science in Society at Wesleyan University) and Barton C. Hacker and Margaret Vining (Curators of Armed Forces History at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History), and brought together not only a select and bipartisan group of historians, but also museum curators, legal scholars, and other experts in the field to explore this important and timely topic.   &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In this symposium, papers explored the history of guns and gun regulation in the common law tradition, with a focus on U.S. history but also with an interdisciplinary and comparative lens. The symposium also addressed topics such as the current state of historical scholarship on firearms history, resources and collaborative research opportunities, and promising areas for future research.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The event also included a conversation moderated by Nina Totenberg (NPR) with two eminent legal scholars, Darrell Miller (Professor of Law, Duke University School of Law) and Eugene Volokh (Gary T. Schwartz, Professor of Law, University of California, Los Angeles School of Law), who addressed how and why historical arguments have become important for the judicial debate about guns in America.  On the afternoon before the symposium, September 14th, there was a guided tour of the National Firearms Collection at the Smithsonian Museum of American History.&amp;#x0D; The conference resulted in a manuscript proposal and a round-table discussion with museum curators from six firearms collections  that will be published in Technology and Culture journal (2017).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The AIDS Memorial Quilt was created 25 years ago as a work of community activism to protest the appalling lack of attention by the US health agencies to what was then, in 1987, an increase in improbable fatalities among previously healthy gay men in the United States.  Its first inception unfolded in October 1987 on the National Mall in Washington DC as part of the March for Gay Rights; it included 1,920 Quilt panels.  Now 25 years later, the Quilt encompasses more than 48,000 panels, representing 60 countries and commemorating more than 93,000 names.   It is the largest living memorial of its kind in the world. This presentation discusses the creation of an interactive memorial that was designed to augment viewing of the textile Quilt. Balsamo will demonstrate three interactive experiences that are part of the AIDS Quilt Touch project.  This talk is framed by a discussion of the role of the digital humanities in the creation of technological innovation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation discusses the creation of an interactive memorial that was designed to augment the viewing of the textile Quilt. I will demonstrate three digital experiences: 1) an open-source mobile web application called AIDS QUILT TOUCH; 2) a tangible tabletop interactive that enables viewers to SEARCH the database of Quilt images to find a specific image and to BROWSE the archive of Quilt panel images; and 3) a community sourcing application that engages people in analyzing and archiving information about the Quilt.  This effort is framed by my recent transmedia book project called Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination At Work. In creating the Quilt Digital Experiences I was interested in exploring the cultural work of public interactives, to examine how they are implicated in practices of cultural reproduction—remembering, witnessing, archiving, and educating.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Epidemics, like wars, mark a generation for life." The AIDS Memorial Quilt was created 27 years ago as a work of community activism to protest the appalling lack of attention by the US health agencies to an increase in improbable fatalities among gay men in the United States.  Its first inception unfolded in October 1987 on the National Mall in Washington DC as part of the March for Gay Rights; it included 1,920 Quilt panels.  In 2014, the Quilt now encompasses more than 48,000 panels, representing 60 countries and commemorating more than 93,000 names. It is the largest living memorial of its kind in the world. The Quilt is also an "activist archive" of the late 20th century. The activities that gave rise to the Quilt in 1987 are part of the history of the campaign for gay and lesbian rights in the US. The Quilt literally stitches together a million memories, a million stories, a million lessons about the relationship between individual lives, public culture, and political activism.  In its textile form, it is an unwieldy archive.  If laid out in its entirety the Quilt would cover more than 1.3 million square feet. It weighs more than 34 tons.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With support from the NEH, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) convened a group of regional Native American knowledge keepers, humanities scholars, and digitization and intellectual property experts for project and planning activities associated with the online portal, Writing of Indigenous New England, currently in beta phase. Complementing some of the high-profile digitization efforts now under way in places like the American Philosophical Society and Yale University, our project aims to stimulate grassroots digitization efforts among small tribal museums and elders' personal collections. Quietly and independently, these collections have preserved an archive of Native American writing almost unknown even to the most knowledgeable scholars. Writing of Indigenous New England thus fills in Native people's regional literary history, while empowering them to make their own choices about which documents to make public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Veni, Vidi, Scripsi: Ancient Graffiti in the Latin Classroom&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This workshop will explore the different strategies in using ancient graffiti to teach&amp;#x0D; grammar, vocabulary, culture, and critical thinking. Participants will discuss the Ancient Graffiti&amp;#x0D; Project and its new website as a companion in the Latin classroom. There will also be an open&amp;#x0D; discussion for teachers to share their own strategies, experiences, and ideas about teaching&amp;#x0D; ancient graffiti.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; As Latin teachers, we are constantly asked questions regarding the relevance of the&amp;#x0D; subject we teach. The usual stock answers revolve around the SAT, the possibility of going to&amp;#x0D; medical or law school, or how it allows one to learn other languages more easily. This, however,&amp;#x0D; isn't enough to keep students engaged anymore. It is cultural relevance that appears to be the&amp;#x0D; answer. Students are more willing to engage when they can relate to the concept being taught.&amp;#x0D; But how can students connect their lives to Roman lives? The answer: ancient graffiti.&amp;#x0D; The Ancient Graffiti Project collects graffiti from Herculaneum and Pompeii and displays&amp;#x0D; its findings online, making the collection accessible to the public. The project provides an opportunity for students to view the Romans not taught in textbooks or seen in works by Caesar,&amp;#x0D; Cicero, or Virgil. Graffiti encourages a glimpse into the common man's life that helps students&amp;#x0D; better understand the Romans. Students who use ancient graffiti begin to realize that the Romans are not so different from themselves. It is here that the learning really begins.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In our experience, scholars who might like to perform computational analysis in their areas of expertise and/or wish to teach their students how to do so become discouraged too early in the game. This workshop will provide hands-on exposure to and practice with the free, open-source, web-based tool Lexos, including course materials that we have used in our interdisciplinary courses; our software is available at our GitHub repo. The workshop goal is to lower the barriers required for computer-assisted text analysis over a broad range of texts, including pre-modern and non-Western languages. Lexos requires no prerequisities to use, in fact a take away from the workshop is to stimulate your ideas for the many different ways to introduce students to computational analyses of texts. Participants are encouraged to arrive with a folder of text files of interest (raw text files, .txt, HTML, or XML required; .pdf and .docx formats are not handled).&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Our work on Lexos as an entry-level tool for scholars of digitized texts is presently funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Wheaton College (Norton, MA) and the Center for the Digital Humanities at California State University, Northridge reflects six years of development and testing, including use in our undergraduate classrooms. More information on our successful use in the classroom and in our own research (presently in Beowulf, classical Chinese, Tolkien, Poe, etc.) is available at our website.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This session will be taught by Wheaton College's Michael D.C. Drout, Professor of English, Director of the Center for the Study of the Medieval; Mark D. LeBlanc, Prof. of Computer Science; and Kate Boylan, Digital Initiatives Librarian.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken around the world today, more than half are likely to no longer be spoken actively by the turn of the next century. In almost every case, these languages are spoken by groups of people, often indigenous, who are minorities in the larger societies in which they live. There are, however, a small group of minority languages that are not endangered and which in fact are enjoying robust vitality. In North America there are four such languages, which are spoken in conservative Christian and Jewish religious communities: Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish and Old Order Mennonites); Mennonite Low German (Old Colony Mennonites); Hutterite German (Hutterites); and Yiddish (Haredi Jews). The growth of these groups is exponential due to the twin factors of high birth rates and low attrition, thereby ensuring the sociolinguistic health of the languages they speak.  This symposium will bring together an international group of researchers specializing in these languages with Amish, Mennonite, Hutterite, and Haredi community members to explore sociolinguistic aspects of the social-spiritual identities of these faith groups.      On Thursday evening, March 30, the symposium will open with a panel discussion of community members moderated by MKI Director Mark Louden, followed by a reception. (University Club)     Friday morning and afternoon and Saturday morning will feature 45-minute presentations by the invited speakers. (Pyle Center)     On Friday evening, we will have a reading of literary works in the four languages that evoke the themes of the symposium. English translations will be projected onto a screen for the benefit of the attendees. (Pyle Center)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The concepts of "Contact" and "Cultural Exchange" have been complicated by an increased interest in polyfocal geographical and cultural imaginaries:  what comes into contact in the Age of Encounters are not identities or cultures with objective existences but, on every side, conceptions of the world and ways of being in it and the cultural techniques that organized such ideas and activities—ideas and activities that were themselves undergoing intensive and continual redefinition under the impact of the encounters.  We invite papers that address the encounters of the Early Modern period as meetings of symbolic economies and modalities of representation. We invite specialists from multiple fields to lead us inside particular geographical and cultural imaginaries. Those who study European explorations might contend with open questions, such as: Were the Yucatan and California islands? How large was the Pacific and was it an ocean? Was Cathay near Ochelaga (Montreal)? Was Ophir located in newly discovered lands, and where? Did the Japanese wear feathers? Should Mixtec masks be classified with Asian artifacts in European collections? Did Native Americans use parasols, did dragonfruit grow in the New World, and were there elephants in Patagonia? And who were "Indians"? Asianists and New World scholars will have a corresponding series of questions posed from the point of view of their protagonists. In what ways were larger geographies and conceptions of other cultures applied and subject to change in this period? How did artists, writers, and cartographers, manage conflicting sources and their own preconceptions of the globe?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk is based on one of the chapters from Professor Valeria Sobol's book in progress, Haunted Empire: The Gothic and the Russian Imperial Uncanny, 1790-1850. The book explores the connection between the Gothic and empire in Russian literature, focusing on the portrayal of Northern and Southern imperial borderlands as uncanny spaces. In this lecture, Professor Sobol will discuss the image of "gloomy" and Gothic Finland constructed in Russian literary and ethnographic publications of the 1840s. While being intimately linked to Russian foundational narratives, such the "invitation of the Varangians" and the construction of St. Petersburg, Finland emerged as an exotic and mysterious land after its incorporation into the Russian empire in the early nineteenth century. Finland's ambivalent status in the Russian cultural imagination, along with the Gothic connotations of its majestic sublime landscape and its reputation as a "land of wizards," made it a particularly apt setting for the Russian imperial uncanny. The lecture will offer a brief analysis of Vladimir Odoevsky's novella "The Salamander" (1844) meant to demonstrate this function of Finland in Russian Gothic literature. While most ethnographic and literary texts depict the Finns as a magic-prone, semi-mythological people destined by both history and geography to be ruled by others and enthusiastically embracing the Russian civilizational mission, Odoevsky offers a far more complex and darker picture, using the narrative of the conquest of Finland to critique both Russia's historical path and Western modernity more generally.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk will introduce my new book project, Haunted Empire: The Russian Literary Gothic and the Imperial Uncanny, 1790-1850, in which I investigate the connection between the Gothic elements found in numerous Russian literary works of the period and their imperial context. I argue that the persistent presence of Gothic tropes in Russian literature is not a just a tribute to a fashionable Western literary trend, as it is often interpreted; rather, I read it as a key literary form that dramatizes deep historical and cultural tensions, unique to the Russian imperial situation. Focusing on two spaces of internal otherness that figure prominently in the Russian Gothic—the Baltic/Scandinavian "North" and the Ukrainian "South,"—I attempt to reconstruct the specifically Russian tradition of the "imperial uncanny," a fictional space into which the Russian empire projected its colonial fantasies and anxieties and where it produced the doubles and monsters that continue to haunt Russia's historical imagination.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation is part of my book project, Haunted Empire: The Russian Literary Gothic and the Imperial Uncanny, 1790-1850. The book argues that in Russian literature the empire's peripheries are consistently depicted as dangerous, ambiguous places that destabilize the characters' imperial identities. They become sites of the imperial uncanny, a fictional space into which the empire projected its colonial fantasies and anxieties and where, through Gothic tropes, it produced the doubles and monsters that continue to haunt Russia's historical imagination.  Haunted Empire focuses on two spaces of internal otherness that figure prominently in the Russian Gothic: the Baltic/Scandinavian "North" and the Ukrainian "South." In this presentation I will discuss the historical novel Mykhailo Charnyshenko, or Little Russia Eighty Years Ago written by prominent Ukrainian writer Panteleimon Kulish in 1843. The novel attempts to conjure the ghost of the Ukrainian "authentic" and heroic past, before the Russian empire fully incorporated this region in the late eighteenth century, and produces a vision of its relative cultural independence and chivalric tradition in Gothic-fantastic imagery. The mixed reception of the novel in the Russian press, ranging from admiration for its heroic and folkloric motifs to denying Ukraine any historical past whatsoever, encapsulates the imperial fantasies and fears provoked by the literature of the imperial uncanny.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Literature has long been closely imbricated with practices of surveillance. Not only does literary production necessarily rely on practices of observation (either at the level of the individual or a broader collectives, as with the close synergy between the rise of the modern novel and Western imperial projects), literature itself has often been the object of close scrutiny by the state and other corporate entities. In this respect, literary representation anticipates—and is symptomatic of—a broader array of technologically-based surveillance practices that have emerged in the modern period. As technological advances continue to enhance the ability of states and corporations to surveil the public, even as the public is also increasingly able to deploy similar technologies to its own ends—including efforts to surveil the operation of the surveillance apparatus itself. This latter practice of counter-surveillance is particularly evident in the ways that citizen videos (and the public circulation of videos originally produced by the state) have helped precipitate a national debate in the US over police brutality, but it also has much broader ramifications.  Our panel will examine some of the implications of these developments as they pertain to the new security state. We are interested not only in how issues of surveillance and counter-surveillance are addressed in literary works, but also how some of the discourses and visual archives generated by these surveillance practices may be approached as virtual literary works in their own right. Potential topics include examinations of state censorship regimes, social media and practices of collective authorship, surveillance video and found footage as a form of textual production, digital archives and shifting loci of identity, practices of exhibitionism and impersonation, selfies and confessional discourses, as well as advances in wearable technologies and cybernetic states.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The image of rising Asia as a new economic power has by now become a global commonplace, and Asian as well as Asian diasporic writers—from Mohsin Hamid to Tash Aw, Kyung-Sook Shin to Yu Hua—have variously depicted Asian modes of capitalism.  Of particular prominence in recent literature is a spotlight on the body in this era of Asian capital.  Narratives of cannibalism, organ harvesting, agribusiness, and epidemics abound.  Indeed, social scientists have for over a decade called attention to the distinctive ways capitalism intersects with biopolitics in Asia, in such areas as biotechnology and genomics, the organ trade and human trafficking, population control and family planning policies, as well as transformations of bodily life more generally in capitalizing countries.  This panel invites papers that explore the theme of "biocapitalism" in contemporary Asian fiction broadly defined, Anglophone or otherwise.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When uncertainty is high, and verifiable facts are inconvenient or few, how do individuals learn what to fear and how to respond to the threats they have identified? Coupling findings from recent breakthroughs in cognitive science and psychology with theoretical insights from political science, this paper presents a theory to explain how invented, embellished or simply unverified sources of security-related information can be strategically deployed to materially inform and influence public opinion as well as foreign and defense policy formulation and implementation. I show how, by exploiting inherent human cognitive, psychological and biological limitations and predispositions, enterprising actors both inside and outside governments—"merchants of menace," if you will—can strategically and successfully employ EFI to transform vague, (often) inchoate, and sometimes remote, objective sources of anxiety into proximate, and even existentially menacing, albeit unverifiable, threats to domestic and/or international security. This transmutation happens through a process I call "threat conflation," which is related to, but distinct from, its heretofore more thoroughly explored cousin "threat inflation." The theory is then tested using the case of the decision-making process in the lead-up to the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq (and against the most plausible alternative explanations for the invasion).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rumors are ubiquitous, and their adoption and diffusion have been linked to episodes of political instability, violence and the eruption of war. But not all rumors survive or proliferate, and only some of those that do are disseminated widely enough to influence patterns of collective violence. A critical type of filtering occurs at the individual level: individuals have to assess whether to accept or dismiss new information, and the plausibility and credibility of a rumor's source are thought to be key factors in this decision-making process. Drawing upon original survey data from civil war affected areas in southern Thailand and the Philippines, this article examines where civilians turn to for information when verifiable facts are in short supply, and explores the impact of information source on the uptake and diffusion of rumors. Existing theories offer competing propositions about the relative importance of elites, the media and social and kinship networks in rumor uptake and diffusion. Our findings suggest that local elites can play a singular role: even though they may rarely be the primary source of unverified information, they are highly influential when they do spread a rumor, particularly one about which they might be expected to have inside knowledge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ecent shifts in the media ecosystem raise new concerns about the vulnerability of democratic societies to fake news and the public's limited ability to contain it. Fake news as a form of misinformation benefits from the fast pace that information travels in today's media ecosystem, in particular across social media platforms. An abundance of information sources online leads individuals to rely heavily on heuristics and social cues in order to determine the credibility of information and to shape their beliefs, which are in turn extremely difficult to correct or change. The relatively small, but constantly changing, number of sources that produce misinformation on social media offers both a challenge for real-time detection algorithms and a promise for more targeted socio-technical interventions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ethnomusicology is often conceived as the study of cultural performances by living musicians and their roles in contemporary society. This implies that the field is lacking interest in historical approach to the formulation of performing arts. I argue that in order to fully understand any forms of contemporary performance genres, it is important to trace their historical formation and transformation. Formation refers to the process of formulating a certain genre in a particular period of history; transformation, the genre continues, change, modify, or disappear in accord with the changes of socio-cultural circumstances. This paper discusses contemporary gamelan and wayang from the above line of thoughts: in what ways and what is the result after the genres have to adjust themselves to certain historical and socio-cultural changes and the changing of artists' perspectives. Two main processes define the change and continuity of these performance genres: (1) the interaction between Java and other islands in Indonesia (intra-cultural interaction), and (2) the interaction between Java and foreign culture (inter-cultural interaction). I will illustrate the former by examining the dynamic historical relationship between Java and Bali, its impact on performing arts in both regions. For the latter, the relation between the West and Indonesia in the twentieth century will be discussed, particularly its impact on the content and context of contemporary wayang and gamelan.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>It has long been received wisdom that the Ottoman institution of the timar (fief / benefice / prebend) - which gave a virtual caste of cavalry or other servants of the state the right to tax peasant agriculture in exchange for military or other service - was a linchpin of that state's organization. Moreover, the timar is widely considered as crucial for the successful workings of the empire during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as, for example, the kapikuli ("slave of the Porte") military-administrative institution. The argument continues that the timar institution essentially became defunct by the seventeenth century, thanks to the adoption of viable gunpowder weaponry, inflationary pressures in Ottoman currency, and corruption. This seminar will offer a fresh look at these commonplaces in light of the problem of the survival of mountains of documents and defters—today mostly unseen or ignored—that suggest an institution that did not lose its vigour in the post-classical age and will consider the question, "Who are the ‘zombies,‘ Ottoman timariots or Ottomanist historians?"</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Though the origins of scientific psychology in the U.S. are usually traced to the Harvard psychological laboratory established by William James in 1875, experimentation with mental phenomena had a long history as a public practice, a citizen science that pursued what James called "wild facts" embedded in everyday experience. This science, termed "psychical research", encompassed studies of telepathy, clairvoyance, mediumship, and the emerging notion of a "subliminal" or unconscious self. The Astonishment of Experience shows how field sciences like meteorology and astronomy became models for psychical research, which in turn shaped the professional formation of psychology and its maligned double, parapsychology, in the early twentieth century. Spanning laboratories and asylums, cushioned parlors and remote weather stations, this project presents an expansive vision of how the mind sciences became a site of curiosity, hope, and danger for turn-of-the-century Americans living through unprecedented transformations of subjectivity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The creation, management, sharing, and preservation of digital data and media have gained great prominence in archaeological research, grant making, policy making, and software and systems development. Digital data has much promise. It can help us engage with wider communities, explore new research questions, and create and preserve a vastly enriched body of archaeological documentation. Digital data also has a certain glamor, gained in large part through its associations with the burgeoning tech industry. However, does our celebration of speed, efficiency, precision and innovation sometimes make technology a superficial distraction rather than a substantive means toward learning? How do we encourage more meaningful intellectual engagement with new media as they transform archaeology? This conference represents an opportunity to take stock and more thoughtfully consider how our embracement of digital technologies is transforming archaeological practice. (This was a one-day conference organized by Organized by Rowan Flad, Chair of the Standing Committee on Archaeology, Harvard University &amp;amp; Eric Kansa, Program Director, Open Context.)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Houston is the most diverse city in the country, a diversity that is reflected in the city's food. You can eat Pakistani goat biryani, a Colombian empanada, a Uyghur meat pie, Vietnamese bún bò hu?, Viet-Cajun crawfish, Nigerian egusi soup, a cheese enchilada, Gulf oysters and more all in a five-mile radius.   Over the course of the two-day conference, historians, farmers, food writers, sociologists, activists, and artists will explore the origins of that diversity, how it impacts the way the city eats now, and what it means for the region's future.   The conference opens Friday, February 2nd  with a keynote by Dr. Tyina L. Steptoe, author of Houston Bound: Culture and Color in a Jim Crow City, Texan, and associate professor of History at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The event will culminate on the evening of Saturday, February 3rd with a conversation between the Houston Chronicle's restaurant critic Alison Cook, the winner of three James Beard awards, and two of of Houston's premier restaurateurs, Sylvia Casares, chef and owner of Sylvia's Enchilada Kitchen and author of The Enchilada Queen Cookbook, and Kaiser Lashkari, chef and owner of Himalaya Restaurant.  Between Friday morning and Saturday evening, attendees will also hear from Houston-raised historian of the Vietnamese immigrant experience Roy Vu and Houston Chronicle barbecue columnist J.C. Reid, and Mikaela Selley, Hispanic Collections Archivist at Houston Metropolitan Research Center, will discuss the history of Mexican restaurants and tortilla factories. This is just a sampling of the many interesting topics and presenters at the conference.    The event is free and open to the public. The conference is organized by the Gulf Coast Food Project and Foodways Texas and is generously supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the University of Houston Center for Public History Lecture Series, and the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>*Conference Description* A liberal arts education has always had the ability to transform a student, and thus to transform how they choose to organize their time in adult life: both the time they spend at work and the time they spend at leisure. Yet the factors influencing what sorts of work and what sorts of leisure are available are in a state of increasing flux.  From AI-driven automation, to globalization, to infinite entertainment delivered instantly to the palm of your hand, the general conditions of work and leisure are undergoing a radical transformation.  In this shifting landscape, what role do the liberal arts have to play?  In addition to a liberal education being valuable for its own sake, how can it prepare students for an economy in which whole sectors of work may rapidly shrink or disappear, e.g., through off-shoring or automation?  And how can it help students develop the habit of spending their free time well, in the face of endless possibilities for distraction?  This conference will seek answers to these questions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What did Asia look like to early modern Europeans? Through a closer look at a variety of early modern European sources including printed texts, maps, Mesoamerican codices, and objects held in early modern European cabinets of curiosity, this panel explores some of the surprising and unpredictable ways that Europeans understood Asia in the century following the Columbian voyages. Copious European accounts depicted America as Asia by mapping both onto one "Amerasian" continent, where Mexico was India, North America was an extension of China, and South America was populated by a variety of biblical and Asian sites. "New Worlds" discovered to the East and West of Europe were understood to be convergent; as a result, European collectors sometimes labeled Mexican objects as Chinese, and as late as 1600, European missionaries believed they were baptizing the Indians of Asia. Other sources portrayed China as a superior civilization, but one that Europeans hoped to rival, intellectually and culturally. Far from simply portraying Asia as generically exotic or foreign, these papers explore the myriad and flexible ways that early modern Europeans employed representations of Asia: as a means of grappling with an expanding knowledge of global geography in the sixteenth century, and as a global standard of civilization to which Europeans could compare themselves. In the same period that Europe was coming into cultural self-definition, malleable representations of Asia helped Europeans to define their own global identity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>His current book project analyzes the influence of Reformation and Enlightenment ideas on the Russian Orthodox Church during the era of great reforms of the long eighteenth century (1700-1825). Drawing on previously overlooked sources in Halle, Wolfenbüttel, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rome, and elsewhere, his study will place Russia, its empire, and the Orthodox Church into the wider intellectual continuum of the European Reformations, early modern confessionalization, and the early religious and secular Enlightenments that were so fundamental to the rise of modernity on the European continent and beyond.  Dr. Ivanov has published his research in the Sixteenth Century Journal, Journal of Early Modern History, and Vivliofika, as well as in other publications. He is a recipient of several doctoral and postdoctoral awards, including grants and fellowships from the Institute for Research in the Humanities at UW-Madison, the Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel, the Edward J. Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, the Josephine de Karman Foundation and the Smith Richardson Foundation at Yale, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. He is currently the Vice-President of the Eighteenth-Century Russian Studies Association.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper focuses on the Soyanggang Multi-Purpose Dam project (1967-1973), Asia's largest rock-fill dam and a prominent symbol of President Park Chung-hee's "miracle of the Han" development policies in South Korea. The project, paid for largely by Japanese government grants, loans, and credits from the 1965 Normalization Treaty that settled all claims from the colonial past, was supervised by Japan's leading development consultancy, Nippon Koei, a company that was run by former colonial engineers who had built what was equivalent to Japan's entire domestic power production capacity during the colonial/wartime era in northern Korea. I argue that analyzing the power relations at different scales within transnational flows of ideals, materials, people, and capital around large-scale technical structures such as dams, which emerged out of entangled histories of Japanese colonial rule and the rise of the US Cold War order in East Asia, constitutes a promising direction in Asian environmental humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While the discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1922 is a well-documented story, the conversion of that discovery into a widely used and life-saving pharmaceutical therapy is less well known. This seminar paper, based on a chapter of my book in progress, "Sweet Blood: Diabetes and the Changing Nature of Modern Health," explores how the rise of industrial meat production in North America coincided with the rise of the modern pharmaceutical industry. Using Eli Lilly and Company, the first firm to mass produce insulin, as a case study, this seminar paper explores the environmental history of insulin as a product derived from slaughtered animals to regulate human metabolism in an age of chronic disease.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After the Second World War, diabetes incidence and prevalence, especially its type 2 variant, increased dramatically in North America and across the globe. By the mid-1950s, biomedical and life scientists along with clinicians began advancing alternative etiologies (causes) to explain the rise. One such etiology centered on the modern industrial chemicals in the environment and their effects on animal and human health: endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) that mimicked or blocked normal hormone functioning, including hormones associated with metabolism such as insulin. This discovery prompted debates over the reliability of longstanding toxicological models to explain exposure and health consequences. Scientific uncertainty also yielded further political challenges to identify, classify, and regulate EDCs. Despite controversies over EDCs and their effects, by the 1980s, environmental justice advocates embraced the "environmental endocrine hypothesis" to clarify health disparities among marginalized communities. This tactic produced new political opportunities to address environmental health injustices but has also generated important questions about using contested scientific information to drive public health inequities. This paper is based on a chapter-in-progress from my book manuscript, "Sweet Blood: Diabetes and the Changing Nature of Modern Health."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In August 2018, the National Endowment for the Humanities announced that they awarded $212,247 for Migration, Mobility, and Sustainability: Caribbean Studies and Digital Humanities Advanced Institute. In partnership with the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC), we proposed this collaborative project to host a weeklong, in-person workshop and five additional monthly virtual workshops on collaborative Digital Humanities (DH) and Caribbean Studies. This grant proposal and project developed from our shared feminist technology practices, where we approach and utilize technology to best meet community needs. Feminist technology practices are transdisciplinary, recognize the importance of people in relation to technologies and technical practices, and are socio-technical, encompassing people, policies, communities, and technologies together. As such, this project begins by acknowledging distributed and diverse expertise in our communities, respecting diversity and difference, and affirming the power and value of our communities and networks, including both working collaboratively together as members of the investigator team as well as working in relation to our connected communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper suggests that the history of Iran–Turkey relations is one of secularisation notwithstanding the intense religious wars that consumed them in the early 16th century and their recent antagonistic projects in places like Syria. Shi'a Iran and the Sunni Ottoman Turks signed their first treaty in 1555 and recognised each other despite their sectarian differences. Subsequently, 10 years before the establishment of the Westphalian state system, the two parties signed a treaty that emphasised the principle of non-interference in each other's affairs and respect for territorial sovereignty. Iran-Turkey relations thereafter closely mirrored the development of European ideas about territorial sovereignty and non-sectarianism in international relations. The paper concludes that, given this history of secularisation, Iran and Turkey are likely to manage their interstate contention in the long haul.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper centers on the Palestinian Arab town of Nablus and the controversies over electrification that took place there in the years around the 1948 war. The Zionist-run and operated Palestine Electric Corporation held a monopolistic concession for the electrification of Palestine. As a result, the Palestinian community came to vie electrification as the handmaiden of Zionist conquest. "If Rutenberg electricity lights the city of Nablus and Tulkarm," one Nabulsi writer warned in 1932, referring to the general manager of the PEC, "one can say that Rutenberg and his works have conquered the land." That electricity was only available through a Zionist company presented the Palestinian community with a dilemma. Besides the imperative to reject Zionism and British colonial rule, many Palestinians also aspired to "be modern," which to most included access to electrical power and light. As this paper will show, using previously unused sources from the Israel Electric Corp. Archives and elsewhere, the struggle over electrification in Nablus – within the town and between the town and the PEC – both reflected and remade the political fault lines of the Palestinian community in ways that would bear heavily on the Arab Revolt, the 1948 War, and life under occupation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The purpose of my research is to portrait  the ancient Classical and Hellenistic philosophy on economics. Such a project presupposes, first of all, to examine the prejudice according to which ancient philosophy on economics is either inexistent or embryonic. Many texts, on the contrary, show  the interest of ancient thinkers on economic phenomena. I intend to show that the ancient Greek economic thought does not take the form of the autonomous science of which we are today familiar, but obeys another form of coherence and another rationality, based on philosophy.  The thesis on which this project is based is the following: if the ancient economy is no doubt, according to the term of K. Polanyi, "embedded" in the other institutions of the social life, in particular the moral and political institutions, this integration, far from signifying the dissolution of the economy in other practical spheres, means on the contrary its practical and theoretical centrality for a large number of classical Greek and Hellenistic philosophers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The purpose of my talks is to portrait the ancient classical and hellenistic philosophy of economics. Such a project presupposes, first of all, to distance from the prejudice according to which ancient philosophy does not deal with economics or does it in an insignificant way. My claim is, on the contrary, that ancient thought on economics is based on philosophy rather than on science.  The assumption on which my project is based is the following: if the ancient economy is no doubt, according to the term of K. Polanyi, "integrated" (embedded) in the other institutions of the social life, in particular the moral and political institutions, this integration, far from meaning the dissolution of economy into other practical spheres, rather means instead its practical and theoretical centrality for a large number of Greek philosophers of the classical and hellenistic periods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2019, after sixty-one years of work, the James K. Polk Project will complete the fourteenth and final volume of the "Correspondence of James K. Polk." Transcribed and annotated letters from Polk's entire life and presidency will be accessible to scholars, teachers, students, and all Americans. On April 12–13 we celebrated this accomplishment with "James K. Polk and His Time: A Conference Finale to the Polk Project." The event was hosted by the University of Tennessee History Department and held at the East Tennessee Historical Society, in Knoxville. Over eighty academic scholars, public historians, and community members gathered to take stock of what we now know about Polk and to assess the project's contributions to historical study. Sessions included a keynote address by Amy S. Greenberg, a roundtable on Polk's impact, a screening of Brian Rose's Polk documentary, and presentations about Polk house museums. C-SPAN 3 recorded several sessions for a later national broadcast and archiving online.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This symposium marks the opening of The Story Box, a BGC Focus Exhibition that examines the hidden histories and complex legacies of one of the most influential books in the field of anthropology: Franz Boas's The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians (1897). The collaborative product of Boas's own observations and extensive materials authored by his long-time Indigenous co-worker George Hunt, the text was the first systematic attempt to document all sociocultural, spiritual, and aesthetic aspects of a spectacular Native North American ceremonial structure. A pioneering achievement on many levels—not least in its use of "new" media for ethnographic representation—it was the immediate inspiration for subsequent books, images, and museum displays, and has been the subject of an ever-lengthening list of secondary literature. Yet few readers realize the conditions under which the book was produced, which include the scramble for Northwest Coast collections, the Canadian prohibition of the potlatch, and the participation of Kwakwa ka 'wakw in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. This exhibit and symposium contribute to a collaborative project to reassemble globally distributed collections and fragmented archives, illuminate the book's history, and return long-dormant knowledge to the Indigenous families whose patrimony is represented in it. Speakers include project team members who will discuss the primary media utilized by Boas and Hunt (museum objects, texts, photographs, and wax cylinder recordings), the main sites for their ethnographic recording (fieldwork in British Columbia, the Chicago World's Fair, and museums in North America and Europe), and the legacy of the book in Kwakwa ka 'wakw communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Last year a committee at SIUE was awarded National Endowment for the Humanities funds to plan the Digital Community Engagement Pathway, a program for students who will take a set of core courses emphasizing interdisciplinary research and problem-solving methods. The committee has brought in Professor Liszka to share his work on the similarly designed Common Problem Project.  The Common Problem Project is a consortium of five State University of New York campuses, and is funded by the National Science Foundation, the State University of New York and Teagle Foundation. The purpose of the project is to promote cross-disciplinary teaching and learning, while developing problem-solving skills and civic engagement in students. Faculty from different disciplines are paired and their relevant, existing classes are coordinated to include a joint project, focused on a problem or problems of common interest. The problem can be either local, regional, or wider still. Students work in cross-disciplinary teams to devise solutions to the problem(s). Community partners and instructors serve as expert sources, but emphasis is placed on the self-direction of the learning in student teams.  The talk will give an overview of the pedagogy, practice and logistics of doing common problem projects. Several examples will be used to illustrate the variety of projects and their impact on students and communities, including SUNY Oswego's "Good Neighbor" project, promoting local business, the "Sustainability in the Schools" project at SUNY Oneonta, involving a collaboration of elementary, secondary, and college students. The "Sustainability and Film" project at SUNY Plattsburgh, and the "Stigma in the Opioid Crisis," a collaboration among SUNY Queensbury, SUNY Plattsburgh, and Roosevelt University in Chicago. Several other classroom collaborations will be discussed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Music and sound have been integral parts of the Web's development. Even if computers and network technologies in the early 1990s were limited in their capacities to produce, distribute and present sound, a variety of communities and companies found ways to use the Web towards sonic ends. From early websites where users traded sound-related texts (MIDI files, song lyrics, guitar tablature, etc.) and the noises of new technologies (e.g. the sound of the dial-up modems, bulletin board system welcome tones, etc.) to higher-bandwidth forms of audio (e.g. file sharing, Flash soundtracks, web games, mp3 downloads, streaming music, podcasts, etc.), the Web's sounds have shaped the economic, industrial, legal and cultural logics of the platform. Despite this rich sonic past, histories of the Web generally focus on the visual. We track websites over time, eras of design styles and stages of technical innovation. What if we amplified this knowledge of the Web's visual and technical history by listening to it as well?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This one-day workshop examined the role of mediators in the making and unmaking of power, be it political, economic, or environmental, in various borderlands across InterAsian spaces. Bringing together interdisciplinary perspectives, the conveners consider the role of intermediaries, border-crossers, go-betweens, and middlemen in the frictional zones between polities, where state authority begins to break down. We conceptualize these zones geographically between state territories, topographically between the lowlands of economic elites and the highlands of the political opposition, and epistemologically between knowledge systems. Through ethnographic and historical attention to the instruments of translation and bureaucratic mechanisms of flows, we hope to address the following questions: How do views from the edges of empire reorient our understanding of the center? How are terms between newcomers and natives, imperialists and indigenes navigated, negotiated, and ultimately compromised on the ground? What experimental configurations of power then emerge as a result? The conveners seek to build a comparative framework and common vocabulary in order to analyze how mediators facilitate, obstruct, and reinvent dynamics of connection and disconnection in these spaces. In doing so, they aim to trace some of the patterns in which empires are reconstituted and transformed at their edges.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My paper, "Trans-Pacific Left Feminism: Japanese and American Old Left women, from World War I to the US Occupation of Japan," explores the little-known relationship between Japanese and American Old Left women in the first half of the twentieth century. My archival research of their correspondence has revealed that the so-called "liberation of Japanese women" during the US occupation of Japan (1945–52), rather than being invented on the spot, was instead the result of decades of collaborative labor activism by Japanese and American women. By examining how Japanese and American feminists worked together across national, cultural, and racial boundaries to improve the status of women in Japan, my research highlights a transnational network of feminists centered on the Young Women's Christian Association. The "liberation of Japanese women" in US-occupied Japan was much more of a dynamic site for a trans-Pacific and transwar socialist feminist movement, however limited, than the imperial "middle-class feminist" project of Cold War era, as previous scholarship has suggested.</Abstract>

It will show that the so-called "liberation of Japanese women" during the US occupation of Japan (1945–52), rather than being invented on the spot, was instead the result of decades of collaborative labor activism by Japanese and American women. These women include Professors Fujita Taki and Lulu Holmes, the founders of the Japanese Association of University Women in 1946.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Housing Act of 1949 was arguably the most consequential urban program of the postwar decades. Yet the popular and scholarly understanding of urban renewal does not reflect the breadth of its impact on the American landscape. Despite its broad popularity among communities of all sizes throughout the country, the overwhelming majority of scholarship that historicizes urban renewal is written from the perspective of single projects in large central cities. Building on recent trends in urban renewal scholarship, and on the launch of Renewing Inequality, the urban renewal map prepared by the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond,Reassessing the History of Urban Renewal in the United States:1949-1974 will address this issue by approaching urban renewal from a more appropriately diverse range of geographic and social perspectives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation will allow attendees to consider successful practices to address diverse students' learning needs. Students, particularly if they are underrepresented minorities and/or first-generation, often need faculty and staff to work together to create a holistic approach to diversifying curriculum and pedagogy in an increasingly diverse higher education landscape. Our presentation includes a training exercise to help participants assess their own understanding of diversity as relates to successful learning outcomes. We will then discuss the creation of summer STEM and humanities bridge programs that exemplify faculty and academic support staff working together to create a comprehensive program for academic support and success.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Commercial Pictures and the Arts and Technics of Visual Persuasion" conference will convene an international group of scholars concerned with the power of pictures in the world of commerce. As pictures became a central feature of the advertising message in the second half of the nineteenth century, they migrated from the pages of newspapers and magazines, and the posters on the sides of buildings, to such technologies as electrical spectaculars, film, and later, television. At the heart of this diffusion was an effort to make the pictorial sales message migrate not only across media but also into the minds of consumers. This conference is part of a two-year initiative on commercial pictures and the art of visual persuasion organized by Jennifer Greenhill (Associate Professor of Art History, USC), Vanessa Schwartz (Professor of Art History and History and Director of the Visual Studies Research Institute, USC), and Alex Taylor (Assistant Professor and Academic Curator, University of Pittsburgh). Roger Horowitz, Director of Hagley's Center for the History of Business, Technology, and Society, will join the program committee of this conference.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This three-day workshop (part of an ongoing book history initiative between the University of Chicago and Indian universities) will provide graduate students and early career scholars an opportunity to receive basic training in the paleography and codicology of South Asian material texts, and provide more advanced scholars an opportunity to share approaches, receive feedback on current research, and reflect critically on traditions and trends of textual criticism, scholarly editing, book history, and the digital humanities. Participants will interact and learn from scholars working on different languages, regions, time periods, and traditions, making new comparative work possible and helping to establish a network of scholars working on pre-colonial material texts. At its heart, the workshop will consist of eight presentations by scholars in which they will guide participants through the process of working with manuscripts in a ‘hands on' fashion, introducing them to techniques not only for reading textual artifacts, but also for understanding those artifacts in their historical, social, and material totality using both traditional and emerging methods (e.g. techniques from the digital humanities). This is therefore intended not as a conference for the presentation of finished research, but as a collaborative heuristic exercise in which junior scholars will learn essential research skills and advanced scholars will gain a comparative perspective, thus enabling a deeper discussion of the modes through which textual scholarship illuminates, but also produces, objects of knowledge. The workshop will feature a keynote address by a prominent textual scholar and a final discussion on future initiatives in order to situate the workshop's content in the broader field of South Asian book history and build a community of scholars in this rapidly-expanding field.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper considers the ways in which concerned Americans such as Stephen Duggan, working through universities and organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars, assisted émigrés and reconstituted intellectual communities. The German Max Horkheimer's Institute of Social Research and the Austrian Paul Lazarsfeld's Bureau of Applied Social Research, e.g., were both based at Columbia University, and both received support from American refugee assistance groups and influential faculty members like Robert Lynd. Like Lazarsfeld's Bureau, Horkheimer's Institute served as a refuge for many displaced scholars. But it brought with it a unique style of scholarship, Critical Theory, so peculiar that its American sponsors were not sure how to classify it: its scholars were not quite sociologists, economists, historians, psychologists, philosophers, or political scientists; rather, their method of scholarly inquiry was a hybrid of these disciplines. This unique combination of social research was ideal for the critical analysis of fascism, authoritarianism, and totalitarianism, as represented in comprehensive studies such as Studien über Autorität und Familie. The Institute itself sponsored a methodologically-related study in the American context, The Unemployed Man and His Family, by Lazarsfeld. The Institute's journal, the Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, continued to be published in German, providing a crucial resource for exiled German-speaking scholars not only in the U.S. but around the world. These research institutes were composed of exiled scholars who worked together and exchanged members, but they pursued distinct kinds of research that responded differently to the American context: the Critical Theory of the Horkheimer group attacked capitalist society, while the Lazarsfeld group embraced it. Their relationship with their American sponsors, I suggest, fundamentally affected the nature of their work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, I propose a solution to the v-curry paradox, using Kripke's fixed point construction for truth (1975) and Kripke semantics for modal logic. The basic idea will to be to run Kripke's transfinite construction for a truth predicate over all models of L, and then use those models as worlds in an S5 modal frame, and then define a validity predicate using ?? and the truth predicate. The resulting construction avoids the v-curry paradox without rejecting structural contraction or transitivity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through their art history departments, art and design schools do a good job teaching students the history of the things they will be making.  They learn less about the history of the careers they will be pursuing.  At the Fashion Institute of Technology, an interdisciplinary team of faculty from the fields of fashion design, interior design, photography, fashion business management, communication design, home products development, sociology, history, and art history is creating new lesson plans and curricula.  We hope to better teach students how people have shaped and reshaped the experience of a job or career in art or design, especially over the last two centuries, to show where the levers of power tend to be, and how they, too, might shape capitalism.  We would like to hold a workshop panel at the EBHA to demonstrate and offer training in a couple of techniques.  First Kyunghee Pyun and Daniel Levinson Wilk, who created the project and jointly administer the grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities that funds it, will briefly describe the project's genesis and purpose.  Then they, other members of the panel, and the audience will role-play two class activities from the new curriculum.  Then we will discuss the activities, and help audience members brainstorm other ideas for curriculum about the labor history of artists and designers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this experimental session, historians and art historians present their most effective and least expected tool of addressing issues of business and labor history. This "tool" can be a technological platform or an excerpt from someone's biography. It could be a clip from a movie or a song from the 70s. Or Andy Warhol's works of art can be an illuminating example for queering advertising industry in the 70s.  FIT faculty members were pursuing ways in which to engage fellow artists and designers as well as students aspiring to grab jobs in creative industry. In this experimental session, business and labor historians are invited to expose their toolkits, well known or secretive, to lead a discussion for pedagogical innovations. One could share frustration over inefficacy or redundancy of digital databases while some may exalt the audience with potential impact of AI-assisted visual analysis of old magazine photographs. In a loosely formatted, experimental session, presenters and audiences can dismantle the disciplinary boundaries and pose thought-provoking questions of what to use to better disseminate learnings of business and labor history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 2015 and 2017, 46 small or mid-size galleries, reputable in the field, went out of business in New York while demand for contemporary work has risen five-fold since 2000. Despite growth in the total amount of sales, only 25 artists are responsible for almost half of all postwar and contemporary art auction sales. In 2017, work by this small group of elite artists sold for a combined $1.2 billion—44.6 percent of the $2.7 billion total generated by all contemporary public auction sales worldwide.   People like Robert Cenedella, a professor at the Art Students League of New York, accused major museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art of conspiracy to control art markets, domestic and international, by promoting artists, very few, whose works they own in the collection.  If the artists gain more recognition as pioneer who made an impact on contemporary art as is argued in scholarly essays for a special exhibition, the total value of the institutions' holdings would be increased.   Papers in this session discuss issues such as changing conditions of primary and secondary markets; demise of small or mid-size galleries; rise of public art; growing business expenses; choices made by artists as alternatives to a gallery system; amending a standard gallery contract; transformation of an artist's careers; monopoly of few giant galleries; demographic changes of collectors; and other crucial perspectives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Virtual MLK Workshop Executive Summary  In September of 2019, Dr. Victoria J. Gallagher, along with her colleagues, Dr. Derek Ham and Dr. Keon Pettiway, led a 1.5 day workshop for humanities advisors, library and museum partners, scholars and community partners to assess the vMLK Project, to assist in developing priorities for the next phase of the project, and to consider the project contributions including transferability, access, and the future of intellectual work in relation to digital projects. This workshop was funded and supported through the NEH Foundation's Digital Projects for the Public Production Grant and the NC State Libraries.   Goals The vMLK Workshop at NC State was a key part of the larger NEH funded vMLK production process.  The goals of the workshop included the following:   1.  To review the production of the project components with humanities advisers, museum, library, and community partners and with interested colleagues.   2.  To assess how well the project is meeting production goals and to receive consultation and advice as we prepared for the production of the 60th anniversary of the speech exhibition in February 2020 and planned for the second year of the grant cycle.   3.  To articulate and evaluate the best practices emerging from the vMLK project and to determine how best to make those available and accessible to advisers, partners, and scholars.   Summary of Discussion/Assessment:   The vMLK project offers a model for how to think through large scale digital humanities projects (how to actually do something like this) by: 1) foregrounding theoretical rigor, 2) engaging in iterative processes for developing projects and partnerships, and 3) exploring the potential for accessibility of digital humanities projects on a variety of levels.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After the US Civil War, white southerners claimed federal reimbursements for the value of freed slaves Federal lawmakers rejected these claims in the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet, historians have long concluded that white southerners accepted uncompensated emancipation. Why did Americans forget these claims? This paper argues that white southerners abandoned them in the 1880s-1890s and rewrote history. They insisted that property in humans was "unprofitable," and they did not need compensation after Confederate defeat. This narrative helped them reestablish political power and absolve themselves of four years of bloodshed and generations of enslavement.   The Dina G. Malgeri Modern American Society &amp;amp; Culture Seminar invites you to come join the conversation. Seminars bring together a diverse group of scholars and interested members of the public to workshop a pre-circulated paper.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper reveals that debates over whether the U.S. government secured slaveowners' property rights in slaves continued after the Civil War. White southerners seceded from the U.S. in 1860-1861 to create a national government that protected their rights to own humans. Politicians and lawmakers of the time, as well as today's historians, could not agree whether the U.S. government or slave states' laws secured investments in slaves. As early as 1864, border state politicians who remained in the U.S. and southern politicians who sought re-entry into the Union challenged wartime emancipation and debated: who should pay the price of abolition?   These debates granted a new meaning to emancipation, enabling the federal government to claim control over slavery's legal and economic afterlife. Seeking federal compensation for the value of freed slaves and relief for outstanding debts for the value of slaves, these politicians argued that the U.S. Constitution protected their investments in human property and positioned widows and children as "innocents" who neither participated in the war nor the slave economy. Their strategy failed when the federal government nullified all claims for compensation in the Fourteenth Amendment and the U.S. Supreme Court recognized all outstanding contracts for human property in 1871.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the early twentieth century, African American women librarians in Raleigh, Atlanta, Greensboro, and other southern cities created a remarkable set of small archives that documented Black life. In Roanoke, Virginia, for example, Virginia Lee was a dedicated collector of books, ephemera, and clippings, building a "Negro Collection" inside the segregated Gainsboro Branch Library that today remains the largest accumulation of Africana in southwest Virginia. But like her counterparts elsewhere in the Jim Crow South, Lee operated against forbidding material and political conditions. At times she had to operate secretly, at one point even protecting the collection from a threat of destruction by white city leaders. This talk uncovers the clandestine collecting practices of Virginia Lee to show how branch libraries put record-keeping at the center of Black public life, often under threat of erasure. It argues that any theory of the Black archive must encompass not only the iconic collections in New York, Washington, or New Haven, but also the small collections, like Lee's, that prioritized local access to Black texts. The "lady librarians" at the center of this project were good at keeping secrets, underscoring the risks—and the radicality—of Black archive-building during and after the nadir.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This full day symposium features talks, discussions, and Museum displays exploring women's contributions to history in ancient Mesopotamia  In the patriarchal world of ancient Mesopotamia, women were often represented in their relation to men—as mothers, daughters, or wives—giving the impression that a woman's place was in the home. But, as we explore in this symposium, they were also authors and scholars, astute business-women, sources of expressions of eroticism, priestesses with access to major gods and goddesses, and regents who exercised power on behalf of kingdoms, states, and empires. This full-day symposium features talks, discussions, and museum displays exploring the roles and representations of women in ancient Mesopotamia. Zainab Bahrani (Columbia University), author of the acclaimed book Women of Babylon, will deliver the keynote address. Ticket price includes the newly released book, Women at the Dawn of History, edited by Agnete W. Lassen and Klaus Wagensonner. Tickets also include a light breakfast and lunch, as well as exclusive tours of the exhibits Ancient Mesopotamia Speaks at the Yale Peabody Museum and Women at the Dawn of History at the Yale Sterling Memorial Library.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I presented a paper to the Philosophy Department at the University of Cincinnati that drew on material produced during the grant period.  Here is the abstract of the paper I presented:  The pessimistic meta-induction (PMI) seeks to undercut the realist's alleged connection between success and (approximate) truth by arguing that highly successful, yet wildly false theories are typical of the history of science. Realist responses to the PMI try to rehabilitate this connection by stressing various kinds of continuity between earlier and later theories. I argue that the extant realist responses are inadequate, by showing – through the example of the 19th century miasma theory of disease – that there are cases of genuinely successful, yet false theories that do not exhibit any of the required realist continuities. Moreover, I argue that this case is problematic for realists regardless of whether the miasma theory is approximately true or not.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The medieval Middle East was the most ethnically, religiously, and linguistically diverse literate society in the premodern world, yet it has too often been studied through the lens of a single literary tradition.  This workshop invites early graduate students (considering their options for research topics) to discuss the place of diversity in the region and consider topics which cross the communal and linguistic boundaries imposed on premodern history by most graduate education today.  The goal is to expose graduate students to the region's diversity early in their academic trajectory to allow them to acquire the skills necessary to pursue wide-ranging research.  The workshop will invite graduate students to discuss their potential research projects, while introducing participants to scholarly resources and evidence for exploring diversity in the medieval Middle East.  The workshop will also introduce participants to the Historical Index of the Medieval Middle East (HIMME), an NEH-sponsored digital history project to make the linguistic diversity of medieval Middle Eastern textual sources visible.  HIMME is scheduled for publication in summer 2021, so this workshop provides an exclusive opportunity for graduate students to utilize the collected data for their research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our short film on the Flu caught the attention of the National Humanities Alliance, who called the NN Cannery Project "important, necessary and timely." In April, the organization reached out to Project Director Katie Ringsmuth, and invited the NN Cannery History Project, along with the Celmente Institution, to participate in a briefing with congressional staffers that took place on June 24, at a time when Congress was considering funds for a COVID-19 relief package. As the recipient of a National Endowment for the Humanities grant, Ringsmuth emphasized to staff the crucial and unique roles that humanities organizations—here in Alaska and across the country—serve local communities, and yet, are under immense financial pressures themselves to carry on those services. As NHA put it, "the NN Cannery History Project is emblematic of such efforts."   is a quarterly conference call hosted by NHA that offers our members a brief deep dive into Washington, D.C.-based humanities policy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This research presentation highlights five specific areas of inquiry that I am using to organize my current book project, "The Sword Outside, The Plague Within," which concerns the "Spanish" flu in the European context: (1) The Cultural Geography of Europe During the Pandemic (2) War, Revolution, and the Pandemic (3) Authority and Blame During the Pandemic (4) The Physical and Emotional Toll of the Pandemic (5) The Pandemic on the Eve of Medical Science's "Golden Age." These chapter ideas are guided by a few overarching themes that will show up throughout the entire manuscript. They include: (1) metaphors and narratives that gave the pandemic meaning (2) faith, skepticism, and disenchantment in medical science (3) urbanism and provincialism (4) the 1918 flu as a "forgotten" pandemic. My aim is to get feedback on my project's organizational and thematic ideas at a critical juncture between research and writing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Kerameikos.org is a collaborative project to define the intellectual concepts of ceramics studies according to the principles of Linked Open Data. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the project's scope is to create URIs for concepts within the scope of Archaic and Classical Athenian Greek pottery, including shapes, potters, painters, production places, techniques, styles, etc. Importantly, the project links to URIs defined in other thesauri, such as the Getty vocabularies, Wikidata, and Pleiades, thus forming a bridge between disparate information systems. As a proof of concept, Kerameikos.org intends to aggregate several thousand vases from numerous collections into a digital infrastructure that can facilitate geographic and distribution analyses. This aggregation model is based on the emerging Linked Art (https://linked.art/) JSON-LD profile of CIDOC-CRM, with archaeological extensions derived from specifications developed by ARIADNEplus. In this poster, we will discuss our activities up to this point and where we expect to go in the future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract added March 31, 2021: The focus of the proposed workshop would be on recent work that leverages digital tools in the study of classical antiquity and the itineraries of ancient objects. As participation in the Getty Institutes and other Digital Humanities-oriented working groups has only been available to a small number of digital practitioners, we aim to share a general overview of the work conducted at the meetings of the Digital Institutes, as well as contributions from scholars presenting a relevant short case study of their own work or thinking-in-progress. We are particularly interested in projects which address the ways that digital tools can help scholars better understand the provenance of ancient objects, as well as how this can be visualized and spatially oriented.Informal discussion of works in progress and discussions of problems of methodology are welcome, with the understanding that this is meant to be a constructive Forum for thinking through problems, rather than a formal academic presentation of any complete academic project. In addition to surveying the most recent advances in digital research relating to mapping, modeling, and analysis of ancient objects and spaces,  we hope to discuss  questions such as "what should happen when a digital project is complete?" and "how can we plan for the future stewardship of digital projects - especially those with multiple authors?" Although we might look towards examples of text-based projects as examples for best (and less-than-stellar) practice, the scope of the panel would be limited to tools developed to solve the particular problems posed by material culture of classical antiquity and charting its' past and future itineraries.The ultimate goal of the workshop is to open the work of small groups of DH practitioners to the larger archaeological community in order prevent research replication, as well as facilitate possible collaborations and a larger conversation about key issues in Digital Humani</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This workshop seeks to demonstrate how advances in figure-decorated pottery studies can be applied pedagogically in ways that move beyond simple illustration. Participants, who come from a range of educational and instructional backgrounds, will briefly introduce each section using specific illustrated examples culled from their own teaching. These examples illustrate how figured pottery worksas a tangible and material bearer of meaning and how this can be utilized in the variety of learning situations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The second year of this session focuses on the challenges and approaches to integrating specialist data with excavation data. As specialist analysis often takes place at a different time and location than the excavation project, the data they produce can easily become "siloed". Speakers will include both specialists (zooarchaeology, plants, ceramics) and excavation directors in order to gain perspectives from excavation and post-excavation settings on the pitfalls of data silos and ways to avoid creating them.  (1) How do excavation directors incorporate specialist data into their project databases?  (2) What kinds of negotiations occur between directors and specialists to ensure that data are analyzed in a timely manner?  (3) What key information do specialists need from excavations in order to create meaningful data?  This session is in the format of a workshop in order to promote discussion among panelists and the audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Young Appalachian Storytelling Summit is a youth-led event that focuses on a critical issue: how youth can use storytelling as a leadership tool to create Appalachia's future. Summit participants have the opportunity to hear from young, diverse voices within Appalachia; to understand how the arts of storytelling can help them take action in their own communities; and to join a network of like-minded young Appalachians to collaborate with beyond the event. The Summit focuses on the issues in Appalachia that attendees are passionate about and participants have the opportunity to customize one-of-a-kind agendas based on their own interests and experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Santa Fe College, in collaboration with other two-year institutions across the country who participate in Ethics Bowl, developed a unique model for the 2020 and Two-Year College Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl that successfully met the challenges of hosting a virtual competition.  SF's model incorporated both asynchronous and synchronous competition components that were designed to put competitors at ease in the virtual world and promote those aspects of Ethics Bowl that distinguish it from the traditional Speech and Debate model, namely, collegial and civil discourse.  It allowed teams to spend more time crafting their presentations through a critical, self-evaluative process that promoted deeper understanding of not only the cases, but also of team dynamics.  Although it was recognized that the asynchronous aspects of the proposed model took away some of the spontaneity inherent in the traditional face-to-face Ethics Bowl competition, participants agreed that the hybrid model for a virtual Ethics Bowl had pedagogical and technical advantages.  Going forward, it is a model worth considering, even in a post-Covid world, as it promotes outcomes difficult to achieve in a face-to-face environment, namely, greater participation (due to decreased cost) on the part of two-year colleges, as well as a heightened sense of community among two-year colleges across the country.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Water: a reflection, a surface, a substance, and a movement. A boundary that eludes, precludes and shapes form and life itself.  A vessel that shapes its surroundings and where vessels float, feed, and folly. This live panel shares multimedia poetic experiments in conducting an ethnography with a river, specifically with the Silver River in North Central Florida where Asian monkeys, mastodons, Black Seminoles, self-identified rednecks in motorboats, Northern conservationists in kayaks, tourists in glass bottom boats, Tarzan movies, fungi, Paradise Park (the Blacks only beach during segregation), manatees and alligators (from prehistoric times), migratory birds, algae,  and conceptions of humaNature relationships collide as fragmented facets of the Silver River's identity.  Meryl Shriver-Rice's masters of Environment, Culture and Media program's course called Nature, the Anthropocene and Visual Anthropology (University of Miami) is the milieu for this artistic-scholastic engagement with representations of lifeworlds, culturally specific experiences, and the policies that shape and are shaped by these meshworks. Students are guided by Amanda Concha-Holmes' pioneering work with Evocative Ethnography to integrate videos, texts, soundscapes, images, graphics, sensorial experiences, and poetry to interpret some of the layers of cultural and ecological history through a decolonial, feminist theoretical and  methodological lens that examines the Silver River's entangled prehistorical, historical, and contemporary entanglements of environmental concepts, conservation policies, diverse peoples, animals and plants, climate changes, multispecies perspectives, and the meaning for being, belonging and becoming in Florida, and the world.   This 90-minute panel will feature multimedia presentations accompanied by the artivists who made them for a discussion on decolonization, embodied transformation, healing, and learning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The confluence of two racialized pandemics—COVID-19 and anti-Black police violence—has shaken the mainstream in the Americas from a post-racial slumber. This interview discussion positions a feminist ethnographic lens on the frontlines of these epidemics to explore how Black communities in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and the U.S. South are mobilizing against historically rooted racialized and gendered injustices and receiving unprecedented public attention. The interlocutors we work with and we ourselves are renegade women in anthropology: women who conduct research on the frontlines to support Black lives, organize communities, and provide healthcare without financial and professional security. Our allyship with Black communities manifests in diverse ways. In Brazil, we fund and assemble packages with essential supplies for Black women-headed households who are battling COVID-19 while protecting their children from anti-Black police violence. In Peru, we support Black women who are faced with the choice of exposing themselves to the virus or going without food, income, or protection against violence in the home. We are deeply intertwined with Black communities in Argentina who are being denied access to the legal system. From the heart of the U.S. South, we are uncovering historical legacies of injustices and social movements while using art and technology to design a future otherwise. We are immersed in an anthropology that merges the professional with the personal; together we contribute to a conversation of what renegade women in anthropology means in times of global crisis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this webinar, Dr. Buikstra will first define bioarchaeology, the archaeological science approach taken to investigate the lives of those buried in the Phaleron cemetery. Excavated between 2012–2015 by the Ephorate of Piraeus and Islands under the direction of Dr. Stella Chryssoulaki, the Phaleron cemetery brought to light thousands of burials during the construction of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center. Dr. Buikstra will consider the Phaleron historical and archaeological contexts as well as up-to-date results of the Phaleron Bioarchaeological Project, a collaborative undertaking between the Malcolm H. Wiener Laboratory for Archaeological Sciences of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Arizona State University, and the Ephorate of Piraeus and Islands. To close, Dr. Buikstra will introduce viewers to a few of the people who had been interred in the Phaleron cemetery, providing insight into the past lives of Greece.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Language of Flowers genre is at the intersection of botany, horticulture, natural history, art, poetry, and women's studies. This 19th-century popular literary trend presented the world of botany through dictionaries of flowers and associated meanings, and floral poetry and prose, offering a sentimental view of natural history. A properly arranged bouquet was said to convey a "secret message" for the recipient. The "social media" of its day, this Victorian literary fad, led to many editions of works being published, with multiple titles by successful authors.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This symposium presents the results of the NEH-sponsored collaborative research project centered on the region in the ancient Greek Sanctuary of the Great Gods that coalesces around the famous Winged Victory (Nike) of Samothrace. While the statue in the Louvre has long captured the imagination of the world, it becomes all the more powerful when reunited with its ancient environment. From the Nike's vantage over the performative heart of the Sanctuary—Theater, Stoa, and Altar Court—we reframe the archaeological investigation of this Hellenistic international religious center by grounding the rich material record in the dynamic environmental factors underlying it, and the human actions through which it was determined and experienced.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This colloquium presents research centered on the region in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods at Samothrace that coalesces around the famous Nike of Samothrace, which has long captured the imagination of the world. From the Nike's vantage over the performative heart of the Sanctuary—the theater, stoa, and Altar Court—we reframe the archaeological investigation of this Hellenistic international religious center by grounding the rich material record in the dynamic environmental factors underlying it, and the human actions through which it was determined and experienced. The colloquium presents a cross-section of dynamic new research stemming from archaeological investigation, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and meticulous examination of previously excavated but heretofore unexamined small finds. Collectively, the papers demonstrate the significance of Samothrace as a locus where local and international ambition and patronage met with innovative results, and where landscape and human interaction are integrally interwoven.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This panel will explore practical and philosophical issues related to the cataloguing, care, and interpretation of objects with animal-sourced components, particularly elephant and marine ivories, tortoise shell, and horn. Historic arts incorporating these materials, as well as contemporary jewelry and craft, pose challenges for museum professionals from basic species identification to interpretive contexts. This session will focus on questions such as: What is involved in being responsible stewards of these materials? What are some risks in accepting gifts of animal organics or actively collecting them (and their modern imitations)? How do animal-sourced materials open opportunities for dialogue with audiences? Our goal is to offer a primer or framework for recognizing the under-appreciated contributions animals have made to art and historical museum collections.  Target audience:  museum curators, collection managers, exhibition planners, emerging professionals  Presenters: Lara Kaplan, Katie Lagarde, and Ann Wagner</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a previous article on theories of the sounding voice in China, I argued that it is only at specific historical moments, in certain kinds of discourse, and for certain kinds of purposes that the human voice is disentangled from a matrix of undifferentiated sound, often by likening the voice to other musical instruments and valorizing it above them.  In this talk, I will discuss how the rise of Kun opera (kunqu) in the sixteenth century is another such moment, when the singing voice is explicitly theorized and championed as part of a new art form emphasizing vocal virtuosity and connoisseurship within the entertainment world. To analyze the aesthetic categories and performative context of this musical discourse, I will concentrate on the writings of two key figures: Precepts of the Aria (Qulü), attributed to Wei Liangfu, the shadowy "forefather" of the Kun operatic style, and the personal essays of Pan Zhiheng (1556-1622), who earned the moniker "Venerable Chronicler of Courtesans." Pan is the most outspoken late Ming proponent for the preeminence of the human voice, for exalting an ideal of the voice (both in the most abstract and concrete ways), as something exceeding the words, something even exceeding the music, something even beyond the fusion of text and music. In the final part I will consider the larger implications of conceptualizing the voice as "flesh," both in terms of late Ming claims for the power of qing (love, desire) and anthropologist Tim Ingold's suggestion that we think of "the body ensounded" rather than "sound as embodied."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While some scholars still argue for a stark decline in the appearance and quality of urban life in late antiquity and the early middle ages, others have opted for a softer model of "transition". With this paper, through a contextualized approach, I hope to demonstrate the value of moving beyond these paradigms. Since 2014, I have excavated the coastal town site of Salapia in Apulia. The complexity of its archaeological deposits and the continued persistence of activity across different phases, has made me ever more intrigued by not just how these changes were brought about from the mid-4th to late 7th c. CE, but their impact on the community living there. As a site where we have yet to reveal any monuments, the "unremarkable" and "everyday" spaces encourage and require reconstructing patterns of daily activities to access urban experience. Even a diocese with named bishops and continued connection to the Mediterranean trading network in late antiquity did not halt the slow degradation of the urban fabric at Salapia; nor did the degradation chase away all inhabitants in a single moment. By engaging with theories of industrial ruination (Mah 2012), the material world –the slow undoing of the urban fabric itself –is foregrounded a fundamental part of the social conversation that made and remade the community at Salapia over time.     Every town is the sum of its material signature and the humans that engage and interact in and with its fabric. Nonetheless, comparing the spatial and artifactual remains from Salapia to those of other urban centers in southern Italy (Herdonia and Egnathia) better contextualizes the material choices the inhabitants made in negotiating changes that were local in character, as well as their responses to broader shifts in the Adriatic and Mediterranean ambits. Detailing this progressive decline matters because it is the making of Salapia's local history. So, too, the changes to the community there would have affected the region as a whole.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This panel features new work by historians engaging with the history of New York City's famed Garment District from a range of different perspectives.  Kyunghee Pyun and Daniel Levinson Wilk will describe the new curriculum they have developed to bring this industry's labor and business history to students with prospective careers in New York's fashion industry.  Andy Battle describes the efforts of New York City's International Ladies Garment Workers Union to counter the threat of deindustrialization and links the outcome of that struggle to larger social, economic and political forces at work in the post-World War II era.  Catherine Rios focuses on the history of labor racketeering in New York's Garment District and the political cost that resulted as some elements of the labor movement were forced to make accommodations with organized crime.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>There are many works on antifascism for different countries and periods, but they are generally scattered and do not provide an overall and encompassing view of the history of antifascism in Latin America. Besides, the literature on antifascism in Latin America has been frequently affected by a Eurocentric bias that has downplayed the role of local actors while overplaying the role of external factors. Seeking to establish Latin American antifascism as field of study in its own terms, the panel presentations pay attention to how different groups, in different contexts, adopted and adapted antifascism, what this term meant to them, and for what purposes they deployed it. Presentations explore the origins and evolution of antifascism in Latin America, its impact in several societies, and the legacies left by "classic" antifascism during the interwar period and World War II for later mobilization and resistance during the Cold War and beyond. While establishing comparisons across countries and time periods, presenters also highlight the networks in which antifascist groups operated or that they helped to create, looking at linkages and interactions across local, national, and transnational dimensions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This was a three-day colloquium held to discuss Morris's views on and contributions to the US Constitution and constitutional theory in general. Participants, all political scientists or historians, reviewed a compilation of Morris's writings and his contributions to the Constitutional Convention, his observations on the French Revolution and the failure of its constitution, the War of 1812 and the Hartford Convention. It was led by Prof. Dennis Rasmussen of Syracuse University. Insights gained from the publication of Morris's diaries were sought and reviewed during the discussions, and all participants left with a much deeper understanding of Morris's importance in our Founding and appreciation of his extraordinary life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This was a one-day colloquium at Georgetown Law School's Center for the Constitution, held to discuss papers regarding Gouverneur Morris's contributions to the Constitution and his life. The principal paper (and public lecture, given prior to the meeting) was by the Dean of the Lawschool, William Treanor, discussing Morris's actions during the Constitutional Convention and in the final drafting of the document. Other papers addressed Morris's views on slavery, his constitutional nationalism, his general views on human nature and politics and, in the paper by the Diaries project, the importance of documentary editing in making Morris's work accessible to scholars and the public, with examples from the diaries highlighting the significant omissions and errors in the 19th-century editions that have diminished appreciation of his genius and contributions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1867, African American men voted for the first time in Virginia. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment enfranchised African American men across the United States, including in Kentucky. Poll books, which document those who voted in late nineteenth and early twentieth century elections, can be used to address questions ranging from voting methods to the early impacts of the Fifteenth Amendment. Cara Griggs will discuss how she uses these records to teach about resources that are useful for researching African Americans in Virginia in the decades following the Civil War. Don DeBats and Sarah John will show that, when matched with other records, poll books reveal high levels of Black political participation into the 1890s, directly challenging the idea of the Fifteenth Amendment's failure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The online institute provided participants with practical training in the reading and visualization of 16th- to 18th-century manuscripts in Spanish. The objectives were twofold: First, they learned and honed paleography skills for the accurate reading and transcription of these materials through group transcription sessions and homework. Second, they obtained specialized training on several free and open source tools that can be used to facilitate collaborative research and visualize data in colonial texts. The goal was to cultivate a community of practice, support, and exchange for researchers studying the Spanish Empire that continues beyond this institute.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar examined the feuilleton as a critical space for Jewish political debate, social commentary, and literary innovation. A novel form of urban literature and journalism, the feuilleton was popular in the daily press across the globe. Participants explored the feuilleton as the emerging forum for Kulturpolitik, cultural politics, in German, Hebrew, Russian, and Yiddish. Culture and cultural criticism became a dynamic sphere in which individual authors and thinkers could forward their own political and social goals. Feuilletons were a key site for cultural politics and provided ways for Jewish writers to participate in larger Jewish debates and intervene in national debates from which they were otherwise excluded. As politics continue to be played out over new social and cultural media, understanding the origins of cultural politics—and its connection to Jewish authors and thinkers—seems one of the most pressing cultural issues of our age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Slavery, Nation, and Prison Building" is the first chapter of my book manuscript on the construction of the penitentiary in Brazil. Entitled, Routine Imprisonment, Race, and Citizenship in Nineteenth-Century Brazil, 1830-1890, the book investigates the birth of the prison in Brazil with a focus on Rio de Janeiro's Casa de Correção, the city's penitentiary, and the Casa de Detenção, a remand prison, from 1830 to 1890. This era spans the post-independence period, the termination of the slave trade in 1850, and the protracted emancipation process that culminated in the abolition of slavery in 1888.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation discusses my research on the construction of Rio de Janeiro's Casa de Correção at BRASA's conference in July 2018. My paper is based on chapter 2 of my book manuscript in which I analyze the utilization of slaves, free Africans, and prisoners to build Rio de Janeiro's Casa de Correção between 1830 and 1850. The presentation will also include a discussion of the construction of the Casa de Detenção between 1850 and 1862 using primarily free wage workers and free Africans. The research engages with two important themes of the historiography of 19th century Brazil: labor and citizenship. My analysis of the slave and free labor force used to build the penitentiary demonstrates how authorities deployed the need for inexpensive labor to control refractory elements of both enslaved and the free poor.  This was done by utilizing convicts and slave prisoners as well as vagrants summarily taken off the streets to build the Casa de Correção. I examine in particular the utilization of the construction site of the Casa de Correção as the location for keeping free Africans in protective custody between 1834 and 1864. The story of the liberated Africans at the Casa de Correção is significant because they were put to work in the construction of the prison, a measure which showed Brazil's participation in the apprenticeship labor regimes of the Atlantic in the age of abolitionism. While ostensibly discussing the construction of the penitentiary, my paper also addresses the utilization of free and enslaved workers as well as the significance of confinement in the urbanization of Rio de Janeiro in the nineteenth century. I provide a discrete analysis of the social origins of the prison population who were used as convict labor and suggests new pathways for researching the formation of Rio's working-class in the nineteenth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar presents research from my book manuscript entitled Routine Imprisonment: Race and Citizenship in Nineteenth Century Brazil, 1830-1890, which charts the Brazilian government's imposition of the rule of law using incarceration and involuntary labor as a mean of wrestling penal and administrative control over Rio's itinerant populations in the nineteenth-century. Tracing the decision to build the Casa de Correção in the global debates about the disciplinary benefits of confinement and the evolution of free labor ideology, the research demonstrates how Brazil's political elites envisioned adopting the penitentiary to discipline the free working class. While participating in the global debates about the inhumanity of the slave trade, philanthropists and lawmakers of both conservative and liberal strands articulated a nation-building discourse that focused on reforming Brazil's vagrants into workers in anticipation of slavery's eventual demise. In the midst of building the Casa de Correção, authorities wrestled with the tentacles of the illegal slave trade, which delivered thousands of new slaves to Brazil in open violation of the nation's laws and international treaties to curb the traffic. While traffickers traded most of the new slaves into the interior, thousands circulated in Rio and posed a pressing challenge to public order in the slave society. The police considered the presence of illegally enslaved Africans in the urban population dangerous because they were often indistinguishable from runaway slaves and their ubiquitous existence revealed the limit of state authority over the country's borders.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Does Corporate Ownership of Bound Labor Function as a type of Total Institution? Between 1821 and 1864, the Brazilian state distributed thousands of liberated Africans to public institutions to utilize as bound laborers in public works such as railroad constructions, street paving, the repair of water fountains, foundries, prison constructions, navy and military arsenals among others. The term liberated Africans refer to the estimated 11000 slaves who were emancipated from the traffic by the Mixed Commission Court in Rio and Brazilian judicial authorities between 1821 and 1845. This is a small subset of the estimated 700 000 slaves who entered Brazil between 1831 and 1850 when the government began to actively prohibit illegal slave trading along its shores. Still, between 1850 and 1863, there were various contraband landings that resulted in the emancipation of hundreds of enslaved Africans. The consignment of liberated Africans to public institutions – and to private employers – was based on local laws and the bi-lateral treaties with England to curb the traffic between 1818 and 1835. These legal strictures submitted the emancipated to a fourteen year apprenticeship after which they could gain "full freedom" providing that they demonstrated their ability to live as "free men" and women. The document which I present here originates from my research into petitions by liberated Africans for "full freedom" between 1860 and 1864. The record offers a window onto the historical trajectory of corporate bound labor beyond the eighteenth-century to bring it in conversation with abolitionism and the changing labor regimes of the Atlantic, as well as research on gender, sexuality, and discipline in "total institutions."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On March 30, 1860, Irineu Evangelista de Souza, known as Barão de Mauá, petitioned the Brazilian Government for a license to modernize Rio's system of illumination from gas to electricity. At the time, Mauá was the owner of Rio's Gas Illumination Company and Brazil's most important industrialist with investments in the country's railroad system, the Telegraph Company, docks and other infrastructures associated with modernity and incontestably vital to the "public good." Mauá offered to pay for the cost of placing wires around various posts in Rio's streets at his own expense to remove the dangers that resulted from the utilization of gas in public lightning. The Light Company allowed for greater security at night as it illuminated alleys and streets in the Brazilian capital. The railroad system linked Rio's harbor with the coffee producing hinterland in the transport of commodities, and the Telegraph Company eventually stringed together disparate regions while reducing the communication lines between Brazil and the North Atlantic economies.  This presentation probes how the Brazilian government facilitated Mauá's various business endeavors between 1850 and 1870 focusing on the utilization of involuntary workers, primarily liberated Africans, in placing light posts in Rio, filling the city's lamps with gas, placing railroad tracks, and maintaining the telegraph lines around the capital. The objective is to probe how entrepreneurs such as Mauá who are associated with the spirit of capitalism built projects that were premised on the notion of a "public good" while amassing considerable wealth that consolidated their ascent as a modern, industrialists, and political elite distinct from backward planters rooted in plantation slavery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Workshop at the annual Archaeological Institute of America conference "Let's make a data story: How to create a public-facing data-driven archaeology narrative" explored two themes—data-driven digital storytelling and public scholarship—aimed at improving participants' data-driven narrative skills and develop their ability to share academic research with diverse audiences. The workshop also introduced participants to the benefits of sharing and utilizing linked open data (LOD), building on ongoing discussions about ethical best data practices and standards. Workshops of this type are significant to the discipline as they provide participants interested in careers inside and outside of the academy, as well as those interested in teaching current students, an opportunity to cultivate new skills.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Whether we study literature, history, civics, or philosophy, teaching in the humanities involves the engagement of wisdom questions--the questions that guide human conduct and shape the interpretation of human experience.  This seminar explores the disputatio, or the disputed question, as a time-tested pattern for considering such questions across the disciplines.  The idea animating this seminar is that the disputatio is to wisdom questions as the scientific method is to knowledge questions--it is a step-by-step procedure for producing and communicating, not the final word on a given subject, but a stable, well-reasoned answer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Santa Fe College, in collaboration with other two-year institutions across the country who participate in Ethics Bowl, developed a unique model for the 2021 Two-Year College Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl that successfully met the challenges of hosting a virtual competition.  SF's model incorporated both asynchronous and synchronous competition components that were designed to put competitors at ease in the virtual world and promote those aspects of Ethics Bowl that distinguish it from the traditional Speech and Debate model, namely, collegial and civil discourse.  It allowed teams to spend more time crafting their presentations through a critical, self-evaluative process that promoted deeper understanding of not only the cases, but also of team dynamics.  Although it was recognized that the asynchronous aspects of the proposed model took away some of the spontaneity inherent in the traditional face-to-face Ethics Bowl competition, participants agreed that the hybrid model for a virtual Ethics Bowl had pedagogical and technical advantages.  Going forward, it is a model worth considering, even in a post-Covid world, as it promotes outcomes difficult to achieve in a face-to-face environment, namely, greater participation (due to decreased cost) on the part of two-year colleges, as well as a heightened sense of community among two-year colleges across the country.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the problem of generation -how plants, animals, and minerals come into existence- as considered by eminent English Aristocrat, Robert Boyle. Boyle, most noted today for work in pneumatics, addresses the problem in more than twenty treatises spanning roughly forty years. His understanding of the forces of generation, moreover, would remain closely tied to his ideas about God and the biblical account of Creation throughout his life.  I show how Robert Boyle took up the imagery of seminal principles for religious purposes and made them cohere with his larger mechanical and experimental project. I likewise expand upon the influence that Boyle's Theological Voluntarism had upon his epistemology and methodological approach to experiment. In doing so, Boyle would contribute to a larger project of rejecting Aristotelian essentialism in favor of a modern approach to science. Both his approach and ideas about the forces of generation would go on to have tremendous influence in medicine, philosophy, and the birth of science itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project investigates the epistemic and political functions of images in a pivotal early modern scientific institution: the Académie royale des sciences. During the Academy's formative period, from its inauguration in 1666 to the death of King Louis XIV in 1715, the Academy produced a wealth of images in the form of drawings, prints, medallions, and paintings, and was subject to widespread visual representation. Like England's Royal Society, the Academy was pivotal in the development of early modern natural philosophy as one of the first and best-funded scientific institutions in Europe. This project interrogates how various images and objects were created, selected, and deployed in the service of knowledge production and as a means of broadcasting monarchical power. In addition, this project accounts for the graphic and pictorial practices of both the natural philosophers, assembled in Paris by Louis XIV, and the artists with whom they regularly collaborated. Ultimately, it reveals how various types of visual material – from anatomical drawings to allegorical reliefs on coins – were an indispensable part of the Academy's projects, as well as providing tangible evidence of the scientific ambitions of the French state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Partners in practice, nurses (lay and trained), cultural messengers, political activists, financial backers, secretaries—these are only some of the roles frequently played by doctors' wives, comprising what amounts to a shadow labor force within the medical profession. This talk offers a preliminary argument for the need to consider marriage and romantic partners in our histories more closely, as they are essential to understanding the transformations of American medicine. A true integration of this social world in our histories of health care holds the potential to radically alter our understanding of labor dynamics and the transmission of knowledge and prestige about medicine within society and culture.   At the same time, this talk will also reflect on the major methodological difficulties in documenting this domestic realm. While this history is urgent, doctors' wives have evaded the scrutiny of medical historians for a number of reasons. Not only is much of the history of medicine cataloged in the heavily curated professional papers of physicians, but partners of physicians were often heavily invested in upholding a particular image of their husbands for the public and posterity. By expanding our archive and reading older sources creatively, we can begin to appreciate doctors' wives as a missing piece in the puzzle of our health care histories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Herculaneum papyri are of great significance to both scholars and the public alike, but the fragile nature of the collection makes direct access to the materials challenging. Through the application of advanced 2D and 3D imaging techniques and the development of powerful analysis software, it is now possible to digitally explore the Herculaneum collection with unprecedented levels of detail. Join Professor W. Brent Seales and his research team as they discuss their work to construct a digital edition of the opened Herculaneum papyri and to reveal the hidden text from the closed Herculaneum scrolls.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I recently received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), as part of a program called Dialogues on the Experience of War. The program supports the study and discussion of important humanities sources about war, in the belief that these sources can help U.S. military veterans and others think more deeply about the issues raised by war and military service.  My project focuses on the neglected narrative of the African American experience of war. We will focus on the involvements of black combat veterans in three historically distinct conflicts: the American Civil War, Vietnam, and the Global War on Terror (GWOT). Themes for the project include civil rights and patriotism, the role of race in war, homecoming, and the experiences of black women in war. Those topics will be explored through multiple humanities sources including historical documents, literary selections, public history, and film. In Summer 2022, eight discussion leaders will participate in an intensive residential preparatory program that is grounded in the humanities and receive training in discussion facilitation. In Fall 2022 and Spring 2023, a series of focus groups will be conducted with local African American combat veterans at the historic Moton Museum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scrimshaw is broadly understood as the art and craft of decorative and practical objects, created by whalemen and sailors using the material byproducts of the whale hunt, including sperm whale teeth, walrus tusks, skeletal bone, and baleen. This workshop, designed especially for cultural heritage professionals, will also provide a rare, hands-on introduction to the practice and materials of scrimshaw. As part of our NEH grant to catalog "overlooked organics," Dr. Frank will analyze the Winterthur collection of scrimshaw. For our seminar program, he will deliver a lecture about scrimshaw, delving into its history, practice, and materials. Following the lecture, our curatorial and conservation staff will present museum objects alongside materials from the conservation study collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What do we think of when we think of Vietnam? For many, Vietnam was and remains a war that haunts veterans, families, and politicians. But to think only of the "Vietnam War" overlooks a country and its story. In fact, many Vietnamese wonder why Americans are so preoccupied with the "American War"!  This NEH Summer Institute will explore modern Vietnam in order to situate the American War in broader spatial settings and longer historical contexts. Vietnam's landscapes range from forests, over mountains, through fields, and downstream to river deltas. Vietnamese lives move from village to city, meander through cafes and rice paddies, cross oceans and land again. Many people called "Vietnamese" today did not even speak the national language until deep into the twentieth century.  This institute aims to introduce a fascinating place rich in history and to animate a geographic and historical perspective among participants. Based on a course developed by Christian C. Lentz from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with assistance from the Carolina Asia Center, the institute offers teachers a chance to learn from Lentz and other scholar-experts about Vietnam and how to teach its history and geography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Aguirre-Mandujano organized and participated in this discussion of reading practices and contexts in the early Ottoman Empire, with five other scholars. His paper noted one of the most interesting examples about Ottoman reading practices that comes from a small introduction to the transliteration of a selection from Mesihi's epistolary. Mesihi was a poet and bureaucrat at the turn of the sixteenth century who compiled around a hundred letters into one single volume, the Rose of a Hundred Petals. Mesihi's work was among other compilations of Ottoman high prose.  Historian V. L. Menage notes that Mesihi's work is only mentioned in one of the sixteenth century biographical dictionaries of poets, Latifí´s Tezkiretü´l-suara —one of the most important sources for reconstructing the lives and works of early modern Ottoman poets and scholars. Latifi describes Mesihi's work as being similar to another fifteenth century manual for letter writing. The books are not at all similar, thus Menage concludes from this comparison that Latifi clearly had not seen the actual book. This remark by Menage highlights an interesting, if unintended point: how little we know about how Ottoman learned men talked about books, even when they might not have read them. In my work, I argue that knowing and talking about books and literary works did not always required physical reading and study, or even seeing the actual book. In this roundtable, I will focus on biographical dictionaries of poets and discuss what they tell us about practices of reading and not reading. I will raise two points for consideration: First, the access, use, and management of information required for the creation of the biographical dictionaries. Second, what practices of knowing (oral, communal, book reading) can be seen when reading biographical dictionaries, poems, and introductions to literary works that shed light on how Ottomans talked about books.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract  This paper provides a descriptive analysis of bilingual language across online platforms by island youth. We provide findings of 2 social networks (Milroy and Llamas, 2013) of Puerto Ricans and qualitatively detail how different technological platforms provide different ideological spaces for communication and the construction of identities, whereby ideological practices exist each matching expected audiences and ideologies attached to virtual spaces. Individuals, in turn, orient to these platforms and their imagined audiences through a diverse range of semiotic practices. In this sense, we project the image of an island bilingual that is strategic, multimodal and literate in different Englishes, Spanishes and in-between contact styles. Furthermore, we position the Puerto Rican Internet user as stylistically engaging in two competing ideological linguistic markets: that of Global Englishes (encompassing standard and non-standard varieties of English) as well as Global Spanish (encompassing Puerto Rican Spanish, standard Spanish, and features of Internet Spanish).   Data are gathered from popular social media applications (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) as well as text-messaging applications (WhatsApp, iMessage), for a total of 500 screenshots. By incorporating a multimodal perspective (Bezemer and Kress, 2015) to interpreting bilingual speech, the Puerto Rican bilingual is positioned as a translingual communicator, influenced by their everyday investments in society (e.g., social practices), social circumstances (e.g., education, socioeconomic status), as well as the mediatization that has transformed traditional boundaries of the so-called "speech community" (Jacquemet, 2019). Findings from this paper further illuminate the nature of the translanguaging practices in modern day Puerto Rico, particularly among the youth (Morales Lugo, 2019, 20</Abstract>

		<Abstract>FLAME (Framing the Late Antique and Early Medieval Economy) Conference 2022 This conference will bring together an international group of scholars who have worked on Princeton's FLAME project, as well as leading scholars on the late antique and early medieval economy worldwide. Over three days, speakers will present new findings centred on the research priorities of the FLAME project. Participants will share insights on economic, political, and social changes throughout this period, but will also reflect upon the  historiographical and methodological problems posed by the project itself. The papers will involve insights from a significant global region, as FLAME's scope ranges from Gibraltar to southeastern India. An exhibition of coins relating to the conference from the Princeton University Numismatic Collection will accompany the conference and will be on display outside of East Pyne 010 on March 18th and 19th.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Roundtable proposal: Sense-making in the Bilingual Oral History Interview   Czeslaw Milosz once wrote that "language is the only homeland." Milosz' words ring particularly true in contexts of displacement, where language comes to act as a potent symbol of belonging and identity.   This roundtable honors this facet of migrant identity by discussing how "movements" across languages during oral history interviews can be interpreted. Based on three English-Spanish oral history projects, respectively recorded in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Argentina, presenters will discuss how participants' movements from one language to another illuminated an understanding of their migration journeys.   Sarah O'Brien will draw from fifty interviews recorded with third generation Irish descendants in Argentina (2010-2012). Her presentation will problematize the role of language in diasporic contexts by illustrating how racist discourses in nineteenth century Argentina encouraged the English language maintenance amongst successive generations of Irish-Argentine descendants. Alejandra Nuñez will approach this topic from the perspective of Mexican migration. Referencing 23 oral histories recorded with bilingual transnational youths in Mexico, she will illustrate how focusing on language-use as a discussion point during the oral history interview empowered participants to reflect upon their development of a transnational identity [...]  Katherine Morales' presentation addresses the narratives of identity and belonging that emerged through bilingual practices in a series of ethnographic oral history interviews conducted in a public school in Puerto Rico. The English language in this setting is considered a symbol of prestige, unequally distributed among the masses. By adopting a heteroglossic (see Bakhtin)  framework, this presentation highlights how transnational adolescents made sense of their cultural and social realities, by strategically drawing on the linguistic repertoires.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Arabic medical commentators were well-versed in philosophy. Many of them had received philosophical training at the hands of some of the leading philosophers of their time. Moreover, they adopted the very specific method of philosophical investigation, verification (ta?qiq), developed by the philosopher-theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1210) and deployed in his medical commentary. Using examples from the discussion on the definition of medicine, this talk will highlight the philosophical sophistication of the Arabic medical commentaries on the Canon.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A public conference to consider the scholarship of the recent "Sailing to Freedom: Maritime Dimensions of the Underground Railroad" edited volume (UMass Press, 2021). The conference will be held at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts on 23 September 2022. Presented in collaboration with the New Bedford Historical Society, the conference brings together the contributing authors of the "Sailing to Freedom" project in person for the first time and provides an opportunity for other invited scholars to comment on the importance of the book and its ideas/arguments.  The keynote speaker is distinguished Underground Railroad historian Fergus M. Bordewich. Conference panels will examine the historical record and recent research about the maritime Underground Railroad. The assembled scholars, teachers, and public historians will share their diverse views and expertise about the experiences of maritime freedom seekers and those who assisted their escapes. New Bedford, known as "the Fugitive's Gibraltar," was an important terminus of the Underground Railroad, where many escaped slaves settled and worked in whaling and maritime industries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On March 18-20, 2022, nearly two dozen global-critical philosophers of religion will participate in a NEH-supported mini-conference that explores alternative sets of topics, methods, and aims for global-critical philosophy of religion. Presentations will later be developed as essays and collected into a volume to be published with Bloomsbury.  Since at least the European Enlightenment, the core topics of western philosophy of religion have consisted of the nature and existence of God, the problem of evil, and the immortality of the soul. These topics are implicitly taken as natural or rational, even used in some cases as the fundamental categories for global philosophy of religion. Witness, for example, the multi-million-dollar "Global Philosophy of Religion Project" recently funded by the John Templeton Foundation at the University of Birmingham, which deploys the categories of existence and nature of deities, death and immortality, and evil and suffering in the world "to make progress on central issues in the philosophy of religion by incorporating multi-religious perspectives" (https://www.global-philosophy.org/projects). But what if philosophy of religion had begun in some other place or at some other time? Would its core categories of inquiry resemble those of contemporary western philosophy of religion?  This mini-conference and essay collection addresses these questions, exploring what the core topics (as well as the methods and aims) of philosophy of religion might have been (or actually were or are) in socio-historical contexts, religio-philosophical traditions, and methodological-theoretical orientations other than contemporary, western philosophy of religion (especially in its analytic mode). In doing so this volume of essays challenges the implicit claim that the core topics of western philosophy of religion are somehow natural or rational and therefore well-suited for global philosophy of religion. It also  .... (See website for full description.)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This workshop had three primary goals:  Facilitate interdisciplinary communication and connections between roboticists and researchers in different fields on the subject of LAWS, to better understand differing perspectives and opinions as well as opportunities for progress. Advance our understanding of technical and ethical issues related to LAWS, and document these insights as workshop proceedings in a suitable archival venue. Create the foundation for lasting working groups to propose well-articulated positions on the regulation of autonomy in robotic weapons systems, with the long term goal of proposing to the RAS Research and Practice Ethics Committee a path toward what robotics as a discipline can contribute to the governance of AWS.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digging Up Data was first organized as a series of three virtual workshops, collaboratively planned by members of the team at The Alexandria Archive Institute/Open Context (AAI/OC) and the American Society of Overseas Research Early Career Scholars Committee (ASOR ECS). These workshops, hosted live in fall 2021 and now shared on ASORtv, aimed to offer ASOR members an introduction to data literacy. What is data literacy and why is it important for archaeologists to be data literate? How do we begin to find, produce, curate, and analyze data? And how do we compose data-driven narratives of our research for diverse, public audiences?   The overwhelming interest in this initial collaborative program around data literacy encouraged the AAI/OC and ECS to team up again to offer the next installment in the Digging Up Data series: an experimental professional development program entitled Turning an Idea into Digital Scholarship. Under the mentorship of Leigh Anne Lieberman (AAI/OC) and Tiffany Earley-Spadoni (ASOR ECS), participants will work during the upcoming year to develop a public-facing, engaging, data-driven digital project concerning some aspect of their research and present that work at the ASOR conference in Boston (November 2022).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation's goal is to increase understanding of the evolving concept of moral injury and its impact on military Veterans. The design, implementation, and results of a humanities intervention for moral injury in Veterans will be discussed. The presentation will provide a comparative analysis of two NEH-funded projects that used military comics and scene work from Shakespeare's plays as an entry point to explore and come to a deeper understanding of moral injury.  Learning objectives: • Identify and contrast clinical definitions of moral injury and reconstructed definitions from the program participants' point of view • Describe program results and impact on moral injury symptoms • Relate the medical benefits and potential impact of arts &amp;amp; humanities- based programming on clinical conditions</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We will share our method of ritualized communal reading developed for military veterans healing from the moral injuries of war. We acknowledge that moral wounds are in complex relationship with perpetrators, victims and witnesses. Our approach uses humanties texts such as comics, poems and historical plays, as an entry point to discuss the spiritual and ethical dimensions of service and betrayal. With the help of facilitators, participants may choose to "act" a short scene that contains a familiar moral wound. This will be followed by a structured discussion. Reading the stories out loud allows participants to enact emotions through the characters, offering cover from personal exposure. The visceral experience, for both "actor" and audience allows for a greater depth of dialogue around these wounds. In our experience, this creates a strong sense of belonging through collective suffering and opportunities for communal repair. With special techniques that ensure success with the unfamiliar language, participants are guided through the powerful poetry and stories of Shakespeare and the multidimensional graphic storytelling of comics. Following the participatory performance and dialogue demonstration, we will discuss how the method and tools might provide people with opportunities to co-create new language around moral repair. Our intention is to expand this method beyond the veteran community to other groups that have experienced institutional betrayals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Problem: The positionality and multiple identities of female veterans at the intersections of race, ethnicity, and gender impact the experience of moral injury. Exploring and validating these experiences is critical to create a deeper understanding of these wounds. Program: The Warriors Path: War, Moral Injury and Reclaiming the Soul is a National Endowment for the Humanities funded program that used military comics to develop a moral injury lexicon for women Veterans with military sexual trauma. Approach: The discussion group used graphic novels, comics, poetry, prose, and art to facilitate discussions of moral injury (MI) in the context of ageism, disability, ethnicity, gender neutrality, homophobia, marital/relationship status, national origin, racism, religion, sexism, socio-economic class, and many other topics. Results: Several Women Veterans identified institutional betrayal, familial betrayal, military training, lack of post-deployment recuperation period, as their primary MI. All participants agreed liked using humanities-based formats to help them dig deeper and reframe the social injustice they experienced. Notably, participants did not endorse the moral injury definitions of psychiatry or psychology. They did endorse the definitions provided by philosophy and chaplaincy. This presentation will introduce our approach and discuss program impact on social justice-related issues.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeologists routinely create and use data, but they rarely talk about how they work with data. As a profession, we need to be more open and share our experiences and frustrations in working with data.  The ARF field school specifically serves students that need professional experience in archaeology but have financial or other restrictions that would prevent them from traveling to a project outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.  As a guest lecturer for this field school, I explored some of the challenges of working with data. We discussed why archaeologists create structured data (information organized to facilitate quantification and other computer analysis). We raised some of the methodological and ethical challenges involved in making structured data. Last, we looked at how we use both structured and unstructured (narrative) data. In practice, both play a role in shaping our understanding of the archaeological past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Looking Back, Moving Forward, is a 2-day virtual conference critically examining the past, present, and potential future roles of the law and legal strategies to advance environmental justice (EJ) policy and action.  The conference takes as its starting point the 30-year struggle by the renowned EJ group CRCQL (Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living) to shut down the nation's largest waste incinerator in Chester, PA. Drawing on the lessons learned from CRCQL's ongoing organizing against environmental racism, our panelists expanded the conversation to explore new and exciting approaches to EJ law and policy-making being used by grassroots EJ movements more broadly.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation was a first synthesis of archival material collected as a fellow in Spring 2022; I showcased the conceptual framework developed during my fellowship, highlighted key findings from the archives, and refined the structure I will utilize in the book under development.   In the mid-1990s, a crazy-haired teacher named Ms. Frizzle took children on field trips inside the human body and to the outer reaches of space. The Magic School Bus was a centerpiece experiment to reinvigorate American science education that became a global phenomenon. The television series' catchphrase, "Take Chances! Make Mistakes! Get Messy!" suggested new ways of getting children excited about science. In contrast to a white-coated man performing demonstrations, the show used cartoon animation to help viewers experience science in action and to allowed the children to venture into unreachable environments and imagined worlds. Along the way, Ms. Frizzle encouraged kids to take risks, to fail, and to find patterns. Beyond its pedagogical innovations, The Magic School Bus was an experiment in how to pay for the technoscientific future. The show resulted from a public-private "synergy" between government agencies, commercial publishers and broadcasters, high tech companies, and even McDonald's. It combined science education with CD-ROM software, a traveling show, and a clothing line. In this talk, I use The Magic School Bus to analyze "edutainment" and science education reform in the late-20th century. I explore how in content and in form, The Magic School Bus contributed to an emerging model of "STEM" education in a fraught era for science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The intersections of race, ethnicity, and representation have shaped historical and contemporary articulations of Afrolatinidad. The Representations of Afrolatinidad conference aims to engage multiple depictions of Afro-Latin American and Afro-Latinx communities – whether self-fashioned or imposed. The varied portrayals in the past and present reflect the ongoing global realities, struggles, vibrancy, and resiliency of Afro-Latin diasporas throughout the Americas and elsewhere. The symposium featured keynote speakers Dr. Kia Caldwell (Washington University in St. Louis) and Professor Tanya K. Hernández (Fordham University). Their work on issues of race, gender, and health equity in Afro-Latin America and anti-Black bias among US Latinx, respectively, will spark broader exchanges around Afrolatinidad and representation among presenters and attendees.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A revolution has slowly begun in the study of historical documents: Machine Learning tools have been developed to allow for the automatic transcription of documents. Over the last decade, these tools can now help assist in the production of texts from medieval manuscripts at previously unobtainable levels of accuracy. Today, libraries have used these tools to make their collections searchable, while researchers have sped up the process of creating editions of texts and adopted them for the study of medieval documents.  The course will offer an introduction into some of these ongoing projects, but more importantly provide an introduction into the practice of studying medieval documents with Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technologies. The course will have two main parts: 4 online sessions and a three-day in person workshop in Vienna. During the first phase, participants will be introduced to both the theory of handwritten text recognition and its practical application using the Transkribus (transkribus.eu) tool. We will then work in four groups, focusing on four different periods and languages: Carolingian Latin, late medieval Latin, late medieval German, and late medieval Czech. Each group will have its own supervisor and its goal will be to train an HTR model for each type of writing.  During the in-person workshop in Vienna, we will finalize the four projects and publish our results online: both the transcriptions and Handwritten Text Recognition models. Additionally, we will also visit libraries in Vienna to see selected manuscripts in person. Finally, we will test other machine learning tools for their automatic transcription outcomes and use other digital tools. The course will be taught by a team of experts in HTR, medieval manuscript studies and Latin, German and Czech philology. At the end of the course, you will receive a certificate.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abraham Shalom Yahuda (1877-1951) is one of the most enigmatic, influential, and overlooked Jewish intellectuals of the twentieth century. Born into an Iraqi-Jewish and German-Jewish family in Ottoman Jerusalem and educated in Germany, Yahuda was a scholar of Hebrew and Arabic texts and held the first-ever university professorship in Jewish studies, at the University of Madrid. For more than three decades, Yahuda made his living as a manuscript dealer, buying rare Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts and selling them to libraries and collectors in Europe and North America, including the British Museum, the Irish-American collector Cheater Beatty, Princeton University, the University of Heidelberg, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the U.S. Army Medical College (now the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland). At the end of his life, he bequeathed his remaining collection to the National Library of Israel, including the archive of Isaac Newton. Examining all Yahuda's activities from three-hundred-sixty degrees reveals a network of local cosmopolitans and entrepreneurs who capitalized on their knowledge and access to antiquities as the old imperial order crumbled. His correspondence provides essential information on the provenance of Middle Eastern and South Asian manuscripts, information that is otherwise difficult and painstaking to reconstruct.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over Summer 2022, an instructional community of faculty and graduate students assembled to collectively design the five new courses for the Certificate in the Humanities, each tailored to a distinct General Education requirement. These courses draw from and integrate themes that connect directly with the impacts of the biotechnological, computational, and data scientific technologies engineering students study and develop in their careers post-graduation. As an overarching goal, the courses inspire students to cultivate a sense of epistemic humility — to decenter the present moment, problematize conventional narratives, and reckon with the unintended consequences of their field. Each course had a set of course leads (drawn from faculty and graduate students) who worked together to develop a syllabus and assignments and shepherded the course through the course approval process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper begins with a look at the relationship between Gwendolyn Brooks and Richard Wright within the larger context of the Chicago Black Renaissance. Drawing upon new and extensive archival research, the paper maps out what was distinctive about Chicago's literary culture at this time-especially in comparison to Harlem. It tells a story of interracial collaborations supported by the Works Progress Administration, and explores the question of how black writers conceived of an audience for their writing, when they were dependent upon white publishers. Ultimately the paper puts forth two claims: that the art and literature of Bronzeville balanced the aims of social realism with the experimental forms of literary modernism; and that the Chicago Black Renaissance was a movement with its own distinctive energy even as it was informed by a set of aesthetic concerns characteristic to Chicago more broadly.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Writers and artists discussed in the paper include: Nelson Algren, Arna Bontemps, Gwendolyn Brooks, Horace Cayton, Jack Conroy, Eldzier Cortor, Ralph Ellison, Vivian Harsh, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Wayne Miller, Inez Stark, Gertrude Stein, Era Bell Thompson, Margaret Walker, Richard Wright.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rabbinic court records provide rich sources for the study of early modern European Jewish life. The authority to adjudicate civil disputes ranked among the most highly valued of all privileges extended to Jews in the course of their history. This conference explores French and German rabbinic courts of the late 1700s, just before the French Revolution, and challenges our understanding of the beginnings of Jewish modernity.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This program is part of a series of events about the early modern community of Metz, France in honor of the publication of Protocols of Justice: The Pinkas of the Metz Rabbinic Court, 1771-1789, introduction and editing by Jay Berkovitz (Brill Press, 2013). An accompanying exhibition, Circles of Justice, will open in October. The Pinkas (Register) of the Metz Rabbinic Court is a rare and little-known volume from the collections of the YIVO Institute Archives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The purpose of this conference is to bring together scholars who are well situated to think through the practice and direction of transnational urban history and planning at an early point in their development. Drawing upon our own research, we will exchange ideas about methodology and theory; and in light of the way that other fields have been transformed by the transnational turn, we will consider how best to frame our own contributions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>It takes skills to tell a story. What skills it takes depends on the medium we use. Film is the medium of showing. What to show closer? What to show longer? What to show once, and what to show again?  Filmmakers have dealt with these problems since the beginning of cinema. Those who study film history today need to have a clear picture of how and why filmmakers made these decisions throughout time. What were D.W. Griffith's favorite camera set ups in 1914? What year was it that Chaplin learned to cut? Questions like these relate to film editing, and will keep coming up as long as film editing remains art. How many cuts does that seemingly seamless Birdman hide? How did they slice and splice the 12 years of real time in Boyhood?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Cinemetrics is a website that helps to puzzle out such questions. Launched in 2005 as a digital tool designed to assess and compare various ways of editing films, Cinemetrics has grown into a global forum on experimental methods in cinema studies. Hundreds of film students and scholars from different countries, each with their own research agenda, submit shot-length and shot-scale data to the Cinemetrics website. For years, we have been comrades-in-arms in cyberspace. Between 2013-2015, the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society has enabled us to talk to each other face to face about the value of Cinemetrics data. As part of this project, from April 30 to May 3, 2015 the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society and the Film Studies Center will host the International Conference "Cinemetrics Across Borders" at the University of Chicago, which will bring together filmmakers and scholars from around the world. Co-sponsored by the Adelyn Russell Bogert Fund of the Franke Institute for the Humanities and the Chuck Roven Fund for Cinema and Media Studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After meeting at the NEH Institute in San Jose, CA, high school teachers Faisal Mohyuddin, Aaron Becker, and John Ehresman conceived of an exchange of three subjects (English, Spanish, Social Studies), three different schools (Evanston Township H.S., North Lawndale College Prep, Highland Park H.S.), and three different demographics.  The teachers selected one of their classes of students to participate in the exchange.  Each class visited the other schools once, and during that visit, the visiting students were supposed to have created and directed the activities. After the hour's activities, students were assigned a shadow and they attended classes with their partner and lunch as well.  After the final school visit, all three groups united at Northwestern University for a "summit," where Lakin Valdez led a performance-based workshop.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Aristotle says happiness is the highest aim of human life, the only end that is not a means to some other end. Happiness, he argues, is ‘an action of the soul in accordance with virtue.' How can we live a private life that contributes to our happiness? How can we live a public life that contributes to our happiness? This seminar takes a philosophical and sociological approach to these fundamental questions. Readings are drawn from Aristotle, Alexis de Tocqueville, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Jonathan Haidt. Student will engage in practical exercises and propose projects to enhance happiness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In September 2013, Dr. DeRionne Pollard, Montgomery College president; Dr Judy Ackerman, vice president and provost at the Rockville Campus; Dr Rita Kranidis, professor of English and director of the Global Humanities Institute (GHI); and other members of the College attended a meeting that forged a relationship with Xian University in Xian, China, home of the terracotta warriors. The partnership was initiated by Dr. Kranidis in the fulfillment of the institute's grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Montgomery County, which has selected Xian for its Sister Cities program, assisted with this effort in many ways. The Memorandum of Understanding includes provisions for a series of seminars and colloquia between humanities faculty at Xian University and Montgomery College, to be carried out when the GHI will sponsor travel to China for fifteen faculty, staff, and administrators. Topics for these discussions will include the cultural value of the humanities in China and in the United States, views on need for global curricula, and public arts and humanities programs. Additionally, the MOU opens the possibility of future student and faculty exchanges. Xian University has a strong commitment to history, cultural preservation and study, and is thus the ideal partner for the work of the Global Humanities Institute.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Symposium will use both Congressman Stevens and President Buchanan as unique lenses through which to examine nineteenth-century political history with an in-depth look at party formation and re-formation; slavery, race and Civil Rights; and the shifting role of gender in nineteenth-century politics. Through the exploration and discussion of these issues, participants will gain a broader understanding of how social mores, geographic borders, and place influenced the policies and politicians of the United States in the critical years leading up to and following the Civil War.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Teachers College Center on History and Education and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture convened a group of historians and educators to address the issue of growing historical illiteracy among K-12 learners. Dr. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, Director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, gave opening remarks. The discussion that followed, which was video recorded, elaborated on the role historical literacy plays in challenging American social and economic inequality. Participants identified the local level as the entry point for engaging young learners in the study of history as it matters to the quality of their lives and communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to the HTDL collection and its metadata, and to the tools and functionalities developed by the HTRC that leverage these resources. Through the concrete instances of the HTRC tools, the workshop will orient attendees about the new challenges and opportunities that the ability to carry out algorithmic text analysis at such a large scale presents to researchers. The workshop will cover the Secure Hathi Analytics Research Commons (SHARC), the HathiTrust+Bookworm (HT+BW) tool and the HTRC Extracted Features Dataset. Attendees will be shown how to build their own worksets (small, customized subcorpora from the HathiTrust Digital Library corpus) and how to conduct analyses on worksets. There will also be group discussion involving all attendees about the emerging questions that these novel developments are likely to inaugurate in their own fields and about how these developments can affirm or disrupt (or both affirm and disrupt simultaneously) established practices of inquiry.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The HathiTrust (HT) is a research consortium and digital library consisting of more than 13 million volumes of digitized text, mostly from the world's foremost research libraries. A large part of this material is under copyright and hence not directly downloadable. The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) has started developing facilities for non-consumptive access to the text data by providing innovative means of analytical access (without allowing download-access) to the text data. The workshop is intended for students and researchers interested in textual analytics using the HTRC corpus. Sayan Bhattacharyya, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the HTRC, will showcase different approaches/mechanisms for non-consumptive analysis of the HT corpus, such as a portal, an HTRC Data Capsule, an Extracted Features (EF) dataset based on a subset of the corpus, and an HT+Bookworm tool for trend analysis on the corpus.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This panel "Reconsidering Harald Szeemann" moderated by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, guest scholar at the Getty Research Institute (GRI), artistic director of dOCUMENTA (13) (2012), and curator of the 14th Istanbul Biennial (2015), explored the work and legacy of Swiss curator Harald Szeemann (1933–2005), whose provocative and groundbreaking exhibitions have exerted a lasting influence on the field of contemporary art and exhibition-making. Much of Szeemann's practice was centered around close collaborative relationships with more than 20,000 artists and a sweeping global vision of culture, that influenced the development of more than 200 exhibitions over a career that spanned nearly 50 years. Many projects, such as When Attitudes Become Form in 1969 and documenta 5 in 1972, were controversial and harshly criticized, but over time they have become landmark exhibitions of their era. The Harald Szeemann Archive and Library was acquired by the Getty Research Library in 2011, that now provides free public access to this immense resource of research materials chronicling Szeemann's work and practice though meticulously preserved documents, photographs, and other items. Accelerated Szeemann archive processing and public access was made possible through this generous NEH-HCRR grant.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper focuses on the presence of Agent Orange in Vietnamese culture and memory.  Not only is dioxin, the toxic byproduct of Agent Orange, found in Vietnamese soil, fish, plants, and human breast milk, but Vietnamese culture is steeped in Agent Orange.  Just about every school child and every tourist in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) will visit the War Remnants Museum—a peace museum, a historical museum, and a museum that interprets, teaches, and constructs the history of the American War and, especially, the history of Agent Orange as a chemical weapon that harmed and continues to harm the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese children.  This paper walks through the museum, stops at certain points in the Agent Orange exhibits, and then focuses on a surgical scene in the Agent Orange exhibit.  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The photographs and objects that make up this particular section are an example of the warring themes in the museum's exhibit of Agent Orange. The photographs and the exhibits overall drive home the message that the nation of Vietnam and the Vietnamese are victims of Agent Orange. At the same time, the museum subtly insists that the people disabled as a result of Agent Orange are not victims; they are active people, who have made lives for themselves.  Yet, so many of the photographs—most taken by Western photographers—participate in what disabilities activists and scholars have named "the medical model" for they suggest that Western medicine and heroic surgery are the solution for disabled bodies.  These large and prominently displayed images rely upon and project older Western narratives of disability that put people with unusual bodies on display as freaks in side shows or regarded them as pitiful beings in need of help.  The presence and power of these images also suggest the difficulty of undermining those traditional views of people with disabilities, regardless of the intentions of museum curators. &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The workshop was held at Georgetown University in Washington, DC on Friday March 11 and Saturday March 12, 2016. The theme of the workshop was the philosophy of Robert Grosseteste and Richard Rufus of Cornwall. A group of scholars working on the philosophical thought of these figures shared their work on them with each other.  In addition to helping understand these philosophers better, the organizer hoped the conference would increase awareness of the importance of Richard Rufus and Robert Grosseteste. Presenters were Richard Rufus Project (RRP) editors, Neil Lewis and Rega Wood  who introduced Richard Rufus and explained the significance of Grosseteste's influence on Rufus; a past RRP contributor, R. James Long, who helped clarify Rufus' attacks on Richard Fishacre; Santiago Melo-Arias, who has been preparing English translations  for the RRP website, on Rufus's fundamental ontological views; Wood again, with Rufus on Universals; Chris Martin on the relevance of Rufus' understanding of Aristotelian epistemology to contemporary disputes; Jennifer Ottman on the influence of Rufus; and Timothy Noone, the only presenter without an affiliation with RRP, on Rufus' critical response to St. Bonaventure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The family—its purpose, conventions, and importance—is a subject of persistent inquiry in the humanities, and its definition varies notably in central texts of the Western intellectual tradition. In historical and contemporary contexts, the family is construed in remarkably differing ways: as alternately natural and artificial; necessary and unnecessary; rational and irrational; civilizing and corrupting; local and global; and primary and subordinate to the public sphere. As the family is variably defined (and enacted) in different eras of Western thought, so too are concepts of human nature, morality, and the state, for change to the former surely leads to interrogations and re-conceptualizations of the latter, and vice-versa. This seminar will offer an examination of these varying conceptions of family, introduce seminar participants to critical analyses of them, and conclude with a discussion on teaching about the family in both textual representations and personal life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Contemporary globalization brings to the forefront the relation between identity and spatial location; it highlights new and multiple cross-cutting transnational allegiances that bear on central aspects of Jewish identity, which some contemporary writers and researchers have begun to explore and elaborate. The Venice Ghetto raises a range of questions about Modern Jewish Spaces that have played central roles in Jewish and European culture since the Jews were sequestered in the Ghetto at its founding in 1516. The history of the Ghetto, its image and its symbolic resonances have generated different models that have become subtexts of several Modern Jewish Spaces, often implicitly reverted to in desperate Jewish historical moments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This workshop brings together scholars from a variety of disciplines who work on diverse aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire. While the field of Vijayanagara studies has enjoyed a long period of productive interdisciplinary collaboration among Indian, European, and North American scholars, this collaboration has tended to focus on the Empire's material culture. This makes sense in light of the Empire's extensive art and architectural remains and the voluminous inscriptional records detailing their political, economic, and social significance. As this research on Vijayanagara continues to develop, additional work in Vijayanagara studies is being done in other fields such as literature and religious studies. We propose to conduct a broader interdisciplinary workshop that will expand the types of collaborations on Vijayanagara. The goals of this workshop would be to introduce new scholars and scholarship to the "Vijayanagara scholars" group, and discuss how new findings fit in with previous models. Because the Vijayanagara court's patronage of a variety of economic, cultural, and religious institutions and networks contributed materially to the theoretical and symbolic worlds depicted in the texts, one goal of the proposed conference would be to explore those connections more deeply. Precisely by examining the specific and dynamic links between material and other forms of culture, we might also seek to question the dichotomy between "textual-based" scholarship as pertaining to a theoretical, symbolic world and "artifact-based" scholarship as pertaining to everyday life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While scholars have intensively studied Yugoslavia's weaknesses and dissolution&amp;#x0D; (both in the interwar and post-World War II eras) from political and economic&amp;#x0D; perspectives, there has been less work on the issue of cultural cohesion so crucial&amp;#x0D; to Yugoslavism (the Yugoslav idea) as it was conceived and developed in the nineteenth&amp;#x0D; century and elaborated upon during World War I. In particular, there has&amp;#x0D; been little attempt to interrogate the long-term (1918–today) discursive construction&amp;#x0D; of Yugoslav identity by means of collective memory—that is, the selectively&amp;#x0D; shared stories people tell about themselves in order to give meaning to the ‘nation,'&amp;#x0D; a sense of belonging to the ‘national culture.' And yet from the moment Yugoslavia&amp;#x0D; was created, ordinary Yugoslavists began constructing the Sarajevo assassination&amp;#x0D; as a heroic narrative of opposition and liberation that transcended the particularist&amp;#x0D; identities of ethnicity, nation, religion, and history. How did the different Yugoslav&amp;#x0D; regimes and post-Yugoslav political elites respond to these efforts to shape a collective&amp;#x0D; cultural memory around Gavrilo Princip's political murder of the Archduke&amp;#x0D; Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire? What can the&amp;#x0D; various manifestations of this memory and official attitudes towards it tell us about&amp;#x0D; the Yugoslav national project writ large? These are the main themes addressed in&amp;#x0D; my paper.</Abstract>

By looking at the views of concrete evil held by Mary Astell, Margaret Cavendish, Catharine Macaulay, and Mary Wollstonecraft-- women in the early modern period of philosophy who each are committed attempt to battle concrete, atrocious harm-- today's ethicists can focus on transformative practices to eradicate horrendous evil.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This invited paper observes that the success of the atrocity paradigm's problem of evil argument depends upon the transmutativity aspect of atrocities (i.e., that atrocious harms irrevocably negatively alter the great good of the sufferer's life).  I argue that transmutativity cuts both ways, and that existential hope (as conceived by Gabriel Marcel) functions as a transmuted good by restoring dignity to those who suffer.  If hope is a transmuted good, overrides the consequences of atrocious harm, and emerges from a system of goods that cannot be explained by the atrocity paradigm, then the atheist's conclusion that evil ought to be rescued from theism cannot follow.  Existential hope thus serves as a unique response to the problem of evil.</Abstract>

Further, I contend that, upon analysis, their views map onto contemporary atheist conceptions of evil while forwarding theodical arguments.  I then conclude by sketching out a framework for a new theory of goods, "transmuted goods", which can combat atrocious harm in the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>All ethicists, even atrocity paradigm atheists, want a moral theory to explain why we have positive moral duties to love victims of atrocities.  We should also expect that the atrocity paradigm could account for the ability of some sufferers to recreate meaning in their lives after an atrocity.  The paradigm struggles to do either.&amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D; Instead, certain moral goods—goods like forgiveness, altruism, generosity, or kindness-- provide evidence against the paradigm's view that atrocious harms deprive a person from living a tolerable life. This paper argues that love, as a foundational ‘transmuted good' that functions within a part of a correlative moral system, better explains our moral obligation to others, a universal duty to preserve human dignity, and the ability to create meaning after an atrocity. The result is either that the atrocity paradigm is a flawed moral system, or that theism provides a stronger account of moral obligation to prevent atrocity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper reveals an antinomy in existentialist Gabriel Marcel's conception of evil, and argues that Marcel's view of a feeling of hopeful existence is better understood by working through the antinomy.  Although Marcel clearly argues that evil and suffering are facets of our lived experiences in the world, he is much less clear about whether evil is solvable and what the implications of evil's presence in the world are for what can we can reasonably hope for.  In the following, I map out Marcel's conception of evil onto his fundamental distinction between problem and mystery, show that the distinction creates two effective methodologies for dealing with evil in the world (the problem approach and the mystery approach), draw the antinomy of evil based on these methodologies, and then demonstrate that the antinomy can be dissolved through an existentially-engaged, communal encounter with evil.  Dissolving the antinomy facilitates Marcel's vision of transforming the encounter of evil through a love that brings a feeling of hope—for all, regardless of existential or theistic commitment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will bridge the gap between the analytic, theodical use of second-personal narratives and the atrocious harm arguments of atheists through a relational narrative account that borrows heavily from Flannery O'Connor's sense of intersubjectivity.  Although the project of using narrative as a way to do theodicy should be preserved, this paper will cast doubt on the ability of second-personal narratives to meet the criticisms of the atrocity paradigm, and will instead suggest that first-person plural standpoint can better rescue narrative as a theodical tool. The conditions of intersubjectivity found within O'Connor require more than mere interconnectedness among characters, and more than seeing others as only ‘others,'  but as intrinsically bound up with the sense of self . The result is such that, for narratives to be efficacious in theodicy, they must facilitate:  a)mutual respect between agents, which is absent between the empowered and the oppressed; b) an univocal relationship between agents when a moral claim is made-- although power relationships are frequently equivocal and, for the oppressed, implicitly threatening; and c) a felicity condition in which the addressee has reason to respond to the claim made by the narrative, even though feminists would argue that such a consideration disproportionately negatively impacts women.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rather than assess the merits of the contemporary distinction between abstract and concrete evil, then, we can use it to revisit Leibnizian theodicy to answer, first, whether there is textual support in Theodicy for the distinction, and second, if Leibniz's theodicy can justify divine perfection in the face of atrocious harms. Delineating between concrete, particular and concrete, atrocious harms has several benefits for Leibniz scholarship. This allows Leibnizian theodicy to rigorously (rather than incidentally) engage with concrete evil—and so the Theodicy can duck the atheist's contention that it fails to engage with the lived experience of suffering.  My distinction also removes the burden from Leibniz's theodicy to demonstrate that, for each person who suffers, evil contributes to the good whole of the individual's life, since the concrete evils that are explainable by theodicy are a genre, rather than an instance.  Finally, it preserves Leibniz's view that the goodness of God extends to the particular, relative to the whole, if God's best possible world includes a system of goods that can mitigate the system of atrocious harm perpetuated by evil human action.</Abstract>
