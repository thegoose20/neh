196,FA-55153-10,"Bound up with debates over the origin of labor pain were concerns for how to accurately assess pain's intensity. Most clinical research on the efficacy of psychoprophylaxis centred on judging women's performance based on outward signs of suffering. Grimaces, clenched jaws, crying, and screaming were interpreted as indicators of the method's (or, more often, the woman's) failure. Sceptical of the accuracy of such cues and reluctant to trust the testimony of women themselves, some investigators sought what they touted as more objective measures of pain or predictors of women's pain threshold. For example, Sverdlovsk pharmacology professor A.K. Sangailo developed a machine he called to sensograph, which used electrodes to administer variable electric current to women in order to identify their pain threshold and predict their success or failure using psychoprophylaxis in labour.  Based on extensive archival research in Ukraine and Russia, this paper will analyze medical professional debates over the origin, role, and measurement of pain in childbirth as a window onto questions of mind-body medicine and gender dynamics in the clinical encounter.","Michaels, Paula",European Association for the History of Medicine and Health Conference,9/4/11,http://www.eahmh.net/index.php?option=com content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=58,,,,"Soviet Theories of Labor Pain’s Origin and the Quest for Its Objective Measurement, 1950s-1960s"

Microfilm copies of the papers are scanned and high resolution OCR software is run on them. The text from the OCR provides a wealth of data and opinion for researchers and historians. However, the categorization of articles provided by the OCR engine is rudimentary and a large number of the articles are labeled editorial without further categorization. To provide a more refined grouping of articles, unsupervised machine learning algorithms (such as K-Means) are being investigated. The K-Means algorithm requires tuning of parameters such as the number of clusters and mechanism of seeding to ensure that the search is not prone to being caught in a local minima. We designed a pilot study to observe whether humans are adept at finding sub-categories. The subjective labels provided by humans are used as a guide to compare performance of the automated clustering techniques. In addition, seeds provided by annotators are carefully incorporated into a semi-supervised K-Means algorithm (Seeded K-Means); empirical results indicate that this helps to improve performance and provides an intuitive sub-categorization of the articles labeled ``editorial"" by the OCR engine.

391,FA-55326-10,"In trying to understand the racial turn in conceptions of ethnicity in French America, historians have analyzed language, legal and marital practices, religious discourse and other largely abstract intellectual frameworks. What they have not done is pay attention to the evidence from the couples' daily lives. Rather than situate the debate about intermarriage in terms of intellectual and religious binaries, or positing a clear distinction between the views of Frenchmen in the colony and in France, I propose that we look instead to the material culture of intermarried households. For my analysis suggests that the tensions between supporters and opponents of intermarriage and métissage in Louisiana was primarily located in their degree of familiarity with the exceptional pattern of intermarriage in the Illinois Country, and the way that this was manifested through the frenchified bodies and dwellings emphasized in the locally produced records. The material culture expressions of these couples interfered with the seemingly inexorable rise of racialism in Louisiana, creating its own chronology, and highlighting the uneven development and fractured character of the process of racialization in North America. Or, to put it more compellingly: this evidence helps us grasp the implications of priests in the Illinois Country justifying intermarriage there by asserting, in 1732, that ""there was no difference between a Christian sauvage  and a White.""",Sophie White,McGill University French Atlantic History Group Seminar,4/8/2011,,,,,"““Point de différence entre un sauvage chrétien et un blanc:” Conversion, Frenchification and Material Culture in the Illinois Country”"
392,FA-55326-10,"The 1627 Charter of New France had held out the promise that Indian converts would ""be considered natural Frenchmen,"" ushering in a sequence of failed policies aimed at frenchifying (""franciser"") Indians. By the time the Illinois Country was settled in the late seventeenth century, the premise of frenchification—that identity was mutable—had been largely displaced by proto-racial beliefs. Yet it would be here that missionaries and officials began to claim that women converts married to Frenchmen, and their progeny, had achieved Frenchness. They married in the Church, had their children baptized, and eventually lived not in Indian villages, but within French colonial houses in segregated French settlements, wearing French dress. In other words, they presented visual and material evidence of having frenchified, with the result that local officials and missionaries granted them the legal rights of Frenchmen. Rather than interpreting this adoption of French material culture as assimilation into the colonial order, I propose instead a gendered analysis that showcases the persistence of indigenous beliefs, thereby illuminating the authority of this group of women to define community through material culture.",Sophie White,American Historical Association,1/8/2012,,,,,"“No difference between a Christian Indian and a Frenchman:” Identity, Community and Material Culture"

Marthewas not been accorded the spiritual rank of a full choir nun but only that of a converse (or domestic) nun. This nuance raises questions about how the Ursulines understood race with respect to Indians in mid-18th century New Orleans, especially when juxtaposed with their response one year later to a violent attack by a Frenchman on the body of one of their female (African) slaves. Asked if they planned to make their own declaration against the accused soldier, the Ursulines stated that the members of the convent (Marie Turpin among them) wished in no way ""to get involved in this affair, neither as accusers nor as defendants,"" that on the contrary, they would rather their slave die than do anything against ""the charity owed to"" fellow French men and women. For both events, a key part of the evidence of the Ursulines' views of Indian and African members of their communities was produced by the nuns themselves, allowing us to contextualize how women accustomed to writing biographies for every member of their order responded when required to describe female ""others.""",Sophie White,"Institute on ""Le français à la mesure d’un  continent : un patrimoine en   partage"" (Laval University-Tulane University)",5/31/2012,,,,,"""Les Limites de l'inclusion: Femmes Amerindiennes et Africaines dans un couvent de la Nouvelle-Orleans"

A common dimension of the exile experience is the refusal to relinquish affective ties to the place of origin. Because of the need to remain connected to a distant place that does not exist anymore, spatial devices - orientation, proximity and distance, directionality, mapping, and navigation – figure prominently in Cuban exile narratives. Though political exiles such as Miami's Cuban diaspora cannot literally return to Cuba, they preserve detailed maps of home in their hearts and minds which allow them to visit often.  Interviews and video from the 2011 Cuba Nostalgia Festival are used to explore how enormous floor maps of Havana, Cardenas, and the country of Cuba are utilized by exiles. The maps prompt exiles to look back in time and space to the Cuba of their childhood, as well as to establish new connections in the present among those whose memories center on the same places.

The colossal project of the Encyclopédie (1751-1772), directed by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, aimed to create, as Voltaire contends, ""a repository of all sciences and arts,"" therefore establishing itself as the point of reference for literature, sciences, arts and crafts. This pretentious ambition contrasts in direct proportion with the peripheral depiction of Francis Petrarch. Although they acknowledge Petrarch's poetic talent and innovation, the authors of the Encyclopédie confine the Tuscan poet within the French poetical tradition. This gesture of appropriating what is exterior to the French image can be partly justified by the objective of the encyclopédistes to design a venue where a homogenous French identity can emerge.

746,FA-50250-04,"Keynote Address: About ten years ago, I began a long project about elephants which has focused on a basic historical question: why do we think about elephants in  the ways we have and do? It seemed obvious enough at the start that a great deal of what most people in the West think about elephants has very  little to do with the animals' actual lives and experiences in either their native range countries or in all the other places they have lived in traveled  over the last couple of hundred years. Simple questions about where such ideas as elephants never forget or elephants never strike out without  cause seemed to beg for some kind of historical study, especially since it was clear that ideas about elephants (like so many other animals) had  obviously changed so much in recent centuries. This presentation is a bookend to a paper I gave at the 2002 ISAZ meeting in London, and focuses  on the parts of elephants preserved in private and public collections, and what these collections can tell us about the ways we have come to think  about these animals. If the elephants of hunting accounts, zoos, circuses, and Hollywood have been asked (and some would say forced) to perform,  if their apparent resistance could even become an important part of the spectacles, in this paper I will look at what is left of elephants after they  have died, after they have become almost only a part of human history",Nigel Rothfels,20th Annual Confernece of the e International Society for Anthrozoology,08/06/2011,http://www.isaz.net/conferences/ISAZ%20Program%20Book.pdf,,,,The Elephant Remains

They were an avenue within the university system for motivating students and regulating university curriculum—an important concern during the enlightenment period as the major Scottish Universities were moving away from Scholasticism in attempts to prepare their students for a widening range of careers—both in Scottish cites and to the south, in London. As City Comp attests, urban educational concerns often bridge ""town and gown,"" as was certainly true in Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities, the hotbeds of Scottish enlightenment. In varying degrees both universities were governed in part by town councils, and educational reform was driven by local occupational, economic, and social concerns.  Outside the classroom, contests advanced critical thought, helped homogenize language use, and ensured the widespread recognition of competition sponsors' principles and beliefs. As the Scots struggled over issues of nationalism and conformity, contests called attention to both concerns by bringing recognition to issues of national pride while simultaneously serving to align the Scots with both English and Continental thought and practice. The contests of the period shed light on cultural and educational identification issues of the time, but also provide historical illustrations of contemporary theories connecting composition instruction and production to issues of liminal space and physical place where the boundaries between the classroom, public discourse, business and industry shift and sometimes dissolve.",Lynee Lewis Gaillet,South-Central Eighteenth-Century Studies Conference,02/17/2011,http://www.scsecs.net/scsecs/2011/program.html,Conference website.

Jardine instructed many Scots who later immigrated to North America and held prestigious positions within higher education and religious circles. In particular, the educational practices of Alexander Campbell at Bethany College and James McCosh at Princeton College clearly bear the mark of Scottish philosophy and pedagogy as codified in Jardine's foundational treatise The Outlines of Philosophical Education (1818, 1825). To demonstrate ways in which Jardine's rhetorical theory (based on Scottish Common Sense Realism and Baconian scientific induction) served American democratic philosophies of education, I would like today to recount Jardine's reputation as the spokesperson for the early nineteenth-century Scottish pedagogical system and illuminate his influence within the teaching philosophies of Campbell and McCosh.",Lynee Lewis Gaillet,"Eighteenth-Century Scottish Studies Society.

13017,FA-232749-16,"This talk explores the complicated world of the eastern Mediterranean in the late fifth and sixth centuries in the topsy-turvy decades after the emperor Marcian affirmed the orthodoxy of the Council of Chalcedon in 451, a doctrine that remained hotly contested as subsequent emperors supported one side and then another of the debates, and positions proliferated further in response to ongoing efforts at compromise.  In 475, for example, the usurper Basiliscus issued an Encyclical that rejected Chalcedon, but ‘flip-flopped' just months later in his Anti-encyclical.  The emperor Zeno (r. 474-5, 476-91) hoped to find an acceptable compromise when he issued the Henotikon in 482, but since only some from each side supported the compromise, it fractured the church further.  After Zeno's death, many (but not all) anti-Chalcedonian Christians temporarily enjoyed support from the emperor Anastasius (r. 491-518), but the subsequent reign of Justin I (r. 518-27) was filled with more aggressive pro-Chalcedonian policies. Justin's successor Justinian (r. 527-65), with the empress Theodora, renewed efforts to find a compromise, but they were ultimately unsuccessful; the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 largely signaled an end to these efforts, and the reign of Justin II (r. 565-74) that followed became increasingly hostile to those who opposed imperial (i.e., Chalcedonian) orthodoxy.  In this context the markers of Christian orthodoxy were contested and its definition by any measure was wildly unstable.  In this chaos some Christians identified orthodoxy by imperial support (despite shifting doctrine), some patronized a particular church building (despite changing bishops), some adhered to a particular doctrine or followed a particular bishop as their fortunes waxed and waned, and still others seem to have hoped that their personal devotion to a life of asceticism would stand as a secure bulwark against doctrinal uncertainty.",Christine Shepardson,"Center for Late Ancient Studies, Duke University",7/15/2017,,,,,Hell of a Wrong Eucharist: Ritual Distinction and Community Identity in 6th-c.

13018,FA-232749-16,"This paper today will discuss John Rufus's Plerophoriae, from the anti-Chalcedonian monastic stronghold of Maiuma (Gaza) in the early sixth century during the supportive reign of the emperor Anastasius.  This essay argues that John Rufus deployed earlier saints' vivid visions of heaven and hell to forcefully pressure sixth-century Christians to avoid contact with anyone or any place associated with Chalcedonian Christianity.  Many visions and prophecies in this text, in fact, suggest that the Eucharist in particular should be understood as a focal point of the controversy, and that Chalcedonian and anti-Chalcedonian Christians were not nearly as distinct as John Rufus would have liked.  In another chapter of this project, I demonstrate that John of Ephesus's later texts claimed that late sixth-century anti-Chalcedonian Christians faced financial, social, political, and sometimes violent physical pressures to accept the Chalcedonian Eucharist.  I believe that examining the ways in which John Rufus earlier deployed depictions of an imminent afterlife and the Eucharist ritual in relation to the Chalcedonian controversy allows us to imagine daily interactions and concerns of early sixth-century Christians (and their leaders) in new and productive ways.",Christine Shepardson,"Regional Late Antiquity Consortium, University of Kentucky",7/15/2017,,,,,"Remembering the Future: Heaven, Hell, and the Eucharist in John Rufus (fl. 500-18)."
13019,FA-232749-16,"In the late sixth century, the Christian leader John of Ephesus (ca. 507-88/9) wrote his Church History and Lives of the Eastern Saints.  By the middle of the seventh century, Muhammad's followers had taken control of many of the regions where anti-Chalcedonian (Miaphysite) Christians survived despite decades of imperial pressure, and by the late seventh and early eighth century, Muslims began to welcome non-Arab converts to Islam more freely.  In response, Syriac-speaking anti-Chalcedonian Christians produced texts like the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius [ca. 692, Miaph, 100km SE Nis] to combat the growing threat they believed Muslims posed to their community.  While scholars have studied Pseudo-Methodius's Apocalypse in this context, none have added John of Ephesus's texts to the discussion.  The only surviving manuscript of John's Lives (567-9) was produced in 688; part III of his Church History (577-88) appears to be written by the same scribe; and part II of his Church History (567-71) survives in one ninth-century manuscript that Pseudo-Dionysius incorporated into his Chronicle in the late eighth century.  This paper will highlight some of the thematic echoes between John of Ephesus's writings as they were preserved during the rise of Islam and the contemporaneous Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius (and were there time, thanks to Michael Penn's work, I could add John bar Penkaye's, Book of Main Points [ca. 687, E-Syr, 100km NE Nis], the Edessene Apocalypse [early 690s, Miaph, Ed], and the Apocalypse of John the Little [early 8th c, Miaph, Ed?]).  In this paper, I argue that John's texts, with their strong arguments about remaining steadfast in (anti-Chalcedonian) Christianity in the face of government persecutions and financial and political incentives to apostatize, resonated with Syriac-speaking anti-Chalcedonian Christians not only against the Chalcedonian empire of the sixth century, but also against Muslims in the late seventh and eighth centuries.",Christine Shepardson,"Society  of Biblical Literature, San Antonio",11/15/2016,,,,,Persisting in Religious Truth: Reading John of Ephesus during the Rise of Islam
13020,FA-232749-16,"In the early sixth century, John Rufus circulated stories of saints' visions and prophecies that he argued proved the invalidity of the Council of Chalcedon (451), and in turn the orthodoxy of his own non-Chalcedonian community.  In some cases, John reported that a written document anathematizing the council had descended from heaven itself in the presence of witnesses.  John represented these stories as fifth-century predictions about, and early responses to, Chalcedon, but comparison with the writings of his contemporary non-Chalcedonian colleague Severus of Antioch reveals the powerful role that the stories of heavenly anathematizations of Chalcedon played in John's own context.  For his part, Severus explicitly mentioned sixth-century Christians' concerns about rejecting a council that had as many trappings of episcopal and imperial legitimacy as Chalcedon did.  Citing scripture and earlier church councils and saints, Severus argued that since the Council of Chalcedon had strayed from orthodoxy, neither it nor the clergy who adhered to it had the authority to anathematize or otherwise censor truly orthodox (non-Chalcedonian) Christians. With the methodical tools of his legal training, Severus countered his audience's fears that they and their clergy might be separated from God and the church on account of their rejection of this council, encouraging them to remain faithful to non-Chalcedonian clergy through the long-lasting conflicts. This essay will position John Rufus's Plerophoriae in his own time by reading its miraculous stories of heavenly anathemas in light of Severus of Antioch's concrete writings about earthly ones.",Christine Shepardson,"North American Patristics Society, Chicago",05/01/2017,,,,,Anathemas from Heaven: John Rufus and Severus on Chalcedonian Claims of Legitimacy
13023,RA-50126-14,"Recent events have underscored the danger that cow protection poses to religious and caste minorities in India, as Dalits and Muslims allegedly suspected of cattle-slaughter have been brutally assaulted or killed. These events have followed the strengthening of anti-slaughter laws.  Such laws originate with Article 48 of the Constitution of India, which directs the state to ""endeavour to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines"" and to ""take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter"" of cattle. In 1958, the Supreme Court cited Article 48 when it ruled it constitutional for the states to prohibit the slaughter of female cows.  Article 48 has been described as the product of a secularist compromise, in which Ambedkar and Nehru succeeded in couching cow protectionists' religious demands for a ban on cow-slaughter in the more neutral language of science and agriculture. But as Chigateri (2011, p. 146) has observed, Article 48 ""reiterates the Hindu basis"" of opposition to cow slaughter. As the restriction of slaughter came to be justified on secular grounds, minority rights were submerged or erased.  There was also a ""Hindu basis"" to the ostensibly secular framing of Article 48. Cow protectionists had used agricultural reasoning since Dayanand Saraswati in 1881. This paper details how such reasoning acquired a scaffolding of official and expert support in the last decades before independence. The colonial state has been praised for its secular stance on cow protection: colonial officials refused cow protectionists' demands by invoking the principle of religious neutrality, citing Muslims' right to sacrifice cattle at Bakr Id. Nonetheless, by 1948, alliances between colonial officials and cow protectionists had blurred any distinction between a secular or scientific concern with breed improvement, and a Hindu religious concern with preserving cattle life.",Catherine Adcock,American Historical Association Annual Meeting 2018,01/04/2018,https://aha.confex.com/aha/2018/webprogram/Paper23446.html,,,,Preserving and Improving the Breeds: Colonial Cow Protection and the Prehistory of a Constitutional Directive
13057,HB-231968-16,"Robert Solomon's ""On grief and gratitude"" is perhaps the best known contemporary philosophical article on grief. There Solomon makes the provocative claim that there is a duty to grieve – that those who do not grieve or do not grieve sufficiently are subject to ""the most severe moral censure,"" that as a ""moral emotion,"" grief is not only an ""appropriate reaction to the loss of a loved one, but also in a strong sense obligatory."" While Solomon offer reasons why grief speaks positively of a person's relations with others and why grief may contribute to the bereaved's well-being, he does not offer an explicit argument for the obligatoriness of grief. Here I consider a number of routes by which such a claim might be defended. If there is a duty to grieve, its object must be other living people (those with whom one shares grief at a particular person's death), the deceased for whom one grieves, or oneself. The first two, I argue, are likely to be candidates for duties of mourning, i.e., duties to engage in public or ritualistic memorialization or acknowledgements of the deceased's death, etc. Only the last, a duty to grieve owed to oneself, is a credible candidate for a duty to grieve. For insofar as grief is an egocentric activity, it responds to the death of a person with whom one stands in an identity-constituting relationship and hence involves the attempt to re-establish or place on new terms that relationship in light of that individual's death. The source of a self-concerning duty to grieve is that grief thus represents both an opportunity for, and motivator of, self-knowledge, that is, knowledge of one's practical identity and values. The duty to grieve, I conclude, is a non-enforceable duty to oneself whose non-fulfillment should elicit agent-centered regret.",Michael Cholbi,American Philosophical Association Eastern Division Meeting,01/06/18,,,,,The Duty to Grieve

13068,FA-232534-16,"A critical part of the conversion of 1.5 million Belarusian and Ukrainian Uniates to Orthodoxy in the 1830s involved transforming the all Uniate church interiors to meet the requirements for Orthodox services. This involved building iconostases, as well as removing organs and pulpits.  Additionally, impressive edifices were needed to house Orthodox cathedrals; these were, where possible, created by adding Orthodox elements to Roman Catholic churches that had been damaged or closed by the Russian authorities. This paper will investigate the extraordinary effort involved in carrying out these mandates, as well as the wide-spread difficulties in funding and implementing them, and assess the degree to which the religious landscape and material culture in Russia's western provinces lost many expressions of Polish and Catholic influence and began to reflect instead the Orthodox culture and modes of worship that were linked to Russia.",Barbara Skinner,"Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies annual convention, Washington, D.C",11/20/16,,,,,"“Iconostases and Cathedrals: Creating Orthodox Sacred Spaces in Russia’s Western Borderlands, 1828-1855”"

American colonial authorities had downplayed Filipino opposition to the leper segregation policy. This paper examines how gender-based assumptions, state policies, and practices influenced reports on how the patients responded to gender segregation within the leper colony. Initially implemented in 1907, restrictions on marriage and cohabitation generated several protests, including the 1932 protest dubbed ""The Manchuria."" There is a paucity of sources written by the patients, but there are newspaper articles, government reports, and accounts of American colonial officials, nuns, and priests.   This paper seeks to advance our understanding of Filipino leprosy patients' engagement with American colonial authorities. This is an understudied theme in the existing literature on empire and public health policy and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines.

These Chicana/o civil rights activists invoked the nineteenth-century conflict to raise awareness of Mexican Americans' poverty and disenfranchisement in the twentieth century. In a 1971 march throughout the U.S. Southwest, the Brown Berets created alternative monuments to Mexican Americans who had fought on Mexico's behalf during the U.S.-Mexico War and also attempted to raise the Mexican flag at war landmarks as a reminder of Mexico's former claim to the land. This activism, I argue, illustrates activists' strategic use of war memories and the links between social and political issues. Each time activists recalled the war in their pamphlets, speeches, and/or media interviews, they reminded the nation of the long-term social consequences of the U.S.-Mexico War, the unfulfilled promises of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the justifications for civil rights activism.

Perceptual studies have revealed a number of verbal attributes that reliably map onto timbral qualities, but the conventions of timbre description in spoken and written discourse remain poorly understood. Books on orchestration and instrumentation provide a valuable source of natural language used to describe qualities of instrumental timbre. Using methods from corpus linguistics, in this study I explore the conceptual features of timbre description through a quantitative analysis of a corpus of eleven popular orchestration treatises and manuals.  Timbre descriptors were manually extracted from the corpus, producing a total frequency of 3666 words (tokens) and 879 unique types. The five most frequent adjectives used to describe instrumental timbre were brilliant, rich, dark, full, and bright; the mean frequency was 4.5, and 12% of the dataset consisted of words or expressions that only occurred once. Data were also subdivided by instrument. To explore the underlying semantic structure of the word list, categories were generated through an inductive sorting process. The categorization scheme was validated with inter-rater reliability analysis, revealing seven conceptual classes of timbre descriptors: affect, matter, metaphor, mimesis, action, acoustics, and onomatopoeia. Log-linear analyses indicated statistically significant differences of category membership between orchestral instruments. I interpret these novel results through the lens of embodied music cognition and conceptual metaphor theory, and close with a discussion of the implications of this study for our broader understanding of the semantic space of timbre.","Wallmark, Zachary","Society for Music Perception and Cognition Biannual Meeting, San Diego",8/1/2017,,,,,Timbre Semantics in Orchestration: A Corpus-Linguistic Study

The project takes its name from the only copy of Latin Jubilees, which is joined by the only copies anywhere of the Testament of Moses and an Arian commentary on the Gospel of Luke. After the successful imaging of these erased texts in January of 2017, the scope of objects of interest broadened to other significant palimpsests at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, such as Origen's Hexapla and a fourth-century translation of biblical books into Gothic.

A continental-sized nation with poor infrastructure, Brazilian government agencies sought to improve their knowledge of and management of the vast country through systematic and extensive data collection and reporting. This interest in data collection was part of an international movement spearheaded by statistical societies and spread through international congresses that viewed statistical data as a means to improve exchange. The paper investigates the institutional history of the census and adoption of the metric system in 1872, focusing on the politics and policies behind their conception and design and the logistics of their implementation. It analyzes these innovations to tell the story of how Brazilian political leaders came to see them as valuable endeavors and how they envisioned the utility of both.",Anne G.

13156,RA-235170-16,"Ramlila is an annual performance tradition in India that tells the story of the Hindu god Ram, typically over 10-15 days but sometimes up to a month. It has evolved from a recitative-pantomime style of ritualized performance on unbounded field(s) to a culturally hybrid form of mimetic theatre on an open-air proscenium stage. Drawing on extensive research at over twenty Ramlilas in the state of Uttar Pradesh, this paper considers the distinctive role of the svarups or those who play the parts of the divine leads. Beginning with the celebrated Ramlila at Ramnagar, this paper argues that conventions at this ‘preservationist' Ramlila work to performatively replicate existing social and gender hierarchies and normativities in Indian society, ones rooted in the nineteenth century when it was founded. Moving to ‘ordinary' neighborhood Ramlilas, it further suggests that although such productions are often more progressive in their casting, many of the actors who step onto the Ramlila stage are compelled to simultaneously enact a number of social embodiments, and this is especially true of the men who play the parts of svarups and female characters, and also the professional dancers who are sometimes brought in to entertain and occasionally, signal moral depravity. In sum, this paper shows that those who do the affective work of performing divinity and gender in Ramlila must conform to certain social expectations around class, caste, gender, and even skin tone.",Pamela Lothspeich,Association for Asian Studies annual conference,03/23/2018,https://www.eventscribe.com/2018/AAS/biography.asp?h=Participants,web site for the Association for Asian Studies annual conference,,,Embodied Divinities and Professional Dancers on the Ramlila Stage

13267,HB-232187-16,"This paper will examine the multiple ways the Brown Berets contested memories of conquest during their 1971 march throughout the U.S. Southwest. In the course of their ""Caravana de la Reconquista,"" the Berets collected, interpreted, and promoted collective war memories. They visited various sites in the U.S. Southwest with ties to the U.S.-Mexico War, and invoked collective memories of the war to contest the nation's official history of the conflict. The Berets' symbolic ""reconquest"" of the region relied on reminding the region's residents of the tragic consequences of the U.S. conquest, challenging the ""conquered"" mentality among some Mexican Americans, and asserting Chicanos' claim to the land and to U.S. citizenship. These Chicana/o civil rights activists ""remembered"" the nineteenth-century conflict to raise awareness of Mexican Americans' contemporary poverty and disenfranchisement in the twentieth century. By linking the long-term consequences of the U.S.-Mexico War to the continued subordination of Mexican Americans, the Berets strategically used war memories to advance their political agenda. They highlighted Chicanos' continued subordination and its origins in the U.S.-Mexico War, detailed problems facing the Chicano community, and challenged official public memories of the nation's westward expansion. At various sites along their expedition, the Brown Berets also created alternative monuments to Mexican Americans who had fought on Mexico's behalf during the U.S.-Mexico War or who had fought to defend the Mexican community against European American attacks. Moreover, by recalling the war and the treaty's promises in their campaigns and press releases, activists reinforced and modified their communities' collective memories, thus transmitting war memories across several generations.

To explore this tension, we describe a current collaborative project that brings together anthropologists and Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl) to create a critical, annotated, digital edition of Franz Boas's first Northwest Coast monograph. In this 1897 text, Boas provided a typological foundation for concurrent and future museum classification of masks and other ritual regalia, along with their ceremonially associated songs, dances, and charter narratives. However, in this typological mode, multiple instantiations of diverse hereditary prerogatives became mere tokens of a common type, thereby stripping out core cultural meanings. Our current challenge is to build a digital metadata structure responsive to Indigenous ontologies of the object where the immaterial—genealogical rights and title to specific masks—is more durable and essential than the material. In such cases, ephemeral genealogical data might be the most significant ""artifacts"" to preserve—a point forcefully made by Boas's primary Native collaborator, George Hunt, over the decades of their work together.","Aaron Glass, Judith Berman",American Anthropological Association Annual Meeting,12/02/17,https://www.eventscribe.net/2017/AAA/assets/pdf/AAA2017 Program BOOK v2.pdf,,,,"What is a Mask?

Moholy-Nagy, who was exiled in England at the time, had been a member of the Bauhaus faculty and was a close associate of Gropius, who had turned down the Association's offer to lead the school.  Although the New Bauhaus was forced to close in 1938 after less than a year in operation due to the Association's withdrawal of financial support, Container Corporation president Walter Paepcke helped Moholy to establish the School of Design in Chicago in 1939, which retained the Bauhaus pedagogy and much of its faculty, including the Hungarian artist György Kepes.  Moholy led the design school, which changed its name to the Institute of Design in 1944, until his death in 1946.  Drawing on archival resources at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois, Chicago, this paper looks at Moholy's immigration to the United States and his close relationship with Paepcke, an arts patron who created jobs for other Bauhaus designers including Herbert Bayer.

This production method has come to be called the Three Sisters. This presentation examines Three Sisters agriculture from the ground up, in order to contextualize how this cropping practice interacts with the environment it is placed into, particularly considering the impact on soil, and to more fully understand it's value as a food production method in 4 midwestern Native communities. Cultural ties in these Native communities to this cropping practice run very deep. Historically, Native Nations who chose to grow biodiverse cropping systems were able to combine the different characteristics within each plant to create a high-yielding environment that would allow them to harvest enough food not only to survive until the next growing season, but to fuel a robust trade economy. Because different plant species respond to challenging environmental issues in different ways, Native Nations using this cropping practice appears to be more sustainable than the modern practice of growing fields of a single-species monocrop when dealing with adverse weather events. Learning how different Native Nations interact with their Three Sisters gardens and the soils that support them may help motivate other Native people to consider gardening and enjoy the benefits.","Derrick Kapayou, Christina Gish Hill","Food Sovereignty Symposium and Festival, Keweenaw Bay Indian Community",5/22/2022,https://food-sovereignty.com/schedule/,Food Sovereignty Symposium Schedule,,,"""A Look At Three Sisters Agriculture From the Ground Up”"

24216,AC-277694-21,"This paper explores how historical recreation, particularly with handpress printing, can help us understand our own multi-/remediated era and new scholarly techniques in the digital humanities. We draw from our work with graduate and undergraduate students from UCSB, Cal State-Northridge, and Howard University on the Ballitore Project, a research initiative that brings together archival and digital methods to study the Ballitore Collection, an archive of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century correspondence held at UCSB Library's Special Research Collections. The project's summer internship involves students from the three campuses working at UCSB to learn skills in topic modeling and network analysis in order to visualize the archival materials in new ways. At the same time, they use the pull press housed in UCSB's Maker Lab to print a poem from the collection, which was originally assembled by the Anglo-Irish author Mary Leadbeater. Many of Leadbeater's poetry drafts are stored in the collection; in order to print them, students must make decisions about which versions to use and how to deal with erratic line breaks and inconsistent spelling. This process helps us understand the history of printing, in which eighteenth-century compositors would have to make similar decisions when setting Leadbeater's poems. But more importantly, it helps us think about processes of remediation and what is gained and lost not only in transforming manuscripts into print, but also in digitizing historical manuscripts and printed books. It reveals how Leadbeater did not see print as the apotheosis of her literary practice, but rather as one stage of production that would often be amended or superseded by later manuscript work. The process of setting type and printing reveals the multimedia nature of Leadbeater's authorial approach, of her initial archiving of the materials in the Ballitore Collection, and of the present-day process of digitization and computational analysis.",John Henry Merritt,American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies,3/11/2023,https://www.asecs.org/ files/ugd/acf0d2 452f261189d94eb4b4588436648e196f.pdf,,,,Printing and Digitizing: Historical Recreation in the Ballitore Project

Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor call for a shift in scholarly models ""from one based on individual rights to a model based on a feminist ethics of care."" This presentation will discuss a project that seeks to put into practice ethics of care in a collaborative project building a digital scholarly edition of archival materials. The Ballitore Project, a collaboration between UCSB, CSUN, and Howard University, investigates an archive of 18th- and 19th-century Irish Quaker correspondence held at UCSB Library's Special Research Collections. While the Ballitore Quakers were a small, provincial community—and the collection itself centers on the close-knit Shackleton family—they engaged political causes such as abolitionism, but this was a paternalistic abolitionism that entirely excluded Black voices from their correspondence. In the process of creating a digital edition of the collection for public access, the Ballitore Project seeks to address such absences by foregrounding collaborative, non-hierarchical research teams that draw from racially and socioeconomically diverse students and that cross the borders between campuses, between faculty, student, and librarians, and between pedagogy and research. The collaboration has also recently grown to include the public through the use of the Zooniverse platform for crowd-sourcing transcriptions. A care framework helps us address the problems and contradictions within the collection while valuing Quaker ideals of egalitarianism both in the past and present.","Rachael Scarborough King, Danielle Spratt",Modern Language Association Annual Meeting,1/6/2023,https://mla.confex.com/mla/2023/meetingapp.cgi,,,,Care Across Borders in Digital Scholarly Editions
24219,AC-277694-21,"One of the Romantic period's most significant and prominent public rhetorical campaigns was that of the abolitionist campaign, which emerged in Great Britain in the late eighteenth century with a focus on ending the trade in enslaved humans. Quakers have been credited with an outsized role in the effort, as they represented nine out of the twelve founding members of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. But at the same time, Quaker abolitionism was often not antiracist, with many Quakers advocating ""repatriation"" for formerly enslaved people. This paper will take a book historical approach to such contradictions using the materials of the Ballitore Collection, an archive of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Irish Quaker materials held at UCSB Library's Special Research Collections. The collection shows how Quakers outside London created consensus around abolitionism, as they circulated letters with excerpts from the correspondence of other prominent Quakers—such as Edward Rushton and John Woolman—advocating for abolition. For example, in 1807, Samuel Haughton sent his friend Mary Leadbeater a letter in which he excerpted a separate letter from Rushton to John Hancock in which Rushton noted, ""I wish politicians &amp; philosophers would learn to be consistant Jefferson the president of the united states, the freest country in the world, holds hundreds of his fellow creatures in a state of bondage, and Horne Tooke the celebrated English patriot is an enemy to the abolition of the slave trade"" [sic].

24244,AKA-265769-19,"Interdisciplinary courses have played a key role in teaching challenging and complex issues to students.  Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and humanities fields (i.e., arts, reading, music, etc.) have been blended to cultivate creative thinking and problem-solving, particularly for STEM students.  Expanding these efforts, the Texas Tech University (TTU) Honors College has created humanities-driven STEM (HDSTEM) courses.  These HDSTEM courses are team-taught with a STEM and humanities faculty.  Because the humanities have been argued to produce students with higher levels of empathy, an HDSTEM course was devised that blends technical problem-solving with the humanities and asks students to empathize.  Discourse and content analysis of problem-solving assignments was performed to analyze changes in empathetic depositions for Honors students.  An empathy rubric was used to baseline and score empathy levels as students progressed through the course.  Students' problem-solving assignments generally showed more empathetic positioning during the semester than at the start of the semester.  This HDSTEM course successfully blended STEM and humanities by having students consider technical and ""hard science"" aspects of their assignments while asking them to empathize and think more deeply about the discipline's social, political, and ethical implications.  Further, this work shows that the humanities within a STEM context can foster an empathetic disposition.  This session will discuss the results of this study, provide details on how HDSTEM is being further implemented within TTU's Honors curriculum, and discuss lessons learned for implementation into other colleges/programs.","John Carrell, Joshua Cruz",National Council of Honors Colleges Annual Conference,11/5/2022,,,,,Understanding Empathy in Problem-Solving Contexts for First-Year Engineering Students

This study takes place in an honors-based history/technology course focusing on World War II, co-taught by a professor of history and professor of engineering. Throughout the course, students completed projects in which they were asked to reverse engineer technical problems of WWII, but were sometimes asked to ""empathize,"" considering broader social and humanitarian concerns associated with their technical problems. Using discourse analysis to examine how students empathized when instructed, we found that they had more to write, were able to align themselves with stakeholders in the wars, better anticipated readers' needs, and wrote with more subjective, rather than objective voices.","John Carrell, Joshua Cruz, Erika Nunez",Proceedings of The American Educational Research Association (AERA) Annual Conference,4/23/2022,https://doi.org/10.3102/1886611,,,,Using Humanities-Driven STEM to Develop Empathetic Positions in Engineering Undergraduate Students: A Discourse Analysis.
24274,FT-286005-22,"Bartolina Sisa, warmi: Indigenous Women Outside the Script    Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui argues that words can cover up reality as much as represent it within a colonial setting. Cusicanqui herself, in writing about the 1781 La Paz rebellion led by Tupac Katari, does not mention his wife Bartolina Sisa or his sister, Gregoria Apaza, even though their contributions to the rebellion have been extensively documented (Valle de Siles, Thomson, Lewin). Both women fought alongside him and were hanged as a form of public spectacle, together, in what is today la Plaza Murillo, La Paz. In the official archival account of the events of 1781, we only know Sisa through the pen of others, and always via a translator, as she spoke Aymara. And yet, contemporary images, plays, films, songs, and stories proliferate about her. In Cusicanqui's La sociología de la imagen (Tinta Limón 2015), she proposes a methodology that puts the body at the center of practices of seeing in order to challenge Cartesian ocularcentrism, delinking visualization from its ties to language. Putting this methodology into practice in an attempt to encounter Sisa, I begin with an 1888 map of the La Paz rebellions by Florentino Olivares, which I argue is a harbinger of the continued rebellion of indigenous peoples, rather than a representation of their defeat. Second, I look at the way that indigenous peoples' ways of knowing through the landscape, as signaled in the play ""La lanza capitana"" (1962) by Raúl Botelho Gosálvez, casts doubt about the lettered class's ability to orient themselves amongst their surroundings, regardless of maps. And third, I turn to the song ""Bartolina Sisa, warmi"" made famous by Luzmila Carpio (1949 - ), arguably the most prolific indigenous singer of the Andes. The Quechua lyrics and sounds to ""Bartolina Sisa, warmi"" come from songs her grandmother and mother sang to her, and whose origin is impossible to trace.",Tara Daly,Thinking Andean Studies,3/25/2023,https://thinkingandeanstudies.com/,The website for the conference where I gave this presentation.,,,Bartolina Sisa Beyond the Script

In the book project, titled Back to the Future: The Archival Afterlives of Bartolina Sisa,  I work beyond the established archive to demonstrate that through 19th century paintings, 20th-century theatre, film and radio, and 21st-century film and performance art, Sisa and her cultural doubles come into view: in and beyond Bolivia. Each iteration of Sisa, and the indigenous and mestizo/a persons that animate her, speaks to the ways she defies reductionist classification and iconic fetishization as she moves across temporal and geographic scales. The difficulty of tracing Sisa from the archive, coupled with her persistent reproduction, challenges an approach to knowledge based on an original, the privileging of written text over oral traditions, and the notion that indigenous peoples are destined to disappear. That said, in project, I also want to avoid romantic generalizations that would see the reproduction of Sisa as uniformly ""decolonial"" or emancipatory.  Instead, my research program is based on two broad questions (ONE) How do Andean indigenous peoples navigate modernity in contradictory ways that can inform global indigenous studies?  (TWO) How do literature and the arts enable us to perceive these contradictions and learn from them?",Tara Daly,Kaleidescope Graduate Conference - UW Madison,3/5/23,https://kaleidoscope.spanport.wisc.edu/keynote-speakers/,Keynote speaker page for U of Wisconsin conference,,,Bartolina Sisa as Montage: Images of Indigenous Insurgency in the Andes
24290,FEL-282212-22,"In December 1946, the Northwest German Radio (NWDR) in Hamburg, Germany published the first issue of the radio magazine, Hör Zu (Listen Up!). Modeled on the popular pre-war radio program guides found throughout Europe and the United States (such as Radio Life), the periodical provided its readers with an up-to-date schedule of the weekly broadcasts of Germany's various regional radio stations, and employed images and short articles to incite interest in radio programs and personalities. Yet, for the first two years of its existence, it also included new features, aimed to offer a ""behind the scenes"" glimpse into the radio production process, demystifying the ""miracle wireless"" and turning it into a space for the open exchange of ideas. In so doing, the publication of Hör Zu marked a notable turning point in the history of the radio in Germany. Under National Socialism, the radio had served as a primary instrument of propaganda dissemination and its ideal listener was imagined to be the passive receptor of the party's message. Hör Zu's new vision for the radio, in contrast, was emphasized in the request for listener feedback found in the mission statement on the first issue's opening pages: ""Don't be afraid of a public response,"" the editors claimed, ""We no longer live under the whip of a dictator!"" In the eyes of its creators, Axel Eggebrecht and Peter Zahn, Hör Zu marked the dawn of a new age of radio, in which the audience would be transformed into actively engaged and critical listeners.",Caroline Kita,"A Century of Broadcasting: Preservation and Renewal.

Its primary case study is the collaboration between German-Jewish writer Wolfgang Hildesheimer and composer Hans Werner Henze, Das Ende einer Welt, adapted from Hildesheimer's short story in Lieblosen Legenden (1952), and broadcast on the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk in December 1953. This paper explores how the skewed perceptions of time and space that Hildesheimer associated with his own experience of exile are ""sounded"" in the text through his musical language and references, and then capitalized upon by Henze's musical score and its use of quotation and collage. Both author and composer, I claim, exploit the unique expressive properties of the radio to create a sense of acoustic compression or claustrophobia, and temporal stasis. In its conclusion, this paper reflects on how genres such as the Hörspiel and Funkoper offered new opportunities for individual and collective working through the past in postwar German culture.",Caroline Kita,"German Studies Association Conference, Houston, Texas",9/16/22,,,,,Music at the End of a World: Sounding Exile in the Postwar Funkoper

While this is a crucial insight, it cannot suffice as a comprehensive account of what the Talmud is as a compilation. For example, scholars have largely left unexplored the synchronic shape of the Bavli as a whole, which comprises a mix of materials that are devoted to the interpretation of the Mishnah and related discussions, and ""digressive"" sources which are included within the fabric of the text.

The roundtable discussion will feature directors of four NEH-supported projects.  The Landmarks of American History and Culture program funds professional development workshops that help teachers understand the importance of place. These workshops bring together scholars, public historians, and other partners to engage K-12 educators in the study of sites of historic and cultural significance across the United States. Understanding place, of course, requires understanding borders, migration, and other kinds of movement.  The panel will include directors from two recent Landmarks programs: one on the forced movement of Japanese Americans to incarceration camps during WWII and the other on the multi-ethnic and multi-generational migration of people to the San Joaquin Valley.  The agency's Humanities Connections program, on the other hand, helps teachers and students at college and universities cross intellectual and institutional boundaries between humanities and non-humanities disciplines. These awards support partnerships between humanities faculty and their counterparts in the social and natural sciences and in pre-service or professional programs. They help faculty create interdisciplinary majors, minors, pathways, certificates, and other undergraduate programs incorporating experiential learning.

We decided to make this piece of locative sound art— designed primarily for people who are Deafblind, blind, or who have low-vision—at the site of Andy Goldsworthy's four outdoor public art installations within the Presidio in San Francisco. During our design process, we encountered many complexities demanding design attention and forcing difficult artistic choices, including about approaches to the vocal performance, the dualistic proximity of listeners to the artwork (they were either on site or off), and to the quirks of the physical environment, including about how to handle an alleged arson of one of the artworks that happened mid-development and closed the area to visitors. As these complications were revealed, we rejected reductionism and the impulse to solely focus on the content, the medium, or the mobilities. We stuck to the philosophy that all were co-equally important and approached the design development accordingly. We then gathered feedback about this audio description from representative audience members, which included on-site tests with five individuals, facilitated by a research team member. We used a think-aloud protocol, during which participants talked about their responses to the audio files in the moment. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with the individuals after each visit. In addition, we built an online review system as a part of the support software that allowed other representative audience members to listen to the prototype and answer either open-ended or Likert-like questions remotely.

24414,PR-276897-21,"The Digital Video Commander project seeks to reframe the entire paradigm of preservation when applied to digital videotapes rather than adopt upon the practices used for analog videotape. Capturing the contents of a digital videotape does not need to be as restrained as attempting to record an ideal, singular presentation of a videotape, but there is a potential that such effort could mimic the more accurate data transfers of hard drives or sectored optical discs where the quality of the data transferred could be verified piece-by-piece and retried as needed to create a more accurate result.   During the NEH R&amp;D funded project, DV Rescue, MIPoPS has found that digitization software does not need to solely work as a diligent scribe that documents the contents recorded on legacy videotapes, but that such software can take control of the hardware, guide the user, automate actions, and orchestrate the entire reformatting event. Such an approach requires skilled development, but the results place this essential preservation practice within reach for more collecting institutions who would benefit from it while producing more accurate representations of digital videotape contents than is currently feasible with more traditional workflows. Additionally, whereas expert calibration of analog signals is essential for presenting data loss while digitizing analog videotapes, the opposite is somewhat true for digital videotapes, where signal manipulation of the digital videotape decoding adds generational loss rather than accuracy. We see that the characteristics of digital videotape provide an opportunity for automation, ease, and increased accuracy within the preservation of digital videotapes and the potential to promote project results in a way that reduces barriers for institutions seeking to establish in-house audiovisual preservation services.

Due to the lack of resources required to train and evaluate models, most modern language technologies are either nonexistent or unreliable to process endangered, local, and non-standardized languages.

However, such OCR output is typically noisy, and most word alignment models are not built to work under such noisy conditions. In this work, we study the existing word-level alignment models under noisy settings and aim to make them more robust to noisy data.

Our results demonstrate the potential benefits that OCR tools can have on downstream language documentation and revitalization efforts.","Shruti Rijhwani, Daisy Rosenblum, Michayla King, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Graham Neubig",Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on the Use of Computational Methods in the Study of Endangered Languages (ComputEL-6),1/3/2023,https://aclanthology.org/2023.computel-1.4/,ACL Anthology Link,,,User-Centric Evaluation of OCR Systems for Kwak’wala

The 30,000 hits on the STiCH website demonstrate the appetite for guidance in effective sustainable choices. Overall, we have learned the benefit in providing specific direction towards sustainable practices that professionals can grasp and initiate. The STiCH Carbon Calculator look-up tool and Library of Case Studies provide data that guides and empowers professionals as they continue to explore and implement new, lower impact methods. In this talk we will reference the findings of the Case Studies and the guidance provided by the Carbon Calculator to illustrate our overall lessons learned.  Through our project we have learned the importance in collaboration between fields to support sustainable practices. We will discuss lessons learned in creating effective tools for sustainable practices specific to cultural heritage preservation, and how the valuable, clear link between LCA methods and preservation practices provides a route for effective collaboration. Collaboration between these two specialties has opened the central question: ""at what cost are we preserving our cultural heritage?"" As conservators, we know that preserving our cultural heritage for future generations is sustainable at its core, and as we explore sustainable goals we emphasize that ""green"" practices are not about stopping work. Instead, informed choices and sustainable thinking improves professional methods, requires creative approaches, and reduces environmental impacts. Creative thinking is the core of conservation practices and integral to our work.  As useful as LCA is, it by no means provides an easy one-stop answer. Sustainability is a multi-pronged goal and conservators will achieve this goal and use their discoveries as they work to not only preserve our heritage but our planet.","Sarah Nunberg, Matthew Eckelman",American Institute for Conservation's 51st Annual Meeting,5/19/2023,https://aic51stannualmeeting2023.sched.com/event/1EW9e/concurrent-general-session-reduce-reuse-recycle-sustainability-tools-in-cultural-heritage-lessons-learned-for-forward-thinking,,,,Sustainability Tools in Cultural Heritage: Lessons Learned for Forward Thinking
13421,FA-251827-17,"The ""Unruly Inmates"" of Culion  Beginning in 1906, American colonial officials ordered the mandatory confinement of leprosy patients to the island of Culion. This paper explores female patient activism in Culion during the early twentieth century. It focuses on patients' reaction to restrictions on marriage and cohabitation, first implemented in 1907. These regulations generated several protests, including the 1932 protest dubbed ""The Manchuria."" There is a paucity of sources on patients' responses written by the patients themselves, but there are government reports, accounts of colonial officials, and accounts by the nuns and priests who lived in Culion. Government reports tended to characterize the male patients as the leaders. Accounts of nuns and priests illuminate their paternalistic view of female patients as wards who needed to be protected from male patients. Yet, a close reading of accounts of health officials and admission records reveal the presence of ""unruly"" women and the consequences of their participation in these ""disturbances.""   This paper seeks to advance our understanding of Filipino leprosy patients' engagement with American colonial authorities. This is an understudied theme in the existing literature on empire and public health policy and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. The existing literature on leprosy patients' resistance tends to focus on men. In this paper, I argue that some female leprosy patients asserted their sense of self and in so doing, rejected the notion of women as weak, mere followers of male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.",Febe Pamonag,American Association for the History of Medicine Annual Meeting,5/12/2018,http://http://histmed.org/documents/AAHM2018 program.pdf? ga=2.95453276.1729071773.1526414237-25395185.1453958309,American Association for the History of Medicine 2018 Conference program,,,"The ""Unruly Inmates"" of Culion"

13451,FT-255030-17,"References to slavery in the epistles of the apostle Paul play a climactic role in the oeuvre of influential political philosopher Giorgio Agamben. In order to challenge Agamben's account of what he terms ""anthropogenesis""—the becoming human of the human being—I offer an alternative reading of selected passages in Paul.  The nine volumes of Agamben's Homo Sacer project begin with a distinction Agamben attributes to Aristotle, a distinction between mere biological life (zoe) and politically conditioned life (bios). The passage in the Politics giving rise to this distinction continues with a discussion of natural slavery. It is thus strange that in the first eight Homo Sacer volumes Agamben does not consider the figure of the slave to exemplify what he terms ""bare life,"" precarious life supposedly shorn of bios. Instead, he names the banned man, the obscure homo sacer of Roman law. Against Agamben's nomination of the banned man as epitome of bare life, I propose instead a banned woman--Paul's Hagar. By ""Paul's Hagar,"" I mean both the Hagar Paul reads in the pages of the Septuagint and the Hagar he writes in his allegory in Galatians (4:21-5:1). Readings of Hagar by feminist and womanist scholars both anticipate Agamben's account of bare life and expose the reductive limits of that account.  My paper primarily focuses on Hagar and bare life. As a coda, I conclude with a brief philological critique of The Use of Bodies, the final Homo Sacer installment. Fixating on Aristotle's definition of slavery in terms of ""use of the body,"" Agamben at last considers implications of slavery for conceptions of the human. The useful Onesimus offers a counterweight to Agamben's claim that for Paul the figure of the slave represents a messianic hope for becoming human (cf. 1 Corinthians 7:21).",Jennifer A.

13525,FA-251961-17,"In 1909, the U.S Supreme Court, echoing the typical reasoning of earlier U.S. and British legal rulings regarding the distribution of media goods, held that a copyright holder's distribution rights for any single copy of a media good are exhausted upon the first sale of that copy. Later codified as ""The First Sale Doctrine,"" this legal principle severely limited the ability of publishers and other content owners to control how the media goods they sold in the United States were priced, distributed, and consumed.   This paper argues that the First Sale Doctrine has been the legal bedrock for two key features of twentieth-century media distribution in the U.S.: the retail store and what is usually called the secondary (ie. used) market. In enabling these institutions, the Doctrine has provided consumers broader and cheaper access to media goods while also fostering new forms of entrepreneurial activity and participatory culture. Drawing from legal cases, congressional hearings, and trade articles, this paper also demonstrates and accounts for the Doctrine's surprising resilience throughout the twentieth century, during which time it had been the object of numerous attempts by American media companies to undermine or dismantle it. The paper concludes with an analysis of the Doctrine's continued meaning and validity during the twenty-first century, particularly with respect to new digital distribution systems and restrictive Terms of Service licenses.

13536,FT-255079-17,"Over the past fifteen years, there has been an explosion of immigration policy-making at the state level, with some states taking an anti-immigrant stance while others support immigrant integration.  What explains this variation?  In this project, we focus on Arizona and New Mexico, which provide ideal comparative cases for study because of their many similarities.  Located in the southwest desert region of the United States, they share a common geographical history.  They were, to a large extent, part of the same jurisdictional territory in the mid-1800s, and they attained statehood the same year (1912).  Both states border Mexico, as well as each other.  Yet New Mexico and Arizona have taken widely divergent paths in the realm of immigration enforcement and immigrant integration over the past decade.  Their differences reflect the patchwork of approaches that has developed across the country, with these states representing the far ends of the spectrum:  a harsh, anti-immigrant enforcement-oriented model in Arizona, and a pro-immigrant incorporation model in New Mexico.  We hypothesize that these divergent approaches have roots deeply anchored in the racial political economies of these states, stretching from the territorial period (mid-1800s to 1910) to statehood (1912), and into the present.  In this paper, we focus specifically on the Chicano Movement (1962-1975), which we argue is a critical juncture for the development of contemporary immigration politics in both states.  Despite the Chicano Movement's shared inspirations and aspirations across the Southwest, each state's racial and political history shaped the Movement in important and specific ways, leading to widely divergent outcomes.  Our analysis suggests that every political movement is local, indelibly shaped by its socio-political environment, and that local conditions shape and constrain social movements in important ways.","Monica Varsanyi, Doris Marie Provine",Social Science History Association,11/8/2018,,,,,Understanding contemporary immigration politics in New Mexico and Arizona:  The Chicano Movement (1962-1975) as critical juncture

It is argued that stem vowels are specified underlyingly as having either one or two moras (as part of the full ~ reduced vowel contrast, inherited from Proto-Dene), while prefix vowels have zero moras--that is, they do not contrast in length. This hypothesis is called ""Systematic Underspecification"". When combined with level ordering, this hypothesis explains nearly all of the observed vowel length alternations in prefixes. Specifically, long vowels in prefixes take at least two cycles to derive: a vowel acquires a mora on the first cycle, and then a consequent subsequently deletes on a later cycle, leaving behind a long vowel. On the other hand, if a vowel coalesces with another vowel immediately on the same cycle at which it is added, a short vowel will result, since the new vowel had zero moras in the input, and thus does not add any new vowel length.",Alessandro Jaker,,01/06/2018,,,,,Systematic Underspecification and Derived Environment Effects in Tetsot'ine (Yellowknife)

13584,FA-57922-14,"Guillaume Du Fay's Nuper rosarum flores has been ground zero for symbolic interpretation in musicology ever since Charles Warren suggested that the structure of the motet reflects the architectural proportions of the cathedral of Florence. More recent analyses have continued to begin from the premise that the motet's form has extramusical significance—in particular, that mensural and architectural proportions can be directly analogized. And of course the very text of the motet makes clear that Du Fay wrote this music in conjunction with the 1436 dedication of Santa Maria del Fiore, possibly even for performance as part of the elaborate consecration rite. These tantalizing connections have caused scholars to canonize this motet, which has become a mainstay of music history textbooks. Indeed the extent and specificity of the extramusical associations Nuper rosarum flores enjoys—an occasion, place, patron, even an unquestioned attribution—is rare in the fifteenth century. This in itself makes the piece seem special.  This wealth of information makes it hard to read Nuper rosarum flores in any context other than the consecration ceremony. Nevertheless, it is just one of many motets Du Fay composed for specific occasions. In this paper I return to first principles, reading Nuper rosarum flores against the norms of genre and notation and against the grain of the work's modern historiography. I suggest that it is not all that special—or, at least, that it is no more special than Du Fay's other ceremonial motets. This, in turn, leads me to ask what Nuper rosarum flores and pieces like it can tell us about text, form, and notation, and about how fifteenth-century music constructs meaning.",Emily Zazulia,"American Musicological Society, Annual Meeting, Rochester, NY",11/09/2017,,,,,"Out of Proportion: Nuper rosarum flores, Cathedralism, and the Danger of False Exceptionalism"

13615,FA-57922-14,"Guillaume Du Fay's Nuper rosarum flores has been ground zero for symbolic interpretation in musicology ever since Charles Warren suggested that the structure of the motet reflects the architectural proportions of the cathedral of Florence. More recent analyses have continued to begin from the premise that the motet's form has extramusical significance—in particular, that mensural and architectural proportions can be directly analogized. And of course the very text of the motet makes clear that Du Fay wrote this music in conjunction with the 1436 dedication of Santa Maria del Fiore, possibly even for performance as part of the elaborate consecration rite. These tantalizing connections have caused scholars to canonize the motet, which has become a mainstay of music-history textbooks. Indeed the extent and specificity of the extramusical associations Nuper rosarum flores enjoys—an occasion, place, patron, even an unquestioned attribution—is rare in the fifteenth-century. This itself makes the piece seem special.   With this wealth of information it can be hard to see Nuper rosarum flores in any context except the consecration ceremony, but it remains just one of many motets Du Fay wrote for specific occasions. In this paper I return to first principles, reading Nuper rosarum flores against the norms of genre and notation and against the grain of the work's modern historiography, concluding that it isn't all that special—or at least no more special than Du Fay's other ceremonial motets. This, in turn, leads me to ask what Nuper rosarum flores and works like it can tell us about text, form, and notation, and about how fifteenth-century music constructs meaning.",Emily Zazulia,Annual Meeting of the American Musicological Society,11/8/2017,,,,,"Out of Proportion: Nuper rosarum flores, Cathedralism, and the Danger of False Exceptionalism"

The resolutions fit with the non-canonic voices, but don't clearly derive from the canonic tenor. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, I propose a reading of the canonic notation that is unorthodox but theoretically grounded. In a period when augmentation was new and subject to different interpretations, it is no surprise that composers found diverse solutions. Viewing this mass's notation as still coalescing invites us to reflect on the nature of augmentation and, by extension, the relationship between notation and musical ideas.",Emily Zazulia,"Annual Medieval and Renaissance Music Conference, Brussels",7/8/2015,,,,,Resolving Problems in the Missa Gross Senen

This period, during which independence was an essential concern in Africa and the Caribbean as well as in Quebec, nurtured solidarities defined by leftist politics and serious considerations of interregional, interracial, and interclass difference. The ""tongue ties"" of the paper's title has a double meaning: while francophone anticolonial intellectuals were ""tied"" linguistically through their use of the French tongue, their connection was also constricted (tied) by the inherent qualities of a language itself shaped by varied francophone histories and cultures. Language was fashioned by and simultaneously fashioned these solidarities. Specifically, my paper will lay the groundwork for an examination of the ways texts worked with and through language in this period, arguing that the linguistic tropes that authors used to express unity in difference reveal both gaps and unexpected connections in the francophone political imaginary. The analytical abecedary of these tropes constitutes a ""poetics of solidarity"" that defines a foundational moment in French-language world literature.",Julie-Françoise Tolliver,American Comparative Literature Association Colloquium,04/01/2018,https://www.acla.org/,This is the URL for the association that hosted the conference.,,,Tongue Ties: A Poetics of Solidarity in Independence Francophone Literature

Some predict that this will eventually lead to a post-work heaven of leisure, while others predict a hellish state of poverty and boredom.  It's thus worth thinking through a few questions: 1.) in the coming few decades, what sorts of jobs might be destroyed by machine learning, and what sorts might endure, and might be created?  2.) to remain employed, how might we prepare for this?  and 3.) how will these shifts affect how we find meaning in our work?",Jon K.

13696,AC-50213-14,"As part of two government grant projects, surveys of California world history teachers in 2002 and 2015 found that teachers skip the mandatory units on Islam.  As an undergraduate in 1995 it was obvious to me that Islam is important in the world and in the U.S., while it remains a low priority in our education system.  Scholars in the AAR such as Fred Denny, Michael Sells, and John Esposito have published excellent introductory texts that do not filter down to the training of history teachers.  There is a demonstrated need as evidenced by Pew Forum findings that prejudice against Islam is steady or increasing and the rate of hate crimes has not dropped back to pre-9-11 levels.   Since 2009 faculty in the U.S. are encountering students with lower real wages and rising expenses alongside cultural obstacles of underprepared students.  In addition, scholars of Islam find themselves working in an increasingly politicized environment.  There is ideological pressure to join neo-imperial or post-colonial camps or to promote neoliberal or religious nationalist worldviews.   This chapter presents the three leading efforts in the Americas to move beyond these binaries.  Leaders in Montreal, Quebec, Bogota, Colombia, and Boston, Massachusetts (Programme Éthique et culture religieuse, Programa de Competencias Ciudadanas, and Harvard Religious Literacy Project, respectively) have identified that in the 21st century religious literacy is an essential part of citizenship education.  One no longer needs to fly to Ankara, Turkey, like Annemarie Schimmel in 1954, to learn about Muslim cultures.  Muslims are already our neighbors, co-workers, and classmates.

13712,FA-251827-17,"Public health was crucial to the success of the American pacification campaign and the ""civilizing process"" in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. In 1905, American colonial officials established a leper colony in Culion, southwest of Manila. To safeguard public health, officials deemed it necessary to forcibly remove ""lepers"" from their homes; however, in 1907, citing limited resources and the difficulty of pregnancy for women with leprosy, they banned cohabitation and marriage within Culion. Colonial officials had downplayed Filipino leprosy patients' opposition to the segregation order. But how did female patients respond to the segregation policy? How did they engage with authorities over such issues as the ban on cohabitation and marriage?  This paper advances our understanding of the engagement between Filipino women leprosy patients and colonial officials. This is an understudied theme in literature on empire, medicine, and public health, and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Very few studies of Culion address patients' – mostly men – oppositional views and practices. I argue that female patients, individually and collectively, asserted their sense of self and in so doing, rejected the notion of women as weak, mere followers of the male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.",Febe Pamonag,nternational Federation for Research in Women's History (IFRWH),8/10/2018,http://www.ifrwh.com,International Federation for Research in Women's History (IFRWH) 2018 Conference website,,,"The ""Unruly Women"" of Culion"
13721,HB-50448-14,"Spanish poet Gerardo Diego became reknown during his lifetime for his ""classic"" style, notably the incomparable sonnet ""El ciprés de Silos,"" which generations of schoolchildren in Spain learned to recite from memory. Such classic poetry, led in great part to Diego's induction into the Real Academic Española as well as his receiving the Premio Cervantes in 1979. Before the Spanish Civil War, however, and among students of his work, Diego has also been known as a key figure in the Spanish avant-garde in relation to poetry; his volumes Imagen (1922) and Manual de espumas (1924) set the pace for the poetic vanguard in 1920s Spain, especially the Ultraísmo and Creacionismo movements.  Given both Diego's level of recognition and his achievement as poet, it remains surprising that another crucial aspect of his work has remained largely unexplored: the engagement with popular poetry and music. Moreover, Diego's fascination with popular and traditional poetry from the inception of his career augurs the stylization of popular and traditional forms—in the classic or avant-garde mode—which would become characteristic not only of his work, but also that of such Generation of 1927 figures as Rafael Alberti and Federico García Lorca. This paper centers on Diego's adoption of the at once popular and traditional romance form, from the time of his first poetry volume, El romancero de la novia (pub. 1920), to the various transformations of the romance that he incorporated into many of his subsequent volumes. It also explores the unique characteristics of Diego's romances in contrast with salient Generation of 1927 texts like Lorca's Romancero gitano (1928). For, as I argue, the adaptation of popular and traditional forms played a significant part in twentieth-century Spanish poetry, as well as a special role in the development of the Spanish avant-garde and its peculiar identity.",Renée M.

13722,HB-50448-14,"When we think of the Spanish poet Gerardo Diego (1896-1987), what frequently comes to mind is the ""classic"" sonnet ""El ciprés de Silos"" or, perhaps, such avant-garde volumes as Imagen (1922) and Manual de espumas (1924). It may then come as a surprise that there existed another side to Diego—one which privileged and celebrated popular poetry and music. Unlike his fellow members of the Generation of 1927 Federico García Lorca and Rafael Alberti, Diego's interest in the popular has stayed largely unrecognized. Yet Diego was not only a proud son of his city of birth, Santander, but also, he remained a life-long student of Cantabrian culture and an accomplished concert-level pianist who perfectly understood the region´s musico-poetic production.   From his first poetry volume, Romancero la novia. Iniciales (1917; pub. 1920), to such mature works as Alondra de verdad (1941), Canciones a Violante (1959), Mi Santander, mi cuna, mi palabra (1961), and Sonetos a Violante (1962), Diego has given voice to the music and poetry of Cantabria. At the same time, Diego´s style should not be considered ""folkloric""; rather, he articulates Cantabrian culture by mixing avant-garde and popular form. This paper will focus on how Cantabria's peculiar musico-poetic culture finds expression in Mi Santander, mi cuna, mi palabra, and the way in which Diego transforms and stylizes such music and poetry so that it acquires an abstract and markedly vanguard form, thus combining the popular and avant-garde in an idiosyncratic fashion.",Renée M.

But how does stationary architecture—and the complex messages it conveys—translate into a collective memory shared across space? I investigate how buildings could project desired images of cities and regions, establishing a collective memory of those sites—for example, of Puteoli as a city uniquely favored by Rome's emperors. I demonstrate how souvenir representations of architecture enabled this projected image to become collective memory not only locally but also around the empire. Finally, I argue that souvenirs of structures illuminate Roman notions of architecture and urban space. My approach draws on close visual and archaeological analysis and on neuro-cognitive studies of how visual imagery shapes memory. I also consider the cognitive science of how conversation and social interactions—precisely what the Roman souvenirs were designed to prompt—generate shared memories.

13781,FA-251491-17,"Ancient Romans had a rich if underappreciated tradition of souvenirs associated with religious experience. This paper examines two categories of religious souvenirs that transcended the boundaries of sanctuaries. The first category I term prospective souvenirs: objects commissioned for use before a visit to a sanctuary and then deposited there as votives. The second I call retrospective souvenirs: mementoes purchased during a visit to a sanctuary and then brought home for display. Both prospective and retrospective religious souvenirs generated narratives of religious experience that transcended the temporal limitations of visits to sanctuaries and that became integrated into daily life, on roads or in cities. Cognitive research about prospective memory, collaborative remembering, and semantic memory illuminates the agency of souvenirs to shape collective memories and knowledge of religious sites and rituals. Religious souvenirs are, therefore, critical to understanding how religious experience and sites were materialized, remembered, and conceptualized in cities and on roads far removed from classical sanctuaries.",Maggie L.

13794,RQ-230528-15,"""Defending Language Security: Letters from the Dakota, 1862-1865"" will provide a description of the English translation of first-person narratives of those Dakota people writing in their own language during the mid-nineteenth century. The time period selected for this presentation encompasses the years of most drastic change for Dakota people—treaty negotiations, land loss, war, imprisonment, and exile. The selected letters provide insights into the lives of prominent and ordinary Dakota people held in prison in Minnesota and Iowa after the war with the United States in 1862, their opinions about their relationships with the federal government, and their attempts to negotiate the rapid changes brought on by Christianity, war, and exile.  A Dakota perspective—observations of the world written in their own words in their own language—will challenge accepted representations of their issues and concerns as written by missionaries and historians.

13856,FA-251630-17,"In traditional Tunisian healing practices, one of the most common diagnoses is affliction by water spirits (ba?riyya). A wide variety of ritual healing musics feature songs dedicated to these water spirits, as well as the saints, such as Sidi Bu Sa‘id el-Baji, who are believed to control them. The praise song (nuba) for Sidi Bu Sa‘id called ra'is el-ab?ar (captain of the seas) is found in numerous healing and devotional musics, providing a shared reference for musics associated with a diversity of communities, including healing traditions of women (such as the mannubiyya), the Jewish community (rebaybiyya), and even drinking parties of laborers (mizwid). In this paper, I examine this song in relation to the cultural ""work"" of the silsila (""chain""), a flexible musical form that provides a sonic inventory of the saints of the local devotional landscape. In doing so, I explore the Jewish-Muslim convergences that defined the rebaybiyya tradition, the trans-Mediterranean (Tunis-Paris) traffic in musicians that nurtured it, and the faint traces of those collaborations and movements that remain in the Tunisian devotional musical landscape.",Richard Jankowsky,"Music and Sound at the Mediterranean Crossroads, International Council for Traditional Music, Essaouira, Morocco",06/20/2018,,,,,Sonic Traces of Trans-Mediterranean Itineraries of Jewish Musical Healing
13857,FA-251630-17,"Can musical form reflect, or even encourage, particular ethical stances? This paper approaches this question through a consideration of the devotional and healing rituals held at the shrines of Sayyda Mannubiyya in Tunisia, which have been high-profile targets of militant Islamist vandalism and threats in recent years. The women's trance healing ritual is based on a musical form called the silsila (lit. ""chain""), a flexible succession of songs dedicated to different saints in the local devotional landscape. The silsila references the ""home"" traditions of these different saints, including those of Sufi orders that may have competing claims about the appropriateness of music and trance, while also bringing these disparate traditions into the distinctive soundworld of the Mannubiyya. Sayyda Mannubiyya is also unique in the local context as the only female saint to have inspired a men's devotional ritual. Male members of the Shadhuliyya Sufi order perform their liturgy immediately following the women's trance ceremony. The men's liturgy revolves around the dhikr (chanted repetitions of religious formulas), which has ritual objectives, aesthetics, and priorities that, at first glance, seem to stand in opposition to those of the women. Yet ethnographic and musical analysis reveals fissures that complicate binaries of male/female or dhikr/silsila to show how they each constitute a devotional niche within a shared ecology of saint-based ritual practices and espouse distinct yet complementary ethical work at the individual and community levels.",Richard Jankowsky,"Music and Monotheism Symposium, New England Conservatory of Music",11/09/2017,,,,,Ethics and Musical Form in Tunisian Islam: The Silsila of Sayyda Mannubiyya

They share a musical form called the silsila (chain), which is flexible and encourages borrowing. But each one also reveals the distinguishing characteristics of each ritual community: the women's silsila highlights women saints and the role of motherhood; the black Tunisian silsila highlights its history of trans-Saharan movements of people, spirits, and musical aesthetics; the Jewish silsila avoids mention of the Prophet but connects to ritually adjacent practices.

As with many cultures that enjoy such designs, all 7 strip symmetry groups appear in the collection of huipils we investigated, but some strip patterns were substantially rarer than others. There appear to be weaving reasons for some of the difference in frequencies. One strip pattern, pmm2, essentially only appears on the shoulder bands of these tunics, and may be related to a desire for a 3-dimensional ""front-to-back"" symmetry imposed upon the symmetries that appear in a more ""standard"" Oaxaca design. A surprisingly large number of variations of strip symmetries appear in these huipil, including 3-color and 4-color symmetry; combinations of adjacent strips with varying symmetries; and deliberate symmetry breaking. One huipil gives the impression of a weaver consciously playing with, or experimenting with, glide reflections.

13892,RA-50142-14,"This paper looks at a 1950s conflict between market researchers Alfred Politz and Ernest Dichter as more than a methodological squabble in the behavioral sciences: it was a paradigmatic conflict over the possibility of subjective choice as a fundamental principle of democracy.  Dichter professed to use the psychoanalytic method to expose the ""true"" basis of consumers' motivations, but his fellow market researchers distrusted the scientific rigor of his method, and contemporary writers attacked his brand motivational research as a threat to the autonomy of American consumers who had become vulnerable to manipulation by a mysterious group of ""depth probers.""  For Politz, what people believed on a conscious level, or even what they desired on an unconscious level, was not getting to the truth in market research; for him, what was true was how consumers would behave in a marketplace situation.  The truth could be arrived at through the scientific design of the survey, calibrated to judge the likelihood of behaviors and actions, not the depth of attitudes.  Although it occurred within the provincial world of consumer market research, this conflict had profound implications for the concept of the individual as an autonomous agent in a commercial-democratic society.",Joe Malherek,41st Annual Economic and Business History Society Conference,05/26/2017,,http://www.ebhsoc.org/conference/public/conferences/2/schedConfs/6/program-en US.pdf,,,Nose-Counters versus Depth-Probers: European Émigrés and the Contentious Science of Market Research in Postwar America

Using a critical black feminist lens, I consider how these popular works, both part of the emergent renaissance in African American television, grapple with the state of life-or-death emergency that is black American life in our immediate present moment.

13969,FA-252136-17,"Theater practitioners and performance studies scholars have historically shared the project of putting aspects of culture on display for reflexive critique. In this paper, I consider the problem of translation of theatrical works for international consumption. I ask how the Algerian play ""Apples,"" written by Abdelkader Alloula in 1993, was translated for performance in the US in 2016 by the Algerian troupe Istijmam. While the script posed issues in linguistic translation, the genre conventions and cultural dimensions proved more challenging. The play sets Algerian storytelling practices in relation to Brechtian techniques of epic theater, both of which forego linear development and feature actors moving among a range of roles. Such techniques, largely executed through the body, are intended to create distance between text, actors, and spectators that allow for cultural critique – a process Brecht called distantiation or alienation.  How did this Algero-Brechtian project resonate with audiences in the United States?  How was the apple, a luxury import in Algeria that symbolized the country's failed opening to neoliberal democracy, made intelligible in the US, where apples are available in every corner market? How did the embodied techniques of distantiation used by the actors serve both to translate and to critically stand apart from the theatrical work? By examining the US performances of Apples, I explore new intersections between ethnography and theater, asking whether and how theatrical critique translates when it travels.

13975,RZ-249862-16,"Most accounts of the Columbian voyages and the Age of Encounters describe Europeans' initial confusion of America with Asia: a confusion that quickly gave way to the realization that America was a New World. According to this way of thinking, such confusion—for instance, the idea that Jamaica might be Java, or that Tenochtitlan might be Quinsay—has been seen as a momentary, if not quaint, misunderstanding. A wide variety of evidence however demonstrates that learned Europeans continued to represent the Americas as Asia up to and beyond 1600. Mercator, for instance, labeled the central valley of Mexico as ""India"" in his influential 1569 atlas, and the French explorer Jean Nicolet believed that when he and his fellow mariners crossed Lake Michigan in 1634, they would be greeted by the Great Khan of China on the other side. This paper will focus in particular on a 1558 world map by Casper Vopel, a map that depicted Asia and America as the same continent, and Cathay and Mexico as the same province. Ideas about ""Amerasia"" so regularly inhabited the minds of early modern Europeans; this paper will use Vopel's map to explore how Amerasia functioned, culturally and intellectually and the claims it made; namely, how it served the needs of European imperialism, as well as how it it offered explanations about the universal and shared origins of humanity.",ELizabeth Horodowich,Association of Asian Studies Conference,3/25/2018,,,,,"The European ""Discovery"" of Amerasia: Casper Vopel's World Map"

The New World objects collected by, say, the Habsburgs or the Medici, are studied by Americanists, whereas the Asian objects in those collections are studied by specialists in those fields. Yet in the collections the objects mingled, and so did their provenances. New World objects were often called ""indiane"" or ""dell'India;"" almost never were they called American. Artifacts from New Spain were regularly studied in the context of knowledge about Egypt and Asia. As late as 1665, one Mesoamerican manuscript, the Cospi Codex, was inscribed ""Libro della China"" (and not long thereafter was corrected to ""Libro del Messico,"" signaling, perhaps, the advent of a new era of designation). Rather than see these incidents as mistakes or confusions to be cleared up, this paper attempts to inhabit the Amerasian extension imagined by Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as a coherent if flexible system.

14028,FT-260316-18,"In Ambient Rhetoric, Thomas Rickert offers a New Materialist approach to rhetoric and theorizes that rhetorical networks distribute agency between material and human actors. Rickert's work not only gives material objects a new importance in rhetorical situations, but it also challenges the subject/object divide in traditional rhetoric. Although New Materialist approaches to rhetoric are a relatively new development in Western thought (Rickert's text was published in 2013), the underlying principles have been operating in Byzantine Christian religious visual rhetoric for well over a thousand years. This presentation argues that the rhetorics of display that developed around Byzantine religious icons both challenge and reinforce traditional Western subject/object binaries and complicate our understand of ambient rhetoric.  When displayed in cathedrals, Byzantine icons exemplify ambient rhetoric by inviting viewers into an interactive space that breaks down the both subject/object and material/spiritual barriers. I use Sicily's twelfth-century Monreale Cathedral as a case study that demonstrates how icons surround the faithful with a great cloud of witnesses – a supernatural network – that they could experience with all five senses. This liminal space allows for a destabilizing reversal of the subject/object divide: icon viewers become a part of the images and are themselves transformed into religious subjects. As Kaufmann points out, however, contemporary experiences of religious sites are in no way equivalent to Byzantine experiences. Today, Monreale Cathedral is as much a tourist destination as a church. This presentation additionally considers how the frameworks of capitalism and tourism complicate both subject/object binaries and the notion of ambient rhetoric.",Amy Anderson,Rhetoric and Religion in the Twenty-First Century,10/6/2018,,,,,The Ambient Rhetoric of Byzantine Iconography:  What Byzantine Icons Can Teach Us About New Materialism

Specifically, the widely popular poet, activist, and educator Lydia Howard Huntley Sigourney credited Zinzendorf for her pacifist convictions and stance against Indian removal. The preface to her eponymous poem ""Zinzendorff"" reveals a ""personal intercourse with that sect of Christians"" (5). This essay thus hopes to reveal, via Sigourney's characterization of Zinzendorf, that German Pietism enjoyed a remarkable purchase among Anglo-phone Americans long after German religious immigrants first sought to establish the precepts of radical German Protestantism throughout the North American colonies. Although both the Moravians and Sigourney have enjoyed a modicum of interest in late 20th and early 21st century scholarship, their stories still appear as outliers in a literary and cultural history and consciousness dominated by the Edwards-to-Emerson narrative.",Patrick M.

14054,FA-252471-17,"Using Randall Kenan's 1989 novel A Visitation of Spirits as a fulcrum, ""Quaring Childhood"" aims to bring several fields that have developed substantially in the past two decades—childhood studies, critical race studies, queer theory, and new southern studies—into dialogue. In her influential 2009 study, The Queer Child, Kathryn Bond Stockton asserts that all children are ""thoroughly, shockingly queer,"" a claim, as Michael Bibler has recently outlined (""Queer/Quare""), with many parallels in critical evaluations of the U.S. South. Responding to what he sees as a willful blindness toward race, class and ethnicity in queer theory, E. Patrick Johnson borrowed from the southern vernacular to advocate for a ""quare studies"" that accounts for tangible, material bodies as they are situated in local (regional, racialized, religious) practices of everyday life. ""Quaring Childhood,"" puts the precepts of Johnson's ""quare"" in conversation with Stockton's theory of the ""publicly impossible"" ""ghostly gay child"" as a way of exploring Kenan's transformation of the southern gothic to address exclusionary discourses of community, region and nation in his tale of 16-year-old Horace Cross's struggle to reconcile his emergent ""queer"" sexuality with his experience of southern Baptist Christianity. In ways that supplement and complicate Stockton's queer theory, Kenan deploys gothic tropes of the monstrous, haunted and doppelganger South to assert the need for transformation, not of his gay African American protagonist, but of the ""nation"" that has formed and rejected him. Horace is, as Johnson would say, an instance of ""theory in the flesh,"" and if Horace's flesh is graphically destroyed at the end of A Visitation of Spirits, I demonstrate, its implications resonate for the region and nation.",Katherine Henninger,Annual Conference of The Society for the Study of Multi Ethnic Literature of the United States,05/06/18,,,,,“Quaring Childhood: Transgression and Transformation in Randall Kenan’s A Visitation of Spirits”

At the same time, many of the materials written in or about those languages are difficult to locate in the world's libraries. This is because until recently libraries have lacked standards for accurately cataloging their collections according to the name of the language or dialect.

14098,FA-252384-17,"In April of 1969, Rabbi James Rudin wrote a report to Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, executive director of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), about a meeting with Clyde Ferguson, President Nixon's personal representative for responding to the Nigeria-Biafra war. Things were not going well in Biafra; the nightly relief flights were being shut down, and the option for a relief corridor through Nigeria did not look likely to get approval. Biafrans were dying, not just from starvation but attendant diseases like tuberculosis.  This paper explores how American Jews positioned themselves as part of the debate over Biafra, including their work in responding to what the Biafrans and others described as genocide. The claim was controversial, however, and many African and African American intellectuals felt that the division of Nigeria, so recently independent, was a travesty. The paper examine show American Jews were positioned as part of the global pro-Biafra movement. It considers not only the politics of Holocaust memory as it played out in the wake of Biafra, but also how American Jewish organizations (led by the AJC) took up the Biafran cause in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.  I ask how Biafra figured among the constellation of political causes that were of interest to American Jews from 1967 to 1970, including Vietnam, Israel, and anti-apartheid. I argue that Jews responded to the Biafran cause both because they saw resonances with Jewish history and because they saw in Biafra an opportunity for relatively non-controversial ecumenical cooperation.  At a time when Jews were at the heart of the liberal and left-wing coalitions against apartheid and the US war in Vietnam, and were also increasingly identifying with Israel in the wake of the 1967 war, Biafran relief was a non-political politics clothed in ecumenism, one that served well for a group still uncertain about its own whiteness, and its rapidly evolving status as an ethnic-religious minority.",Melani McAlister,American Studies Association,11/8/2018,,,,,Not Just Churches: American Jews and the Nigeria-Biafra War

14127,FA-252602-17,"The Rev. J. G. Wood notes, in his popular book Common Objects of the Microscope (London, 1861), ""Many seeds can be well examined when mounted in Canada balsam, the manner of performing which task is simple enough, and yet is often very perplexing to a beginner. Very little apparatus is required. … The great di?culty in mounting objects in Canada balsam is to keep them free from air bubbles; but by proceeding in the following manner, very little di?culty will be found.""  In this passage, ostensibly about examining seeds, Wood is actually remarking upon one of the most commonly used substances of the microscopist's practice, Canada balsam. This is a turpentine made from the sap of (as the name suggests) the balsam ?r tree of Canada. It was used for mounting microscopic slides and for rendering microscopic objects transparent because pure dry Canada balsam has a very high refractive index, similar to crown glass.Wood's book is founded on this quintessential paradox of nineteenth-century microscopy, its juxtaposition of popular access and elite skill.  Canada Balsam is an ideal lens through which to examine microscopy's (and Wood's) mashup of ease and di?culty, man of the street and of the laboratory. This substance acts not only as glue and preservative but as an actual lens as well: Wood, speaking to a broad audience, does not scorn ""those penny microscopes, composed of a pill-box and a drop of Canada balsam, which are hawked about the streets by the ingenious and deserving manufacturer.""  While this familiar unguent was also a crucial ingredient in a popular cough syrup and in the almost mythical ""Balm of Gilead,"" Canada Balsam was perhaps most valuable as a export to microscopists: this ""common object"" of Canada thus preserving the ""common objects"" -- and the rare ones, too -- of England.",Meegan Kennedy,North American Victorian Studies Association,11/18/17,,,,,Looking at things with difficulty: Canada balsam and the Common Objects of the Microscope

But the divide was blurry: the membership overlapped, and Quekett meetings often consisted of outings and comic songs as well as informative sessions.  If the RMS and Quekett circulated microscopy through their meetings, both also did so by publishing journals. The Transactions of the Microscopical Society of London appeared in 1844, replacing an earlier journal. A reader's suggestion in Harkwicke's Science Gossip, taken up by M. C. Cooke, sparked the Quekett, whose Journal of Microscopy began in 1868.

Yet, the data sources that can provide such knowledge over a broad temporal or spatial scale are dispersed and not in a readily usable format for data analytic tasks. At the Spatial Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, we are building novel map processing technologies to unlock detailed geographic information from maps. Our open source software, Strabo, ""reads"" scanned maps for automatically identifying historical locations of places. Our recent collaboration with a title insurance company in the United Kingdom illustrates the significance of this work. Using Strabo, the insurance company is automatically reading historical Ordnance Survey maps (circa 1900 – 1970) covering the entire U.K. to identify likely locations of subterranean contamination, such as factories, mines, quarries, and gas works, which no longer exist and which otherwise would not be known today.  In 2016, we were awarded by the National Science Foundation for a three-year project to build spatially and temporally linked geographic datasets from all editions of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) historical topographic maps. This NSF project will develop an approach and software that automatically transform the geographic information in thousands of historical maps to machine-understandable datasets.

I envision a map processing, modeling, linking, and publishing framework that allows querying historical map collections as a unified and structured spatiotemporal source in which individual geographic phenomena (extracted from maps) are modeled with semantic descriptions and linked to other data sources (e.g., DBpedia). This framework will make it possible to efficiently study historical spatiotemporal datasets on a large scale. Realizing such a framework poses significant research challenges in multiple fields in computer science including digital map processing, data integration, and the Semantic Web technologies, and other disciplines such as spatial, earth, social, and health sciences.

14198,HT-251006-16,"With this contribution, I discuss how the notion of structural balance in networks can contribute to a greater understanding of the circulation of knowledge and ideas between Catholic Tuscany and the Calvinist Dutch Republic. It questions how scholars between these two opposite societies could maintain a balance between, on the other hand, the desire to circulate knowledge, and on the other, the need to avoid tensions. These tensions ranged from restrictions imposed by the Sant'Uffizio, to scholarly rivalries, jealously and competition. Drawing on insights from Social Network Analysis, this paper explores how structural balance can be used to reason about how fissures in an epistolary network may arise from the dynamics of conflicts, disagreement and antagonism between corresponding scholars. The notion of structural balance offers to capture positive and negative links to understand the tensions between these two forces, which either enables or blocks the flow of information throughout the early modern network.   In the context of EMDA2017, with the help of visiting faculty member Sebastian Ahnert, an algorithm was developed to assess the applicability of the structural balance theory in historical research.",Ingeborg van Vugt,Renaissance Society of America,03/23/2018,,,,,Keeping the balance: conflicts and reconciliations in the early modern network

At the same time, the policy shifts that unfolded after Camille also broadened the range of voluntary disaster relief organizations that would become highly visible components of post-disaster landscapes. Driving both transformations was the increasingly contested role of the American National Red Cross (ANRC), a non-governmental organization to which Congress had delegated disaster relief for individuals in the early 20th century. Following Camille, critiques of racial discrimination by local ANRC units in Mississippi led to calls for national, public provision; while at the same time, critics derided the organization's bureaucratic and insensitive relationship with disaster victims and obtained official recognition of faith-based groups such as the Salvation Army and Mennonite Disaster Relief.",Andrew Morris,"Policy History Conference (Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ)",05/17/2018,https://jph.asu.edu/2018-program,"The paper is not available electronically, but can be produced upon request.

14218,HT-251006-16,"The Wellcome Library manuscript MS 7113 epitomizes the promise of working with recipe books to reconstruct early modern social networks. Owned by Lady Anne Fanshawe and later inherited by her daughter, MS 7113 shows the effects of marriages, politics, and social upheavals on early modern domestic life, and its yet-unstudied marginal notations and recipes written in English and Spanish bear the influence of Lady Anne's travels to France, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. As these notations often indicate who donated recipes to the household and as particular dishes such as ""seviche"" and ""Spanish Bacon"" specify recipe and ingredient location, MS 7113 hints at both the social networks within which the Fanshawes operated as well as the way English households engaged with foreign cookery and medicine.   This presentation will trace intersections between Lady Anne's travels and recipe collecting habits while also demonstrating how today's collaborative methods are bringing to light the networks that created early modern manuscript recipe collections.

14358,FZ-256516-17,"In September, 1882, a piece of fiction entitled ""Madame de Sade"" appeared on the front pages of Le Figaro. In the story, the young writer Valérie Milotte is sentenced to three months in prison and a fine of two thousand francs because of her salacious publications.   When Marc de Montifaud read ""Madame de Sade"" in the daily paper, she was livid. At the time, there was only one woman in France who had been relentlessly pursued by the court system for salacious writing, and that woman was her. She felt she had no choice but to take the matter into her own hands, literally: she slapped Magnard across the face with his own newspaper at the premiere of the Comédie Francaise. She was in a tailcoat and pants at the time, because—as she noted in her account—having taken on the custom of wearing men's clothing a few years prior, she always wore the appropriate attire for the occasion.My talk will consider this episode as a unique vantage point for considering Marc de Montifaud as a nineteenth-century ""gender outlaw""—to take up Kate Bornstein's notion, which designates someone whose very identity troubles social structures, even when they have no desire to rebel or flout the law. Montifaud did not fit into the available categories for understanding challenges to gender norms in her time. As a result, she worked to make sense of herself by drawing on historical figures who had similarly defied social expectations. By considering the role of gender in her self-defense, my paper will attempt to make sense of the disconnect between Montifaud's own proud self-image, inscribed in French history and tradition, and the scandalous reputation thrust upon her, which imagined her as a threat to those very forces.",Rachel Mesch,Nineteenth-Century French Studies,10/27/2018,,,,,"The Slap: Marc de Montifaud, Gender, and the Nineteenth-Century News Cycle"

In the staging of ""true crime"" stories by writers as diversely oriented as Gwendolyn Brooks, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Richard Wright, and Flannery O'Connor, we see a shared interest in capturing a kind of ""criminal evidence"" not admissible, or relevant, in the courts: the kind of psychological material that made coherent motive finally impossible to identify, thus asserting literature as an important form of ""evidence"" in its own right.

14408,HB-251297-17,"In Holt v. United States (1910), Justice Holmes established a formal distinction between the evidence of the voice and the evidence of the body, marking the Supreme Court's adoption of the Fifth Amendment as a privilege regarding testimonial evidence only. But by the 1950s, developments in police procedure, crossed with due process decisions of the Warren Court, provoked new deliberations on doctrinally held Cartesian distinctions between the mind and the body: that is, between registers according to which a legal person may be taken by the police as a voluntary source of their own ""evidence."" In Rochin v California (1952), Justices Black and Douglas extended the privilege of the Fifth Amendment by invoking the bodily boundaries implied by the Fourth, to include: ""words taken from his lips, capsules taken from his stomach, blood taken from his veins."" But 13 years later, in Schmerber v. California (1966), Justice Brennan would again limit the scope of the Fifth Amendment protection to ""testimonial evidence,"" explicitly excluding all forms of ""physical"" evidence from the protection against self-incrimination: blood, fingerprints, voice and handwriting samples, and standing in a line-up. The decision split the Court 5-4, with each dissent (including that of Chief Justice Warren) citing due process concerns raised by allowing the forcible extraction of evidence from the body as excluded from the right to protection from self-incrimination.  This paper considers the stakes of such juridical distinctions in the context of how American writers dramatized resonant relations of power between the state and the individual throughout a period that put intense pressure on the limits of police power and the integrity of the body: that of de jure and de facto racial segregation. Texts to be considered include Richard Wright's The Man Who Lived Underground (1941), William Faulkner's Requiem for a Nun (1950), and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960).",Rachel K Watson,"ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF LAW, CULTURE, AND THE HUMANITIES TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONFERENCE",03/16/2018,http://http://lawculturehumanities.com/past-conferences/,"ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF LAW, CULTURE, AND THE HUMANITIES TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONFERENCE",,,“‘Blood taken from his veins’: Self-Incrimination and the Limits of Personhood.”

14592,RQ-50772-13,"At nearly every concert of Javanese gamelan music outside of Indonesia, there is a good chance that someone in the audience will want to know the answer to the following question: ""What were they singing about just now?"" And there is just as good a chance that no one present will be able to answer, because 1) the musicians themselves are unlikely to know fully what the words mean, and 2) the lyrics are extremely heterogeneous and include many lines that do not carry any propositional meaning (the first part of a riddle or of a rhymed couplet, for instance), such that a full answer to that question would take many hours to explain. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the texts in much traditional Javanese gamelan music, it is often impossible to summarize the meaning of the texts in a single piece, let alone in an entire concert. This leads to the following questions: is there an ""about"" in the lyrics of Javanese gamelan music, and, if not, what function might the lyrics play in gamelan performance?  After analyzing the different relations between words and music in various musical and literary genres in Javanese vocal music (which, to be sure, includes genres in which the music can be said to express the words, and the words are about something), I consider whether a distinctively Javanese way of incorporating poetry into music--which predominates in traditional gendhings (gamelan pieces)--isn't partly responsible for a decline in the popularity of traditional gamelan music in Java. That is, with mass-mediated popular music dominating the airwaves in Indonesia, listeners come to expect fairly straightforward, relatable lyrics that not only are about something, but are expressed in the music, as well. Yet, could it be that the more enigmatic, fragmentary, ""aboutless"" way of using texts in gamelan music could be seen as partaking of a postmodern aesthetic, and hence could help give it a newfound cachet?",Marc Benamou,"Gamelan Culture: Roots, Expression, and World View (part of the International Gamelan Festival) Panel: “Praxis and Gamelan Aesthetics” Held at Institut Seni Indonesia in Surakarta, Indonesia",08/11/2018,,,,,"""Apakah Ada 'Tentangnya'?

14623,PR-253389-17,"Digital humanities brings unique challenges and opportunities to ""keeping data alive"" that are leading to innovative cross- disciplinary solutions. Data preservation involves standards, guidelines, open-source vs. proprietary software, accessibility, and much more. While establishing best practices, cultivating a community of experts, and developing infrastructure for 3D data used in cultural heritage has been the focus of several coordinated efforts in Europe over the past decade, efforts have been less systematic in the United States. Recently, however, digital humanities practitioners have spearheaded 3D data preservation and sharing in the United States.   While humanities scholarship uses many types of 3D models, the case study focuses on 3D models of ancient Maya architecture generated from multiple data sources including architectural drawings, excavation reports, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and airborne LiDAR. To contribute to 3D data preservation efforts, while maintaining realistic goals, the MayaCityBuilder Project focuses on procedural modeling—rapid prototyping of 3D models from a set of rules. Procedural modeling is ideally suited for the development of 3D modeling standards that promote data interoperability, dissemination, and reuse because they bring with them the underlying metadata, paradata (information about modeling choices), and descriptive data.   We present an overview of the workflows we are developing to serve our objective of data reuse and more broadly access and preservation of 3D data. Additionally, we discuss how these workflows relate to the next phase of the project, i.e., prototype development. The prototype will take advantage of recent developments in web technology, namely the adoption of WebGL that renders interactive 2D and 3D computer graphics in browsers without plugins.","Heather Richards-Rissetto, Rachel Opitz, Fabrizio Galeazzi",Digital Humanities 2018 Puentes-Bridges (Mexico City),6/29/2019,http://https://dh2018.adho.org/abstracts/,,,,Keeping 3D Data Alive (KDA): Developments in the MayaCityBuilder Project

This capacity will be put into (preliminary) practice in real time among audience members.   The paper will begin with a five-minute PowerPoint history of the analog inception and into-digital growth of the APWA.

14671,FA-251848-17,"Although no Caribbean country has a Muslim majority population, Islam has been an important presence for at least five centuries. The major conduits of Islam in the region were labor schemes: African slavery and Indian indenture. At the same time, Islam's Caribbean journeys included explorers and emigrants who hailed from diverse societies and cultures around the globe, and who have been devotees of varying schools of Islamic thought. Scholarship on Caribbean Islam and Muslims typically has emphasized either Africans or Indians, although also acknowledging the heterogeneous practitioners and practices that define them. These complexities have important implications for the ways that racial and religious identities are characterized with regard to Caribbean Muslims. Based on my forthcoming book, my presentation considers the ways that ""African"" and ""Indian"" racial identities in the Caribbean are constituted through their historical intersection with ideas about religion and religious identities. I argue that this nexus—the racialization of religion and religionization of race—is key to understanding the hierarchies of human ""types"" that inform the perception and the practice of Islam in the colonial and post-independence eras.

Today, we readily recognize a pervasive Eurocentrism in these entries, among other flaws. But at the time, the Britannica editions were the most authoritative comprehensive representation in the English-speaking world of knowledge as a whole. Knowledge has changed since that time, and it changed during the publication of this material, from 1790-1911. This data set documents those changes. The goal of this project is identify patterns in the transformation of knowledge by mining the final data set. All of these works are available on the web, but their textual data is too inaccurate for valid text mining. This project thus creates the first accurate TEI edition of this valuable resource. The full corpus consists of 100,000 articles derived from 80,000 print pages. The TEI will be supplemented with metadata using Named Entity Recognition. The Metadata Research Center at Drexel University will further enrich the data by adding subject metadata from both current and historical vocabularies, using an automated recognition program they developed.

14689,FN-255581-17,"""Komuz"" is a Nilo-Saharan (N-S) language family first proposed by Bender (1989, 1991) based on Greenberg's (1963) initial subgrouping of Koman and Gumuz languages within the N-S phylum.  Bender 1989 originally proposed that Gumuz and Koman had a distant relationship within the same subfamily labeled ""Komuz"", but he later recanted (1997, 2000) stating these two groups had ""no special relationship"" (2000: 56).   Since then, others have maintained that these two groups do indeed show special relationship to each other (save Dimmendaal 2011), offering competing classifications which disagree as to a) whether these two are part of the greater N-S phylum and b) where they might fit within the phylum; Ehret (2001), Blench (personal communication), and Ahland (2013) maintain its N-S membership while Dimmendaal (2008, 2011) casts some doubt on its membership, stating that ""very few of the more widespread nominal and verbal morphological markers of Nilo-Saharan are attested in the Coman languages plus Gumuz"" (2008: 843). More recently, Dimmendaal et al. tentatively have placed Koman and Gumuz as an outlier branch in an N-S tree (forthcoming) even though Dimmendaal had previously listed Koman as an ""independent family"" and Gumuz as an ""isolate"" (2011: 408). All of these classifications differ greatly from each other as well as from Bender's 1991 Komuz proposal.   In this paper, I present evidence further supporting a Komuz subgroup within N-S and explore evidence for establishing a distant relationship with the Eastern Sudanic subfamily, which together form the ""Core"" subgroup of N-S as Bender had initially proposed. New evidence from the previously unknown language Daats'i´in further supports this proposal. Similarities between a possible Komuz family and Eastern Sudanic are assessed in terms of whether there is evidence for shared retentions versus shared innovations, keeping in mind areal patterns and borrowing as possible explanations.","Ahland, Colleen",The 14th Nilo-Saharan Linguistics Conference,06/01/2019,,,https://linguistlist.org/issues/29/29-3072.html,Linguist List CONFERENCE Announcements,Revisiting Komuz: new evidence that supports an old proposal

Starting in the third century CE (excluding ""Old Coptic""), Coptic used an alphabet based on the Greek and several added Demotic letters. A large but understudied corpus of literary texts exists in Coptic, including important Gnostic, monastic and Manichaean texts, as well as early Biblical translations. Efforts to build a digital Coptic corpus are still in their initial phases. In this paper, we present the most recent work in a partnership of Digital Humanities projects. Coptic SCRIPTORIUM (Schroeder and Zeldes, 2016) is a major initiative endeavoring to put corpora online which are linguistically and philologically annotated (i.e. supporting grammatical, paleographical and literary annotations), while projects in Göttingen are producing digital editions of Coptic texts focusing on philological standards and critical editions: A project at the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities is preparing a complete digital edition of the Coptic Old Testament (Behlmer and Feder, 2017), and in a project of Collaborative Research Centre 1136 ""Education and Religion"" digital diplomatic editions of selected works of Shenoute and Besa, 4th-5th century abbots of the White Monastery in Upper Egypt, are being prepared for text reuse research.

14892,RA-254182-17,"This paper looks at famed chemist (or chymist) Robert Boyle's Origin of Forms and Qualities and considers an un-named target of Boyle: William Harvey. Boyle published Origin of Forms and Qualities in 1666 as an attempt to eliminate reliance on Aristotelian forms, promoting instead his own corpuscular philosophy. In ""The Historical Part"" of Origin of Forms and Qualities, Boyle provides examples and experiments historically understood as involving substantial change, which he attempts to describe in terms of quality-less, uniform corpuscles.  His very first example involves the hatching of an egg, or the development of a chick from diaphanous fluid. This paper argues that Boyle's use of this example —from his introduction of it, to his description of how the egg develops, to his concluding remarks regarding the explanatory power of Harvey's ""plastick principle""— is a direct response to. Harvey had communicated his own views on the generation of chick eggs some fifteen years prior in Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium.  A detailed analysis of his reply to Harvey can allow us to understand not only Boyle's own account of animal generation but his methodical commitments more generally. Harvey holds that proper explanation lies in an account of the four Aristotelian causes, and his description of the plastic principle within the chick-egg is closely tied to his account of those causes. Boyle, however, rejects this approach and places the explanatory focus upon the material effects and modes of operations.",Ashley J.

Though categorized commonly as part of an ""Islamic world""—and thus omitted from many would-be global histories of alcohol, the Ottoman Empire included many sites and situations meriting consideration.  Though Ottoman leaders pronounced firm proscriptions during the war for its military, it often relied on religious and moral arguments when offering justification for prohibition. Following WWI, added rationale emerged from both state and society.  Proposed, debated, and passed in 1920, the Turkish republic's prohibition only lasted until 1924, when the costs of the experiment were more evident and once Kemalists consolidated their authority.

14943,RA-50142-14,"Scale (which encompasses time, space, and causation) has become the most relevant topic in 21st century historiography. And while most historians think intensely about scale (namely, how to deal with it themselves), they have only recently (with a few exceptions, of course) started to both historicize and theorize the very term that divides the profession, its subfields, and its methodologies. Many historians—while confronting the Anthropocene—are calling for ""global"" histories, ""deeper"" histories, and ""bigger"" histories (to use the adjectives that are being employed in new course titles, including my own). But many others are rightfully skeptical, for how much nuance is lost (how much violence is done) as we amalgamate the particularities of the human experience into sweeping narratives that can account for global phenomena like Climate Change.  I would like to suggest that animals may provide one solution to the problem of Scale. Seeing animals as subjects in the past, and looking for their lives, biographies, cultures, and particularities can help us tie together the ""scale gaps"" that divide historiography. Furthermore, seeing animals can help us enact a more ecological vision.   In particular, this paper will think about historical scales by following fish through the Great Lakes. It will reinvigorate ecological niche theory for the purpose of placing fish and humans into history, or more precisely, into different, yet overlapping, histories, calibrated to different scalar visions. This paper will suggest that niche models may be useful in 1.) finding ""agencies"" in, around, and between animal collectivities without anthropomorphizing or essentializing any single individual, 2.) conceptualizing various scales together, and 3.) fusing animal history with historical ecology in a manner that foregrounds both human and nonhuman subjects at the same time.",Daniel Vandersommers,"Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts (SLSA) 2018",11/16/2018,http://litsciarts.org/slsa18/,"Website for 2018 Conference for Literature, Science and the Arts",,,"“Fish and the Problem of (Historical) Scales”,"

Zoos, though, can also tell (bio)political stories. While zoogoers themselves rarely encountered politics along zoo footpaths, in the halls of Congress the ties that bound the National Zoo and its animals to politics proved more visible, especially when the topic of the zoo exploded into years of intense sectional debate in the House of Representatives. The National Zoological Park, as the only zoo in American history whose governance fell under the purview of the federal legislature, offers a unique window into a semiology that fused animals to debates about government that divided a nation through and after the Civil War.

Local activities in one state were understood potentially to ""affect other States,"" as Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in Gibbons v. Ogden (1824).  But another powerful strand of constitutional thought resisted this expansive notion of federal commerce.  This imperative was an unsettled but deep commitment to concurrent power.  States clearly had the power to regulate some forms of commerce under their traditional police powers.  Between 1801 and 1835, the Marshall Court confronted a series of prominent cases that required it to define the federal power to regulate commerce.  These controversies concerned diverse areas of activity, including the use of the waterways; the importation of foreign goods; and the status of free black sailors in southern ports.  All these cases concerned crossings of borders, whether by vessels, goods, or people.  Which sovereign could govern those vessels, goods, and people when they crossed those borders was the central issue connecting this disparate array of cases.

15017,RQ-255779-17,"The Way of the Poet-King (Kavirajamarga?), composed around 870, has a strong claim to be the earliest Kannada text to survive in manuscript form, and arguable did more than any other text to establish this ""regional language"" of South India as a literary idiom more or less on par with Sanskrit. The Way can be characterized, fairly, as a product of the Imperial Ra??raku?a court, as a transcreation of an important work of poetics in Sanskrit, namely Da??in's Mirror of Poetry (Kavyadarsa), and as a watershed moment in the history of Kannada literature. Our talk will take another look at these three aspects of the Way, but we will emphasize the ""twos"" that make each of them more complex: its two authors (Srivijaya and Nr?patu?ga), the two works of poetics that served as its primary models (Da??in's Mirror and Bhamaha's Ornament), and the two languages whose relationship to each other is one of the text's primary concerns (Sanskrit and Kannada).","Sarah Pierce Taylor, Andrew Ollett","South Asia Seminar, University of Chicago",01/25/2018,,,,,"The Way of the Poet-King: Two Authors, Two Models, Two Languages"
15018,RQ-255779-17,"What makes a poetic fault a fault? Inversely, what makes a poetic virtue a virtue? What are the different frameworks of assessment internal to a language that determine such good and bad qualities? When Sanskrit and vernacular languages came into contact, how were these different linguistic frameworks negotiated? As is clear from Sheldon Pollock's work, S´ri¯vijaya's ninth-century Kavira¯jama¯rgam?, the first extant text to theorize the Kannada language, is an ideal case study for thinking about the relationship Sanskrit and vernacular languages, in this case Kannada. However, beyond the larger meta-theoretical point about vernacularization, much work remains to be done in clarifying the precise ways in which vernacular languages emerged through and alongside Sanskrit. This paper closely reads S´ri¯vijaya's Kavira¯jama¯rgam?, paying close attention to the moments of negotiation and adaptation between Sanskrit and Kannada. I focus, in particular, on S´ri¯vijaya's section on poetic flaws or do¯s?as. Spanning over a hundred verses, this lengthy section of the first chapter delineates poetic faults in relation to various parts of language including mixed Sanskrit and Kannada compounds, meter, and similes among many others. Here we see S´ri¯vijaya artfully incorporate material from both Dan?d?in's Ka¯vyadars´a and Bha¯maha's Ka¯vya¯lan?ka¯ra. However, this section is also a moment when S´ri¯vijaya inverts a preexistent Sanskrit rule that metrically violating the caesura (yatibhan?ga) is considered a fault. Following ancient Kannada scholars who ""lovingly proposed even faults as virtues,"" S´ri¯vijaya renames yatibhan?ga as khanda pra¯sa and states that it is preeminent (atis´aya) (KRM, v. 1.75). This example brings us to the limits of a Sanskrit driven model of vernacularization. If Kannada as a literary language emerged through the lexical invasion of Sanskrit, then there are limits to that encounter such as when a Sanskrit fault becomes a Kannada virtue.",Sarah Pierce Taylor,,10/15/2017,,,,,When a Sanskrit Fault is a Kannada Virtue

In Europe in 1919, Terrell divided her time between networking with powerful African and Asian statesmen in Paris, imploring white feminists to recognize racial inequality as an impediment to peace and freedom, and fighting the segregated American military for the right to visit the devastated regions of northern France.

15078,FEL-257802-18,"I want to suggest that the treatment of women is central to the literary history of St. Bartholomew's. The dynamic of contamination and purification that always attends the hospital, in its liminal location, is urgently embodied by women, with their inherent physical and mental weaknesses. Today I briefly consider the treatment of women in two works probably written around the turn of the fifteenth century: a Middle English religious narrative (The Book of the Foundation of St. Bartholomew's Church), and a Latin medical compendium (Breviarium Bartholomei, or the Breviary of Bartholomew). My discussion juxtaposes the Book and Breviarium on the topics of losing and regaining, or at least simulating, virginity. I argue that while the priory's foundation narrative represents women as vulnerable to sexual contamination that is exacerbated by the hospital, and can only be purified by a flight from sexuality, the hospital's medical text offers a much more nuanced view of the sexual lives of single women. In these two works we see competing views of virginity: on the one hand, as a ""treasure"" that once lost, can never be regained, and on the other, as both a physical state and an ongoing social performance.",Nicole R.

The fragile records, transferred to Bethlehem in the 1960s and 1970s, are now in the process of being conserved and digitized, thanks to generous grants in 2018 from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). A selection of these records – documenting Moravian life and worship in St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, Trinidad, Tobago, Dominican Republic, Antigua and St. Kitts – are soon to be accessible online through the Digital Library of the Caribbean. Perhaps owing to limited access conditions, the EWI Collection constitutes a significant but underutilized source body of minutes, correspondence, personnel records, membership records, diaries, school records, linguistic materials, memoirs, and finances. The coinciding conservation and digitization projects warranted improved understandings and descriptions of such records by MAB archivists. During this time, unique opportunities were discovered and considered for researchers working in the fields of Caribbean studies, Moravian studies, and digital humanities.

15204,RZ-255635-17,"In Southwest Asia, the archaeological record of the late Pleistocene exhibits a wide diversity of economic, technological, social and symbolic practices, providing an increasingly nuanced picture of prehistoric behavior. Traditional approaches that focused on the distinctions between hunter-gatherers and food-producers are proving overly simplistic as economic categories are blurred, and the social and ideological practices of these peoples are emphasized. Isolating economic events are difficult, as are reconstructing the impetuses and processes by which these events might have occurred. Much research on contemporary hunter-gatherers has abandoned economic labels in favor of understanding and contextualizing hunter-gatherer ontologies. With a rich dataset over the transition from hunter-gatherer to food-producer in Southwest Asia, we are beginning to explore the value of focusing on the social and ideological worlds of these Pleistocene groups. Much of this work, however, relies on ethnographic analogy and requires a critical approach to its use. With recognition of a ‘long Neolithic' (and debates about whether this is a valid approach to transition), one must ask whether there is a mismatch between archaeological and anthropological usage of the term ‘hunter-gatherer'? Is ethnoarchaeology and ethnography relevant for identifying, defining and interpreting the behavior of archaeological hunter-gatherers? These issues are explored here using the Epipalaeolithic site of Kharaneh IV and the concept of place-making as a case study.",Lisa A. Maher,"Hunter-Gatherers, Farmers and the Long Neolithic’.

Using white-light confocal microscopy, we analyze manufacturing traces to identify the gestures and tools used to create the plaquette. This artifact, although the only engraved piece recovered from Kharaneh IV thus far, links into wider networks of Epipalaeolithic interaction and cultural exchange. Placing the Kharaneh IV engraved object into regional context with other Early/Middle Epipalaeolithic artistic artifacts, we explore wider networks of interaction prior to the Natufian.","Lisa A.

15206,RZ-255635-17,"Searching for the origin points of major cultural revolutions and transitions has long been a driver of archaeological research, yet led to research focused on perceived boundaries, rather than continuity. Research into the origins of so-called modern human behavior, the origins of social complexity, the earliest domesticates, among others, all focus on defining moments of change that may be undetectable in the archaeological record. Perhaps some of the most enduring archaeological questions revolve around the ‘origins of agriculture'. In this paper, we explore changing historical conceptions of the ‘origins of agriculture' in Southwest Asia in archaeological discourse and how, through the lens of the longue durée, we can trace aspects of material culture, human action, and complex human-landscape dynamics in deep time. Using examples from the Epipalaeolithic of eastern Jordan, we address current debates on Neolithization by exploring the implications of perspectives that focus on ‘becoming' Neolithic and ‘being' a hunter-gatherer. Through this perspective we discuss different scales of material culture analysis; from the ‘ethnographic' lens identifying individual behaviors in the past, to the longue durée of material culture trends. This multi-scalar perspective gives insights into how we construct cultural boundaries and understand change during the ‘origins of agriculture'.","Danielle A. Macdonald, Lisa A.

AMPACT uses a score-informed approach to estimate timing, pitch, and loudness parameters from both monophonic and, now, polyphonic audio.

These four features were evaluated on four-part multi-track ensemble recordings, consisting of either four vocalists or bassoon, clarinet, saxophone, and violin (the Bach10 data set) created from polyphonic mixes of the monophonic tracks both with and without artificial reverberation. Score information was used to identify time-frequency regions of interest in the polyphonic mixes for each note in a corresponding aligned score, from which f0 and power estimates were made.

Catalogue services in an SDI are typically based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) standard which defines common interfaces for accessing the metadata information.  A search engine is a software system capable of supporting fast and reliable search, which may use ""any means necessary"" to get users to the resources they need quickly and efficiently. These techniques may include features such as full text search, natural language processing, weighted results, fuzzy tolerance results, faceting, hit highlighting, recommendations, feedback mechanisms based on log mining, usage statistic gathering, and many others. In this paper we will be focusing on improving geospatial search with a search engine platform that uses Lucene, a Java-based search library, at its core.  In work funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Centre for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard University is in the process of re-engineering the search component of its public domain SDI (WorldMap http://worldmap.harvard.edu ) which is based on the GeoNode platform.

15413,HT-231812-15,"[final paragraph of much longer abstract] Digital Humanities articulates three parallel interdisciplinary commitments to ""openness"": 1) a commitment to open access publishing; 2) a commitment to open access/open source software development; and 3) a commitment to open access data. While the first two trends have received deep and lasting attention via scholarly publishing and digital commons enterprises and the open source development movement promoted by github and other code repositories, the commitment to open access data has been largely undertheorized. Using case studies of Digital Humanities projects that have been developed using Native American and Indigenous content, this submission suggests that Native and Indigenous content complicates the current technical application of open source development driven by digital aggregators and application programming interface development. By highlighting ethical issues around the use, reuse, and distributed architectures encouraged by common digital humanities technologies, this submission suggests that the rhetoric and practice of the open access data movement obscures both Native agency in determining the use of community materials as well as the role of technical determinism in proliferating the violence of colonial archives on Native communities. Questions this submission engages with include: How do we deal with born-digital research data in Native American and Indigenous contexts? How do we as scholars responsibly engage in digital research in Native communities? How do organizations and institutions navigate the cultural, legal, and ethical contexts of the communities whose objects they hold? How can free and open source software solutions be leveraged to build community engagement?

15433,HD-248437-16,"An important dimension of digital humanities pedagogy involves engaging students with what lies ""under the hood"": with the intellectual architecture of familiar tools and resources. Text markup is an especially compelling topic in the literature and history classroom, for a number of reasons. It engages students in a very close analytical examination of the text, and makes the results of that examination explicit. It prompts a discussion of how we read and interpret documents and for what purpose. It supports inquiry into textual materiality, the significance of print cultures, and historical contexts of primary source documents. It offers an introduction to basic methods of editing, annotation, and explication, and it offers an introduction to a set of tools that are increasingly central to digital humanities scholarship—which have significant professional value outside the academy as well. For all of these reasons, the TEI is a tool of growing importance and pedagogical value for the humanities classroom.

The continuously expanding database of the Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama (APGRD; represented in Macintosh et al. 2005), the encompassing of substantial non-western material in comparative literary studies (Damrosch 2003), and the inclusion of vast quantities of non-canonical works enabled by text digitisation (Moretti 2009, Barker and Terras 2016, Long and So 2016) collectively entail new forms of data gathering and visual presentation, which in turn open new hermeneutic horizons.  This paper draws inspiration from computational biology to offer a new method of organising, visualising, and interpreting the reception histories of literary works, focusing on classical drama. We repurpose a technique known as phylogenetic profiling to chart the evolution of Plautus' Amphitryon through a sample of 22 adaptations ranging from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. The paper describes the new methodology, presents resulting analyses about the treatment of dramatic characters across the tradition, and discusses implications for the practice of classical reception studies. To demonstrate the scalability of the approach, we conclude by briefly describing a similar profile of Sophocles' Antigone, which incorporates 129 adaptations spanning four continents.","Ariane Schwartz, Joseph Dexter, Pramit Chaudhuri",2017 Society for Classical Studies Annual Meeting,1/7/2017,https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/148/abstract/phylogenetic-profiling-and-reception-classical-drama,,,,Phylogenetic Profiling and the Reception of Classical Drama

15586,FEL-257599-18,"This paper shows how the authors and redactors of the Islamic psalms reconciled the traditional image of David's psalmody with a Qur'anic conception of scripture. Only in psalm 1 was the Biblical text preserved. Psalm 2 was modified to preempt Christian interpretations that made it a proclamation of Jesus' divine sonship, and the beginning of Psalm 3, retained only in the Sufi recension, had to be marked as ""the words of David"" because the rest of the text is framed as God's speech, not the psalmist's. From that point on the Biblical text disappears, but the Qur'an is often quoted or paraphrased, and the coming of Muhammad is duly announced. The Koranic recension ends each psalm with a Qur'anic–sounding phrase such as ""I am Mighty and Wise."" Some manuscripts label each psalm a sura, and lay out the text as in a mu??af. Yet the Biblical Psalms are not forgotten. Amid snippets of wisdom, exhortations to prepare for the afterlife, and admonitions about a variety of sins, there appear hymns of praise, human calls for divine assistance, and echoes of the penitential Psalms. David laments his transgressions quite explicitly in some versions, though in others he is shielded from grave sin. In form, style, and content these rewritten psalms are more Qur'anic than Biblical, yet their ethos of piety, penitence, and praise have much in common with the scripture they purport to replace. Indeed, they were not intended as a challenge to the supposedly corrupted Psalms of Jews and Christians. Rather than interreligious polemic, appropriation, or forgery (as Ignaz Goldziher called them), these psalms constitute an intrareligious polemic against worldly fellow Muslims, constructed from a repertoire of motifs, aphorisms, characters, and imagined books that, in the minds of their Muslim authors, were the common property of all scrupulously pious believers.",David Vishanoff,International Qur’anic Studies Association,11/18/2018,https://david.vishanoff.com/iqsa-between-quran-and-psalmody/,Between Qur’an and Psalmody: How Medieval Muslim Piety Integrated Two Notions of Scripture,,,Between Qur’an and Psalmody: How Medieval Muslim Piety Integrated Two Notions of Scripture
15587,FEL-257599-18,"Some Arabic manuscripts of the ""Psalms of David"" contain not the Biblical Psalms but Muslim compositions that sound more like the Qur'an: not human praises and prayers to God, but God's admonitions to the prophet David, urging him to flee the pleasures of this world, spend his nights in repentant prayer, and prepare for the Day of Judgment. This new scripture exists in several recensions stemming from a single eighth– or ninth–century collection of one hundred psalms. Only a small fragment of that text has been preserved in its original form, but it was edited, rewritten, rearranged, and expanded by later editors, each of whom sought to align it to his or her own religious vision, resulting in what I call the Koranic, Orthodox, Pious, and Sufi versions. By purporting to present the authentic Psalms of David, these texts appear to embody the common Muslim claim that the Bible is textually corrupt, but in fact they show little concern for textual authenticity. Each editor freely rewrote and improved the text, using the concept of ""the Psalms of David"" as an opportunity for creative writing in a Qur'anic style. When these psalms were last studied by orientalists over a century ago, they were dismissed as polemical forgeries, but that misses the point. Their interreligious polemic is incidental; their main target is worldly Muslims. In fact, they illustrate vividly how many symbols and values their Muslim authors shared with Jews and Christians: the figure of David, his Psalms and his sins, virtue and repentance, asceticism and spirituality, heaven and hell, and a rich common stock of maxims and metaphors. At a time when both scholars of religion and the American public are probing the boundaries of western and Islamic civilizations, and making crucial decisions about whether to imagine them as distinct or bound together, this curious instance of ""rewritten Bible"" provides a concrete manifestation of the contested but interwoven moral landscape that they share.",David Vishanoff,"American Academy of Religion, Southwest Region",3/10/2019,https://david.vishanoff.com/psalms-of-the-muslim-prophet-david/,Psalms of the Muslim Prophet David: Rewritten Bible in a Qur’anic Idiom,,,Psalms of the Muslim Prophet David: Rewritten Bible in a Qur’anic Idiom

A comparative study of a dozen manuscripts shows that they are all revisions and expansions of a lost source text consisting of one hundred psalms, which newly discovered evidence (described by Ursula Bsees in another paper at this conference) allows us to date to the late eighth or early ninth century. This confirms that the source text was an early literary expression of an ascetical renunciant piety (described by Christopher Melchert and others) that flourished in the seventh, eighth, and early ninth centuries, when similar forms of Christian monastic piety were still regarded positively by some Muslims, and before Islamic asceticism lost ground to more inward and mystical forms of piety. The original text reflected what Nimrod Hurvitz calls mild asceticism, urging disdain for this world and total dependence on God without entirely rejecting private property or marriage. Later recensions of the text, however, softened and modified its ascetical tone in various ways, the Pious recension emphasizing adherence to the letter of the law, and the Sufi recension transforming David's piety from tearful fear of hell into loving devotion. These recensions reflect divergent strands in the development of Islamic piety, while testifying to David's continuing appeal as an exemplar of repentance and otherworldliness.",David Vishanoff,American Oriental Society,3/17/2019,https://david.vishanoff.com/the-ascetic-piety/,The Ascetic Piety of the Prophet David in Muslim Rewritings of the Psalms,,,The Ascetic Piety of the Prophet David in Muslim Rewritings of the Psalms

15607,RZ-249965-16,"On the Adriatic coast of southern Italy, the site of Salapia has been the focus of archaeological excavations since 2014. As a town established in the 1st c. BCE, with a long occupation into the late 8th c. CE, and later resettled by a medieval castrum, Salapia provides a unique opportunity to theorize the relationship between successive phases of settlement and social meaning in the long-term. Evidence from the 2018 campaign has detailed how, starting in the late 5th c. CE and continuing for the duration of the 6th c. CE, inhabitants repurposed the structures of the Roman and Late Antique town, with each room reworked and re-inhabited, attesting to the concentration and intensity of occupation. Such patterns continue into the 7th c. CE, although the remains of the former Roman structures were in an ever more ruined state. The continuous reoccupation wore them away, just as it was dependent on them both materially and conceptually. These standing remains appear to have still helped solidify the community connections in this landscape, and to make it distinct from other places along the coast. By the 8th c. CE, the ruins of Salapia were barely visible across the eastern portion of the coastal plain, where the new village of huts was organized differently from previous settlements. We might then identify a more decisive break with what had come before, and a transformation in the relationship between people and this landscape that was diversely (perhaps less) cohesive and sustaining of community ties, as a period of abandonment shortly followed. If the ruins were better preserved further west, they did not entice new inhabitants to them for at least another two centuries.","Goffredo, Roberto, Totten, Darian Marie","Archaeological Institute of America Annual Meeting 2019 (San Diego,  CA)",01/05/2019,,,,,"The Biography of a Reoccupied Landscape: Making Community at Salapia (Apulia,  Italy) 6th-8th c.

15608,RZ-249965-16,"Recent studies of both long-lived and extinct towns in Italy, and the empire generally, have turned to interrogating the later centuries of habitation to model patterns of continuity and abandonment in myriad forms. The site of Salapia on the Adriatic Coast of Southern Italy offers a compelling example through which to investigate the character of such settlement transformations over more nearly fifteen hundred years. While the Roman settlement was primarily located on the extensive plain adjacent to the Salpi lagoon, its western portion forms the initial deposit atop which subsequent occupations were installed, forming the topographic feature of the Monte di Salpi. The Monte's latest habitation phases are dated to the late 13th c.-early 14th c. C.E., attesting to the spatial continuity of settlement through time. New evidence from the 2017 season allows us to theorize the shifts from the Roman and late antique phases to the medieval town, providing material manifestations of how such persistent but consistently fluctuating occupation strategies were brought about. It is a narrative written through negative archaeological features as much as through positive ones. Two new trenches, one on the Monte and one at its base on the plain, provide evidence of the link between the end of late antiquity to the emergence of the medieval community.","Goffredo, Roberto, Totten, Darian Marie","Archaeological Institute of America Annual Meeting 2018 (Boston, MA).",01/05/2018,,,,,Roman Salapia-Medieval Salpi: Urban Transformations and the Shifting Material  Legacy of a port on the Adriatic Coast of Apulia

These troops often did not leave other kinds of records such as journals or diaries, and letters home were rare indeed.  Service records include important information about when and where soldiers mustered for battle and for how long they enlisted.  The accompanying records in the service jackets, while uneven and unpredictable, offer further glimpses of daily life for the troops.  The importance of horses, for instance, becomes apparent.  The records tracked the movement of federal prisoners of war from camp to camp and showed that some soldiers chose to swear the Oath of Loyalty and even joined federal units.  Other prisoners of war were exchanged.  The records also included more mundane, though consequential, information such as petitions for promotion, letters of resignation, and certificates of disability.  The records offer the opportunity to add meat to barebones data about troop movements and battle losses.

15815,HB-50448-14,"In 1929, Federico García Lorca left Spain for New York in order to find solutions to his depressed emotional state and artistic crisis. Lorca arrived in time to witness the Wall Street Crash, which emblematized capitalist modernity's inequalities. Such inequities were nowhere more apparent to Lorca than in Harlem, the refuge of New York's African-Americans, which he portrayed in a three-poem section of his volume Poet in New York [Poeta en Nueva York; 1929-30]. Lorca encountered modernity's antithesis in Harlem's vernacular and ‘high' art forms, from jazz, blues, and gospel to the Harlem Renaissance. Yet Lorca also found inspiration in the very modernity that he criticized. For not only did Lorca draw on art particular to Harlem—with its own fraught relationship to the modern—but also in forms originating in Spain and other parts of Europe—including Surrealism's embrace of individual desires.   I examine the way in which, on the one hand, Lorca looks to the vernacular art forms of the oppressed—African-Americans and Spain's rural and Roma peoples. On the other hand, the Surrealist and Harlem-Renaissance forms that he uses to portray New York are at once skeptical, and part and parcel, of capitalist modernity. Ironically, wrestling with such paradoxes provides Lorca with a means to resolve the tensions underlying his artistic and personal crises. For these paradoxes become paradigmatic of how ‘high' modernist and ‘low' vernacular forms may ethically engage each other—resisting the vernacular's recuperation and neo-Romantic notions of authenticity.",Renée M.

Such classic poetry, regarded favorably by the Spanish academic and cultural establishment, led in great part to Diego's induction into the Real Academic Española (1947) as well as the award of the Premio Cervantes to him (and Jorge Luis Borges) in 1979. Before the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), however, and among students of his work, Diego was also recognized as a key figure in the Spanish avant-garde; his poetry volumes Imagen (1922) and Manual de espumas (1924) set the pace for the poetic vanguard in 1920s Spain, especially the Creacionismo movement, although it must be emphasized that Diego should be considered as an essentially idiosyncratic poet who used different styles as he saw fit throughout his prolific corpus.   Given Diego's level of recognition as well as his achievement as a poet, it remains surprising that another crucial aspect of his work has remained largely unexplored: the engagement with popular and traditional poetry (poesía popular and poesía de tipo tradicional) and music. In actuality, Diego's fascination with popular and traditional poetry and music from the inception of his career augurs the stylization of popular and traditional forms which would become characteristic not only of his work, but also that of such Generation of 1927 figures as Rafael Alberti (1902-1999) and Federico García Lorca (1898-1936).

15823,FT-264843-19,"To stoke fears and hatred of foreign nations to serve internal needs is a recurring pattern in modern Chinese national identity discourse. Drawing upon a vast collection of Chinese leaders' political rhetoric and memoirs, party documents, and propaganda materials, as well as secondary literature, this paper investigates Mao Zendong's manipulation of anti-Soviet discourse between 1959-1969 to discredit domestic opponents and push through radical economic and political adventures. In summer 1959, facing sharp criticisms of the Great Leap Forward modeled on Revolutionary Stalinism, Mao at the Lushan Conference purged party dissidents like Peng Dehuai as ""right-ward opportunists"" with ""illicit ties"" to Moscow that also disapproved Mao's policies. Thereafter, Beijing brought Sino-Soviet ideological conflict into the open. By refuting Khrushchev's de-Stalinization and condemning his ""revisionist"" deviations from orthodox socialism, Mao silenced domestic opposition while relaunching the Leap. As the intra-party rift widened following the Leap's fiasco, Mao escalated anti-Soviet polemics and further intertwined it with internal campaigns bashing Soviet-style revisionism. This two-front war culminated in the Cultural Revolution, when ""capitalist roaders in power"" like Liu Shaoqi and just anyone who disagreed with Mao in and outside his own party were accused of being revisionists or even ""China's Khrushchev.""  At the same time, in order to justify and reinforce the great revolution at home, the Maoist faction kept the tension level with Moscow high, to the point of disrupting a normal diplomatic relationship and eventually sliding to the brink of war.",Yinan He,annual meeting of the Association of Asian Studies,03/19/2020,,,,,"Mao’s Two-Front War: Anti-Soviet Polemics and the Domestic Battle against Revisionism, 1959-1969"

The first is to release the shipwreck's narrative from its dependence on Justinian; recent finds raise doubts regarding this connection and its required chronology, freeing the vessel to serve as a broader marker of routine Late Antique connectivity. The second is to examine how this assemblage can inform our understanding of the shape and resilience of the maritime economy in the decades preceding Justinian's reign. By evaluating the potential scale and radiating effects of this ship's loss, we argue for a much broader impact on connectivity that went beyond simply one expensive architectural project.

Alongside re-evaluation of the major architectural elements, analysis of the shipboard assemblage, secondary cargo, and broader historical context provides new clues about private commercial and directed exchange, local and imperial patronage and propaganda, and maritime connectivity more generally.

Who can be a journalist in Haiti today? How have notions of truth and objectivity in Haitian journalism evolved through the late 20th century to the early 21st century? As technology increasingly allows for preservation of what were once impermanent media, might journalists consider themselves not only collectors and disseminators of information, but also documentarians of the past and of history.

15946,FEL-257721-18,"The folklore of French- and Creole-speaking Louisiana is composed of many influences that reflect the diverse cultural landscape of the region. In the field of folklore, the linguistic barrier has posed problems of accessibility and accuracy of analyses. Earlier work (Bascom, Abraham) presented these tales exclusively in English translation and simply as part ""Southern folklore"". On the other hand, francophone scholars (Ancelet 1994, Rabalais 2015) have focused on the repertoire in the context of the greater francophonie.  This presentation questions the prevalence of a folklore ""pantheon"" consisting of a handful of figures in popular representations, children's books, cultural festivals, etc. I argue that characters, especially the Rougarou and Bouki and Lapin, have enjoyed increased popularity over recent years because they are easily identifiable and similar to figures already present in American folklore (i.e. Werewolf and Brer Rabbit). Moreover, a survey of available collections (e.g. Fortier, Saucier, Claudel, Ancelet) indicate a much more varied cast of animal characters without a clear affinity for a few specific figures. This line of questioning can shed light on the specificity of Louisiana's French and Creole folklore, the interplay between French Louisiana and mainstream American culture, and the status of folklore's place in the popular imagination today.",Nathan Rabalais,Louisiana Folklore Society annual meeting,03/23/2019,,,,,Folklore Figures of French and Creole Louisiana: An American Pantheon?

The analysis focuses especially on the processes of household formation, tribute, and migration.  It shows that households were registered in censuses based on monogamous marriages and nuclear families.  Marriage was also a basis of the tribute system; native marriages were embedded both in the laws that regulated tribute and in the tribute amassment and collection practices within native communities.  Finally, the paper draws evidence from censuses and judicial cases to depict outmigration from native communities.  The evidence suggests that although long-term migrants sometimes left their nuclear families behind, more often they did not.

15996,RQ-50772-13,"In the course of a project to transcribe and translate the lyrics of central Javanese gamelan music, it became clear that something highly unusual was going on in the way some of the texts were being used. Indeed, the lyrics of a typical gendhing (gamelan piece) represent an extreme, among the world's vocal musics, of fragmentation and discontinuity. Moreover, many of the texts are difficult for the average listener to understand because of their heavy doses of archaic words and their subtle word play, made all the more incomprehensible by melisma, the surrounding thick instrumental texture, breaths taken mid word, and the aforementioned fragmentation. In traditional gendhings, it is usually impossible to summarize what the words are ""about"": not only are they not tied to the music—singers can choose whatever texts fit the appropriate poetic meter—but a huge proportion of them are only there for the sound or in order to set up a riddle. Santosa (2001:375), in his study of the role of gamelan music in certain villages of central Java, while emphasizing that competencies vary, says, ""[a]mong ‘ordinary audiences' texts can mean the rendering of syllables or even the ‘noise of vowels' because the ‘literal meanings' are not significant to some of them."" In other words, the audiences in question heard texts as absolute music, devoid of propositional or even semantic content. And yet, gamelan lyrics contain some of the most beautiful, evocative poetry in the Javanese language. The following questions arise: What role do these lyrics play? Why do singers emphasize correct pronunciation, if meaning is unimportant? Why are certain texts overwhelmingly favored over others?  Santosa. 2001.

16004,FEL-257990-18,"This paper analyzes British children's fiction and nonfiction from 1800 to 1860 about global trade and political economy, exploring early representations of economic justice in children's literature. I identify popular authors who engage children in ethical debates over what kind of economic activities are mutually beneficial for producers and consumers. Children's books by Maria Edgeworth and Jane Marcet (the ""mother of political economy"" who inspired Harriet Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy (1834)), and children's manufacturing tour books by Isaac Taylor (the brother of poets Jane and Ann Taylor) represent cooperation as the happy result of competition and the division of labor, using personal gifts and face-to-face conversation to humanize capitalist exchange. Concurrently, Robert Owen and the Cooperative Society developed radical education curricula for children that rejects capitalist competition, developing the principles behind the Fair Trade movement.  My research investigates these competing visions of cooperation using Marcet's Willy's Holidays (1836), with children's articles from Cooperative newspapers, obtained with research from the Nation Co-operative Archive in Manchester. I call particular attention to representations of global and local trade, and gender, class, and race in labor contexts. Scholars have previously assessed literature by Charles Dickens, Charlotte Tonna, Harriet Martineau, and Elizabeth Gaskell about industrialization and political economy. My approach, however, places children at the center of these ethical debates—as readers and consumers, but also as children who worked alongside adults to produce goods for trade.",Elizabeth Massa Hoiem,"Children’s Literature Association (ChLA), IUPUI &amp; IU East, Indianapolis, IN",06/14/19,,,,,"“Fair Trade for Children: Ethical Cooperation and Exchange in the Children’s Literature of Maria Edgeworth, Isaac Taylor, Jane Marcet, and the 19thC Cooperative Movement.”"

I also suggest that photogrammetrists should continue to activate the valuable eye-hand-mind pathways induced by traditional drawing, although they must make several deliberate choices in how they spend their time in order to do so. Overall, I am optimistic that the field of ancient architecture will blossom as it integrates an exceptionally powerful and potentially revolutionary new recording tool that allows researchers, on the one hand, to reassess to the original remains of an ancient building with immense speed and clarity, while on the other to rethink architecture at greater scale and with more creativity than could possibly be conceived just one decade ago.",Philip Sapirstein,"Parthenon2: Digital Approaches to Architectural Heritage, held at Vanderbilt University",3-29-2019,,,,,"The impact of photogrammetry on the study, analysis, and presentation of architecture"

Although commercial in nature, Japanese Imperial Army personnel were instrumental in its creation. It functioned as logistical backup to the initial military operations as Manchukuo expanded its boundaries in the years leading up to the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Its pilots were military trained. They flew scouting missions, brought supplies to battlefields, removed the wounded, developed aerial photography techniques, and ferried opium to finance military adventure. The company also promoted its commercial operation at a time when few civilians flew. Articles in the company's in house monthly magazine, Man Ko describe the experiences of the early days of flight. In doing so the entries reveal the concerns of those creating a new nation.

The students were to write biographies of obscure Maryland suffragists for possible inclusion in Women and Social Movements in the U.S., an online subscription resource. (The UMD Libraries subscribe.) Because the women concerned are obscure, such a task would have been virtually impossible until fairly recently, but the digitization of many primary sources has greatly increased the possibilities in this kind of research. The course presented an excellent opportunity for close collaboration with the Libraries. UMD librarians and curators held two sessions for the course. In the first, Eric Lindquist and Doug McElrath showed how digitized newspapers and digitized census records could be used to create surprisingly rich pictures of even the obscurest of suffragists.

16087,FT-265034-19,"Jemmy (James) LaRoche made his London theatrical debut at Lincoln's Inn Fields in late December 1695 in George Granville's The She-Gallants. Specializing in the theatrical music of John Eccles, LaRoche appeared in several entertainments, singing intricate lute ayres and duets. In late 1697, LaRoche was cast as an itinerant Savoyard in Peter Motteux and Eccles's Europe's revels for the Peace of Ryswick, in which he sings a simple and repetitive ballad-style tune whilst exhibiting a portable cabinet of moving figurines and curiosities. LaRoche's tune, ""Raree Show,"" is quite different from the previous songs assigned to him. Simplistic and limited in range, it approximates a street performance by an untrained musician—in other words, LaRoche was meant to sing badly.   After Europe's revels, evidence of LaRoche's performing career with Betterton disappears. While musicologists Katherine Lowerre and Amanda Eubanks Winkler have examined the contextual history of Europe's revels and Restoration theatrical music, little research exists on juvenile performers from this period and the circulation of their music.  Using performance studies as a theoretical frame, I examine the extant music written for LaRoche and the afterlife of his ""Raree Show"" tune. While musicology often privileges an ideal text or a perfectly rehearsed performance, it is vital to remember that failure was a hallmark of the seventeenth century soundscape and theatrical experience. By attending to evidence of ""bad singing"" and marginalized performers in early modern England, we can reconceive the networks of musical circulation, performance practices, and ""illegitimate"" theatrical spaces of seventeenth century London.",Sarah F Williams,American Musicological Society-Southeast Chapter,09/14/2019,,,,,“Sung by a Little Boy”: Bad Singing and the Rise and Fall of a Child Star in Seventeenth-Century English Theater
16099,HB-258040-18,"This paper examines Marita Bonner's Chicago stories that begin in 1933 with the serialized ""A Possible Triad of Black Notes"" and culminate with ""One True Love"" (1941). More specifically, I argue that Bonner's portrayals of Frye Street women upend narratives of domesticity and respectability that characterize New Negro women's literature. In this way, Bonner anticipates the transition to social realism that was embraced by Alain Locke and further promulgated by Richard Wright in his ""Blueprint for Negro Writers"" as well as his fiction. Wright, among other mostly male social realists, was preoccupied with how racism and class oppression impacted black men. Hence, social realist fiction often depicts the representative and ""authentic"" black urban subject as a proletarian male. However, Bonner's focus on black women workers broadens the ""narrow orbit"" Wright affords black northern women and privileges black women as urban subjects.

In my preliminary and exploratory interpretation of this rare and beautiful thing, I will address how we have characterized the experiences of enslaved black women through a reliance on slave narratives as our principle texts and raise questions about how our understanding might change and expand if we looked for and spent time with different kinds of textual testimony. My talk will explore what counts as text, how we might read the stories of enigmatic textual things, and how certain things – particularly textiles – are tactile carriers that prompt extraordinary transactions of emotion, meaning and memory.",Tiya Miles,,01/02/2019,,,,,"Textile as Text: New Ways of Reading the History of Black Women in Slavery, Presidential Plenary Panel, at the MLA Conference"

16129,HAA-261228-18,"While historical documents are common sources of digital humanities collections, many digital projects still do not use controlled terminologies to represent their content and aid search, discoverability, and use. There are often pragmatic reasons for this. The art of identifying appropriate descriptive terms is a valuable skill. Unfortunately, too few DH projects have access to information specialists who can index their documents for them. We are addressing these challenges with the Nineteenth-Century Knowledge Project, an ongoing initiative to create the first standards-compliant digital version of historical editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica. The sheer scale of the project precludes human indexing, because it would take an estimated six-to-eight years to read through all of the entries. Instead, we use an innovative method to add automatically generated content metadata using linked open terminologies and the HIVE-approach. This method has allowed us to experiment on the optimal controlled vocabulary to use for indexing historical documents. Our presentation will focus on the results of this experiment.","Logan, Peter Melville, Greenberg, Jane, Grabus, Samantha","Digital Humanities 2019, sponsored by the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations",7/11/2019,https://dev.clariah.nl/files/dh2019/boa/0889.html,Longer abstract in the Book of Abstracts produced for the conference.,,,"Knowledge Representation, History, and Historical Metadata"

16143,FT-265166-19,"As political scientists grapple with how to understand and explain the rise to power of self-identified populist movements around the globe, we argue that the role of conservative, religious, and/or non-feminist women—understudied in the field as a whole—becomes ever more critical as a lens to understand and explain how populist movements come to power. Much of the research on the politics of conservative, religious and/or non-feminist women has been pioneered outside the discipline of political science. We argue that gender scholars of political science—in particular those who are studying the role of women in populist movements—have much to contribute to our theoretical and empirical understanding of the rise, and the effects, of populism in global and domestic contexts. In fact, we would argue that these phenomena cannot be adequately understood or explained without attention to the role of women in such movements. To address this gap, this roundtable brings together scholars doing leading-edge research on issues of substantive representation of religious, conservative, and non-feminist women across a range of countries and regions, all of which have experienced the recent (within the last five years) electoral success of populist movements, and/or have grappled with right-wing populist political movements and discourses holding significant sway in their political landscapes.","Malliga Och, Rina Williams",American Political Science Association,8/31/19,,,,,Substantive Representation of Conservative Women: Crafting A Research Agenda
16144,FT-265166-19,"The alarming rise of conservative populist movements in democracies around the world raises critically important theoretical and policy questions for scholars of women and politics. Gender scholars have much to contribute to our theoretical and empirical understanding of these dynamics in both global and domestic contexts. Because the participation of women lends an air of legitimacy to such movements—and an air of empowerment to women—it is urgent to understand the role of women and gender in populist movements. The role of gender and elections in Asia remains underexplored as a lens through which to understand these global political trends.   In India, the growing participation of women in the BJP has correlated with increasing electoral success of the party. But as the descriptive representation of women in the party has grown over time, we do not know how if at all the party's stances on women's issues (substantive representation of women) have changed, and how they have aligned (or not aligned) with the priorities of feminist scholars and activists in India. A key part of the BJP's strategy to incorporate women involves challenging feminist claims to represent Indian women and their interests. This paper thus seeks to explore whether and how the descriptive representation of women in religious nationalist politics in India corresponds to changes in the substantive representation of women, and to feminist positions on the substantive representation of women. Have the BJP's stances on women's issues changed as women have become increasingly incorporated into the party? How do the BJP's positions on women's issues differ from or correspond to feminist positions?",Rina Williams,American Political Science Association,8/30/19,,,,,"Inconsistent Allies: Women’s Issues, Feminism and Religious Nationalism in India"

16190,HAA-255979-17,"Podcasting is just over ten years old as a media form and practice, but it has ushered in an explosion of amateur and professional cultural production. There are now over one million podcast feeds in over one hundred languages. There's a podcast on almost every subject imaginable, from popular shows like Serial and Radiolab to lighter fare like the wrestling podcast Wrestlespective or shows that cover a social issues like sexuality, identity, race or politics (e.g. Strange Fruit, This Week in Blackness, etc.). We are in the midst of what many are calling a ""Golden Age of Podcasts""; a moment where the choice for quality digital audio abounds, and where new voices and new listeners connect daily through earbuds, car stereos, or office computers. The audience keeps growing as well, exceeding 60 million American listeners last year.  Yet despite the excitement over this vital media form, and despite the plethora of content being produced, the sounds of podcasting's nascent history remain mystifyingly difficult to analyze. There are few resources for anyone interested in researching the form, content, or history of podcasts and even fewer tools for preserving and analyzing the sonic artifacts being produced during this golden age of audio. What today's podcasters are producing will have value in the future, not just for its content, but for what it tells us about audio's longer history, about who has the right to communicate and by what means. We may be in a ""Golden Age"" of podcasts but if we're not making efforts to preserve and analyze these resources now, we'll find ourselves in the same conundrum many radio, film or television historians find themselves: writing, researching and thinking about a past they can't fully see or hear.",Eric Hoyt,Association for Computers and the Humanities,06/23/2019,,,,,PodcastRE: Saving and Studying New Sounds.
16191,HAA-255979-17,"Podcasting's increasing popularity has resulted in a number of distribution platforms seeking to incorporate podcasting into their content offerings. While podcasting used to be largely delivered through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed subscriptions via software like iTunes or mobile apps like Overcast, digital content distributors like Spotify and Google have begun including podcasts as part of their streaming offerings. Some, like Spotify, have even commissioned original podcasts available exclusively on their platform. On the one hand, these seem like relatively innocuous business strategies; content providers want to provide listeners with popular audio content, so they add podcasts to their services. However, the inclusion of podcasts as part of streaming services that also include music, audiobooks, and other audio content represents a significant infrastructural shift for podcasting; a shift that may make it harder for lesser-known and niche podcasts to stand out in these spaces.   Using data from a large podcast database, PodcastRE (http://podcastre.org), this paper examines the role open technologies like RSS and XML play in creating a vibrant environment for audio and investigates the logics streaming services deploy for podcast display and discovery on their platforms. The Spotification of podcasting, I argue, may represent a welcome push towards more user-friendly and mainstream consumption of podcasts but, in the process, might threaten the very format these companies hope to popularize. In other words, podcasting may be more ubiquitous than ever but visibility may not equal diversity.",Jeremy Wade Morris,Society for Cinema and Media Studies,03/13/2019,,,,,The Spotification of Podcasting
16192,HAA-255979-17,"This paper documents one effort to save these new sounds: a database I have been building called PodcastRE (short for Podcast Research). Currently the site (http://podcaster.org) tracks over 1300 podcast feeds, and indexes and stores over 250,000 audio files, along with all the associated metadata from the RSS feeds. The web interface allows users to search the database via keyword (e.g. title, author, description elements, etc.). There are also several thousand interactive transcripts which allow users to find specific keywords within individual episodes (e.g. Election, ISIS, Hamilton, etc.) and narrow their search results accordingly.  The database raises a number of significant challenges regarding saving and researching digital audio. There's the incredible inconsistency of podcast metadata, which comes via both RSS feeds and the ID3 tags within the audio files themselves, both of which depend on which platform hosts the podcast and which program was used to created it. There's also the instability of the object itself…podcasts are no longer static audio files like they were in podcasting's early years. Technologies like dynamic advertising and dynamic insertion mean that the audio file itself can change periodically over time. Beyond these technical questions, there are the more serious cultural questions the database raises about what to save (which voices, which sounds) and how to go about doing so; it's easy to automate scraping the most popular podcasts but sourcing the more marginalized more independent shows is a much more manual affair.",Jeremy Wade Morris,Association of Internet Researchers,10/13/2018,,,,,PodcastRE: Archiving the Promises of a Disruptive Format

The challenges of both qualitative and quantitative audio analyses mean that sound remains far less usable than textual resources. Fortunately, podcasting creates new opportunities for archiving, discovering, and analyzing audio content. This paper reports on an on-going project I am developing, called PodcastRE (http://podcastre.org) to create a searchable, researchable database of podcasts for media studies and communications scholars interested in the practices, politics, and potentials of podcasting. This web-based database of podcasts currently allows researchers to conduct key word searches within over 250,000 podcasts at the feed and episode level. It allows for macro analyses of general characteristics (e.g. show length, producer affiliation, topic, date and other metadata) and will eventually include the ability to visualize search results. Given the lack of metadata standards for podcasts, the dynamic nature of audio files, and the ephemerality of expired links and RSS feeds, I argue podcasts are ubiquitous yet highly vulnerable cultural artifacts.

16208,FT-265568-19,"What does it mean to represent—visually and textually—a people who are unconvinced of their own agency and indeed humanity within the postcolonial world as they feel victimized by ensuing civil wars and political unrest in their nations? In this paper, I focus on Amir and Khalil's Zahra's Paradise and Hamid Sulaiman's Freedom Hospital, two graphic novels set in Iran and Syria respectively, each addressing a range of issues related to human rights—from free speech to the policing of values and morality under theocratic and/or totalitarian regimes, from torture to state-sanctioned murder. Focusing on the disappearance of a protestor after the fraudulent elections of 2009, Zahra's Paradise follows one mother's quest for justice. This emblematic story, weaving fact with fiction, illustrates the chaotic environment in which the Green Revolution has led to a ""major purge of reform-oriented individuals"" by the authoritarian state, using Islam as a façade to legitimize its power. As one reviewer puts it, as Zahra moves from hospital to courtroom to prison to cemetery, she is ""confronted with doublespeak worthy of Orwell and confounded by a labyrinthine bureaucratic nightmare worthy of Kafka."" Freedom Hospital also features a woman, Yasmine, who navigates between different militarized fractions fighting for the control of her town as she tries to build a hospital. The war-torn territory forms the backdrop of panels that feature faceless, nameless figures – casualties of war – scattered across the pages. Suleiman also makes a point of giving a count of the dead on each passing day before he embarks on a new story line. Both works focus on people trapped in a state of exception, attempting to work out how to respond to their chaotic environment as humans—even when their positive rights are violated so severely that, in Hannah Arendt's words, they face ""expulsion from humanity altogether.""",Esra Santesso,Postcolonial Studies Association Conference,09/12/2019,,,,,"“Human Rights: Witnessing in the Islamic Graphic Novel"""

Hamdy's Lissa sheds light on the Egyptian uprisings against government corruption by focusing on the friendship between an American and Egyptian girl. In Freedom Hospital, Sulaiman takes the reader through the contested territories of the Syrian revolution as various military operations create an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Cultural translation remain at the heart of both works as they explore how to communicate and thus educate the ""West"" about the banality of violence, as marked, for example, by the number of dead on each page in Freedom Hospital. The suspension of law and therefore the transformation of the citizen to bare life not only point to the collective traumatic experienced by those who remain trapped within repressive regimes, but also show the futility of human rights discourse in war-ridden territories.

The hypothesis at play is that Secoya has a single but complex classification system. The data examined here suggests that the language has concurring subsystems that complement each other, in the sense of Gomez-Imbert (2007), Seifart and Payne (2007), and Fedden and Corbett (2017). Secoya, as many other languages in the world, has formal mechanisms to organize nominal referents following three semantic parameters: animacy, biological sex, and shape. Animacy, refers to the degree to which entities are capable of human-like volition behavior (Silverstein 1976). Gender is a complex socio-culturally constructed classification on the basis of biological differences between males and females (McConnell-Ginet 1988). Shape includes dimensionality, axial geometry, curved/straight edges, negative spaces, and orientated axis, properties that play a crucial role in object recognition, visual processing, and language acquisition (Seifart 2005). In Secoya, these three semantic parameters have ramifications in grammatical subsystems.

872,FT-52641-04,"John Chrysostom's Exegetical Homilies on the Gospel of John were translated into Syriac in the fifth century and enjoyed great popularity in Syriac-speaking churches. As instances of cross-cultural reception and recontextualization, they put the voice of the Golden Mouth into an oriental idiom, drawing him into various conversations that were fundamental to the development of the Syriac heritage. His impact on that heritage is signalled by the number of Syriac manuscripts containing the Homilies, the controversy alleged to have surrounded his exegetical legacy in the Syriac Church of the East (i.e. ""Nestorians""), and his continuing Nachleben in the broader Syriac interpretive, ascetic, and liturgical traditions. The Homilies are saturated with biblical citation and exposition, supplying early evidence pertinent to the rich Syriac biblical tradition and illuminating the ways in which Greek Antiochene exegesis was being appropriated into oriental Christian communities. The Syriac Homilies have even been heralded as a principal source of evidence for a pre-canonical form of the Greek text of John's Gospel.  Despite the remarkable age and inherent richness of the texts, only preliminary studies have been done so far. Indeed, it has only recently become possible to gain access to portions of the extant Syriac evidence in Damascus, and due to recent work, it has also now become possible to identify previously unknown manuscripts and fragments containing portions of the text and to ""reunite"" formerly separated portions of important early evidence from Sinai that had been scattered across Europe. This paper briefly presents the results of a thorough analysis of these texts, including those having recently come to light, in order to clarify their significance as early evidence for Chrysostom's Homilies and for multiple avenues of other research across a wide range of interests in Greek and Syriac patristics.",Jeff Childers,"XVI International Conference on Patristic Studies, Oxford",08/11/2011,http://oxfordpatristics.blogspot.com/2011/06/jeff-childers-chrysostom-in-syriac.html,,,,Chrysostom in Syriac Dress
873,FT-52641-04,"Religious World of Late Antiquity, Word as Object: The centrality of scripture in early Syriac Christian tradition is obvious. Less well-understood are the methods by which the power of scripture was brought to bear on the ordinary lives of common Christian folk, outside the official contexts of liturgical practice. A unique early Syriac manuscript of John's Gospel supplies a glimpse into the practices of specialized interpreters who sought mystical guidance in the Bible according to methods that were often considered illicit. The manuscript includes an apparatus unlike that of any known collection of sortes, incorporated directly into the biblical text. In response to specific questions, the volume offers inspired words of guidance to the inquirer in a process superintended by clergy who were considered unconventional. Although its true function was effectively disguised by means of a spurious scribal association with Chrysostom's Commentary on John, this paper makes evident the true nature of the volume as a biblical text interspersed throughout a magical framework. That the practice of consulting Bibles in such a manner was fairly widespread and long-lived is evident both from the repeated canonical attempts to suppress the practice and from the fragmentary, often vestigial testimony in the Greek, Latin, Armenian, Georgian, and Syriac biblical traditions. The proposed paper will present a summary of the unique evidence of the Syriac manuscript and compare it to other pertinent evidence. The study focuses interest on the text as an expression of popular faith in scripture's authority and as evidence for a particular mode of Christian interpretation, one that seeks to establish dynamic connections between the biblical text and the daily lives of common folk within a sophisticated context of clerical practice, institutional prohibition, and widespread popular use.",Jeff Childers,Society of Biblical Literature Annual Conference,11/20/2011,,,,,Hermeneutics and Magic: Syriac Biblical Manuscripts as Oracles of Interpretation

884,FT-54231-06,"The lance of St. Maurice was a real weapon; it was also an imperial insigne visible in coin, seal, and miniature portraits of the Saxon emperors.  This spear, in whose blade was embedded a nail from Christ's Crucifixion, was believed to have been carried by the third-century martyr particularly venerated in the Middle Ages for his stand against paganism; legend also associated it with Constantine.  Otto I (r. 936-973) defended an internal assault on his authority while bearing the lance at the Battle of Birten in 939, and scholarship to date has emphasized the role of the lance in the assertion of legitimate kingship.  However, Otto also carried the spear during his rout of the pagan Hungarians at the Battle of the Lech in 955.  In this paper, I place the lance and representations of it in the context of the Ottonian campaign to subjugate and convert to Christianity the Slavs and Hungarians whose agitative presence along the Elbe River had long been a concern for western rulers.  I view the lance and related images as one facet of a military-missionary strategy, developed initially by Otto I and carried forward by his successors, that employed visual and symbolic means in addition to strong-arm tactics to prosecute its cause.  The importance to Otto of the lance and the soldier-saint who first carried it was evident by 937, when the newly crowned German king founded and dedicated to St. Maurice a monastery at Magdeburg on the Elbe.  Magdeburg, elevated in 968 to an archbishopric, was conceived by Otto as the primary locus of representation of Holy Roman Imperial authority, with its intertwined secular and sacred dimensions.  I thus place the lance in the Magdeburg context, discussing surviving elements from the Ottonian cathedral that likewise suggest a visual strategy in the proselytizing expansionism of the Ottonian rulers.",Karen Blough,"Forty-Second Annual International Conference on Medieval Studies, ",5/13/2007,,,,,A Double-Edged Blade:  The Reality and Symbolism of the Lance of St. Maurice

As my analysis aims to show, Magris's creative production hence authenticates a theoretical reflection on the significance of ‘home' for identitarian, linguistic, and political purposes that also reconceptualizes Europe as geographical and temporal lodging and dislodgement.",Nicoletta Pireddu,Europe in Its Own Eyes/Europe in the Eyes of the Other,10/02/2010,,,,,"""Temporary Housing: Claudio Magris's Europeanness"""

994,FA-52436-06,"The destiny of democracy in Europe is being discussed from multiple perspectives. However, very little attention has been devoted so far to literature as an expressive form able not only to reelaborate creatively the main issues of the process of Europeanization but also to contribute to the very formation of the debate on European questions, anticipating positions that take shape only later in other disciplines. &#x0D; My paper intends to examine the modalities with which the notion of democracy intervenes in the many literary transfigurations of the idea of Europe. Through the discussion of essays and novels representative of an explicitly European AND democratic consciousness, I linger on the ideological, political, cultural and linguistic implications of such a connection, highlighting potentialities and problems.&#x0D; From the Europeanist idylss of Denis De Rougemont, to Stefan Zweig's ""Europe of yesterday"", from Diego Marani's ""europanto"" to the pseudo-Europeanization of Ben Jelloun's migrants, from Claudio Magris's anti-globalization Europe to Tim Parks's ""euro-scepticism"", I emphasize how, in the realm of imagination, to think and rethink Europe means, above all, to think and rethink democracy inside and outside its mobile boundaries, laying bare its aporiae. The literature of Europe plays an ethical role. It monitors and denounces the inconsistencies and hypcrisies of the connection between Europe and democracy. &#x0D; In my essay, the literary thematization of the European question provides the context to analyze the role of the narrative dimension in the critique of democracy. Narrating Europe, writing constructs and deconstructs, in the Derridian sense, its democratic ambitions. It reduces the exportability of concepts and values upon which its alleged ""society of citizens"" is founded or should be founded, and warns against inauthentic egalitarianism and ""political correctness"".",Nicoletta Pireddu,Il destino della democrazia.

1012,FB-51501-05,"Although ethnomusicologists and dance scholars have long been interested in the ways that culture is transmitted, which involves processes of learning and creativity, related studies are a recent development in both fields.  One such learning/creative process that remains to be researched in depth is dance/music improvisation (Hayes 2003; Nettl 2005).  Analysis of how dance is improvised to improvised musical accompaniment, for example, can contribute towards the understanding of these processes and show how music and dance come together--another topic worthy of research (Hanna 1992).  In this paper, I discuss Argentine malambo, the lone solo dance in the country's folklore repertoire, which is performed to improvised accompaniment.  Danced only by men, associated with the virile gaucho and Argentine identity/tradition, and done in both northern and southern styles, malambo survives mostly in formal competitions at which prizes are awarded to either solo dancers—who execute semi-improvised steps and foot tapping--or to choreographed groups of performers.  In my presentation, I draw on scholarly work, dance manuals, competition guidelines, and an interview with a malambo champion to explain how malambo ""moves"" are learned by imitation and practice and later developed individually using ""flow"" (inside/outside world sensations, memory, and intentionality) and personal ability (De Spain 2003).  I also discuss the improvised guitar/drum accompaniment associated with both malambo styles, use video footage to show how dance and music come/fit together in live performances, and address how malambo is judged at the Pre-Cosquín Competition for amateur talent.",Jane L.

1013,FB-51501-05,"Desde el momento que el antropólogo Alan P. Merriam escribió sobre la importancia de la enseñanza y el aprendizaje musical en la cultura, los etnomusicólogos han estudiado estos procesos para entender los sistemas musicales y cómo se transmiten/se cambian.  Aunque ya existen publicaciones dedicadas a algunas de las maneras formales e informales de aprender música en EE.UU. y otros paises (e.g., en los conservatorios y en el jazz), queda mucho por hacer--especialmente con la música popular--en Latinoamérica.  En el caso de la Argentina, ya hay algunos trabajos académicos escritos sobre la enseñanza formal de la música popular; sin embargo, no se ha investigado mucho todavía el aprendizaje semi-formal/informal del folklore musical--un tema fundamental porque el estudio formal del folklore no está al alcance de todos.  Una vía semi-formal muy común de aprender el género allá es participar de las oportunidades ofrecidas por la Comisión Municipal de Folklore de Cosquín:  el Certamen Pre-Cosquín, el Festival Nacional de Folklore (los espectáculos callejeros, las peñas, etc.), el Festival de la Canción y el Cosquín de Peñas.

1015,FB-51501-05,"Much has been written in the international media about Argentina's ""Dirty War"" (1976-1983), a time when the country's military junta and leaders attempted to wipe out leftist guerillas, ""subversives,"" and political activists thought to be dangerous. Human rights abuses (e.g., ""disappearances,"" torture, and murder), the trial and eventual pardon of those in power, and the weekly marches of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo have all been widely covered.  Repressive measures began as early as 1973, when ex-President Juan Perón returned to the country from exile, and continued during the rule of his wife Isabel (1974-1976).  Much less has been written about either the short or long term influence of this period on musical genres and festivals in Argentina, some of which were censored, regulated, and/or banned.

Drawing on information gathered from archives, the MFC, and singers/ensembles involved, I address issues such as Festival intervention in 1974, attempted Festival cancellation in 1975, imprisonment of MFC organizers, government edicts passed regarding Festival production, censorship of song lyrics, blacklisted artists, and persecution/exile/death of performers.

1132,FT-52626-04,"This paper examines the various incarnations of Orson Welles' unfinished Brazilian project, It's All True, a pseudo-documentary that studied racial and class politics manifest in the cultural ritual of Carnival.  It's All True represents the furthest step in a concept Welles had been exploring for some time: documentary fiction.  His merger of politics and fiction while filming, however, resulted in the tragic drowning of a Brazilian national hero.  His film, too, became submerged in studio reluctance and red-tape, and parts of it were literally thrown into the ocean ",Marguerite H.

1135,FT-52626-04,"In 1937, Orson Welles was a respected young performer/director associated primarily with the New York theater.  By December of 1938, he had secured one of the most lucrative film contracts ever granted to a young writer, director and actor from RKO studios in Hollywood.  During this single year, Welles devoted himself primarily to radio performance, developing his radio series First Person Singular, later to become sponsored by Campbell's Soup and retitled Mercury Theater on the Air.  Two concepts were central to this radio series: first-person narration, and adaptation of classic literature.  Welles excelled at a performance style that positioned his voice as the conduit for adaptation, a recognizable guide for the listener through a literary experience deemed ""classic"" by its association with Welles.  The first-person approach placed Welles in the school of American star directors, or auteurs, but his consistent interest in the adaptation of literature written by others troubles the concept of auteurism, which often demands that the director be seen as a primary author of the text.  Studying Welles's radio plays as they relate to his cinema projects suggests that one of our most famous film directors was deeply indebted to radio for his unconventional notions of ""text,"" ""author,"" and ""audience.""  Welles's genius was one of cultural adaptation and media manipulation, twin strategies which he articulated through a first-person narrator. ",Marguerite H.

1137,FT-52626-04,"Orson Welles's exploration of the line between fact and fiction, most famously exhibited in his 1938 Halloween War of the Worlds broadcast left two very different entertainment legacies.  First, the broadcast offered a template for how to forge collective American identity through media-projected fear.  But the broadcast had a secondary impact as well—to help foster an emerging distrust of broadcast media itself.  Radio in 1938 occupied a similar rhetorical spaces to that of television today in the American imagination.  Both act as media sources that Americans turn to for reliable, real-time information about the world outside their homes, but these media sources are sources of both tricks and treats for the American public. Increasingly, misleading the American public by media manipulation, which was regarded as dangerous and transgressive in Welles' era, has become a common political strategy.   This paper will suggest that Welles' experimentation with the line between fact and fiction—a theme often explored in his cinema work-- originated in radio broadcast and reflects a postmodern concept of erosions of the ""real.""   In an era of seemingly unbelievable political events, it appears the entertainment values hyperbolically matched social values.  That is to say, Welles became adept at representing the disorienting state of modern consciousness as it evolved toward postmodern disorientation.  His characters often represent the inability to construct any single ""truth"" when it comes to personal or public history.  ",Marguerite H.

1139,FT-52626-04,"Before there was Citizen Kane, there was Orson Welles the radio persona, the creative director and star of the show Mercury Theatre on the Air, which gave us the infamous War of the Worlds Halloween broadcast, and which also left behind many more radio adaptations of famous texts. Each of these radio broadcasts offers significant insight into Welles' emerging adaptation strategies, as well as his methods of negotiating between commercial sponsors, audience expectations, and his own creative expression, all of which are key to understanding his emerging cinematic style. This paper studies the controversy over a 1939 Orson Welles radio broadcast of ""Liliom,"" the Molnar tale that formed the basis of the later musical adaptation, Carousel.  The Liliom controversy lasted from August to November of 1939, during which time Welles had to defend his creative freedom against attempts at censorship by religious organizations and commercial sponsors. The controversy centered on representations of scenes of heaven and the afterlife, and Welles felt frustrated and yet intrigued by the challenge of bringing it to broadcast—enough so that it influenced an initial proposal for a film about the Life of Christ to RKO. The ""Liliom"" controversy tells us much about the process of generating mass entertainment in this era, and the role that commercial sponsors, religious organizations, and the media played in the creation of Welles' creative vision.  The controversy also illuminates what was not deemed controversial at the time--namely the graphic depiction of domestic violence.  ",Marguerite H.

It uses these documents to explore a number of issues in relation to Datini's involvement with trade of materials for artists including:  how would Tuscan merchants such as Datini have viewed these goods?  To which cities would he have turned for their supply?  What might they tell us about overall networks during the period?

It looks at the distributional properties of the classification devices with a focus on the semantic distinctions they encode, as wells as their functions in discourse. The data examined here suggests that the language has concurrent subsystems that complement each other (Gomez-Imbert 2007; Seifart &amp; Payne 2007; Fedden &amp; Corbett 2017). Secoya has formal mechanisms to organize nominal referents following three semantic parameters: animacy, biological sex, and shape. Animacy, refers to the degree to which entities are capable of human-like volition behavior (Silverstein 1976). Gender is a complex socio-culturally constructed classification on the basis of biological differences between males and females (McConnell-Ginet 1988). Shape includes dimensionality, axial geometry, curved/straight edges, negative spaces, and orientated axis, properties that play a crucial role in object recognition, visual processing, and language acquisition (Seifart 2005). In Secoya, these three semantic parameters have ramifications in grammatical subsystems.

16220,FN-260675-18,"Languages throughout the world have dedicated mechanisms to specify information about the shape, animacy, consistency, size, location, or utility of the entities around us. An important question in linguistics is to what extent the nominal classification system of a language mirrors the way speakers see the world they live in, and to what extent the documented similarities reflect underlying, general cognitive processes in the human mind. Thus, an adequate theory of human language requires a broad sampling of diverse languages. Amazonian languages have been identified as a priority in this respect, since they are both poorly documented and highly endangered. This project investigates Secoya, an endangered Tukanoan language spoken in Peruvian Amazonia, and provides new bodies of data from unique settings. The concrete outcome will be a morphosyntactic and semantic account of Secoya's nominal classification system, situating the analysis in the broader Amazonian context. From a theoretical perspective, Secoya provides an excellent case scenario to test current typologies of nominal classification. There has been a traditional belief that the classification of entities can be achieved by either gender systems or classifier systems. Secoya has both gender and classifiers. This project will contribute to the development of a framework in which both systems can be analyzed together. Also, a better understanding of Secoya can shed light on language contact in Amazonia. Secoya is one of the few languages of the Tukanoan family that is outside of the well-known Vaupes linguistic area where several contact-induced processes are taking place. Secoya is particularly important to inform debates regarding the direction of influence among systems. More broadly, this project contributes to the documentation of imperiled cultural heritage, while also enriching our understanding of the diversity of the world's languages.",Rosa Vallejos,Collegium de Lyon Seminar,3/18/2019,https://collegium.universite-lyon.fr/rosa-vallejos-the-role-of-shape-and-animacy-in-nominal-classification-evidence-from-the-amazon-84314.kjsp?RH=1522927788210,Collegium de Lyon,,Collegium de Lyon Seminar,The role of shape and animacy in categorization: evidence from the Amazon
16222,HAA-261070-18,"Bioethicists and humanistic researchers alike have long been concerned over the effects of unchecked industry money on biomedical cultures. Corporate-funded clinical trials, free lunches, free travel, and industry honoraria for scientists have been shown to adversely affect the integrity of biomedical research. Despite the broad recognition of these hazards, efforts to address them have largely been limited to disclosure requirements and related training. Current standards require clinical researchers to report certain conflicts of interest alongside published scholarship. Unfortunately, a growing body of evidence indicates that disclosure statements often result in unintended and pernicious effects. Ultimately, a significant shift in our understanding of conflicts of interest is required, and this is where the insights of digital humanities (DH) can be most beneficial. However, in order for this kind of theoretically-informed relational network modeling to be of use to humanities research, scholars need effective and efficient tools to transform the dense prose of disclosure statements, financial reports, or database outputs into useable visualizations. This is precisely what the Transparency to Visualization (T2V) tool is designed to do. Our toolkit combines natural language processing, machine-learning enhanced named-entity recognition, and regular expressions to create a script that ""reads"" biomedical disclosure statements for economic relationships and prepares extracted data for subsequent visualization.

16233,FO-258291-18,"The mottled landscape of pastoral and agrarian livelihoods in Inner Mongolia posed fundamental problems around governance for Japanese imperialists after they invaded Northeast China in 1931. Within this zone of mixed settlement, Japanese planners and Mongol collaborators pursued land reform to mark out a new border for an autonomous province within the client state of Manchukuo. The border continues to define the eastern limits of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to this day. This paper details the origins, implementation, and consequences of this reform, a law known as ""The Mongol Land Offer,"" which expropriated the estates of indigenous princes beyond the new border and incorporated these territories into Manchukuo's county administration in 1938. Driven by Marxian analysis, Japanese researchers from the South Manchuria Railway Company reframed the nomadic pastoralism practiced by Mongols within feudalism in order to justify state dispossession of aristocratic property beyond the border. The Land Offer redistributed the extensive holdings of the Mongol nobility to predominantly Chinese tenants. Japanese leftists reworked Marxian theory to recognize the Mongol territories as a special case of feudalism, where not only class, but also livelihood lay as the cause of supposed economic stagnation. The data from Japanese surveys, generated in collaboration with indigenous partners, motivated land reform in the Mongol territories that predated Communist programs. This extensive classification project led to significant territorial dispossession, the curtailing of indigenous power, and ultimately the effacement of Mongol identity from the map of Northeast China.",Sakura Christmas,"Annual Meeting of the American Historical Association, Chicago IL",01/05/2019,https://aha.confex.com/aha/2019/webprogram/Paper25917.html,Online Conference Program of the 2019 Annual Meeting of the American Historical Association,,,Imperial Japan and Land Reform in the Mongol Territories of Manchukuo

Indigenous leaders convinced Manchukuo authorities to ban further land reclamation on the steppe as way to ""revive the Mongol race"" through nomadic practice. The Five Year Plan of 1936, however, sought to eliminate the nomadic aspect of herding because its Japanese architects did not see seasonal migration as a ""rational"" use of resources. Rather, they viewed it as the root of overgrazing and land degradation on the steppe. These sweeping claims by the imperial state did the political work of motivating grassland protection policies to rearrange the livelihoods of herders. Casting native species as ""degenerate,"" Japanese experimental farms began importing alfalfa seeds and Merino sheep whose intensive care required sedentary patterns of subsistence, subverting nomadic practice over time. The Japanese program to turn so-called primitive nomads into rationalized ranchers settled Mongols into ethnic enclaves, known as ""concentration-villages,"" to produce meat, wool, and leather in industrial quantities for the empire. While the steppe would continue to look like the steppe, the Five Year Plan refigured an underlying ecology of transhumance into one of sedentary extraction.

16256,FT-265510-19,"The 1857 New York edition of the popular Ursuline Manual discouraged novel reading and plays as a ""stumbling-block to [young women's] piety,"" yet in the last decades of the nineteenth century, a significant literary output, in the forms of short fiction and drama, were created by American teaching sisters for their female pupils. The origins of this paper lie in a seemingly simple question: how can the study of Catholic women religious help us research nineteenth century American Catholic childhoods? While scholars of Catholicism and education in U.S. have often focused on the ""bible wars"" of the 1830s and 1840s, as a historian of women and girls I have turned my gaze away from the fraught public school and towards the convent school and Catholic bookstore, sites where middle-class American Catholicism was made and re-made during a century of vast growth. If a growing mass market for English-language devotional books changed the way that nineteenth-century American Catholic laypeople thought about their place in a Catholic world full of saints and Sacred Hearts, sacraments and miracles, further analysis of the pages in which devotional materials were advertised makes clear that young Catholic readers encountered more than simply spiritual guidance on the page, but also texts that could forge multiple identities: fiction and nonfiction, magazines, reading guides, and children's literature. Based on convent school plays (published by the Catholic Publication Society and other New York firms) this paper explores the impact of the ""sister-writer"" and her oeuvre, performed and read in female academies during the last decades of the nineteenth century.",Monica L.

16257,RA-50126-14,"Along with uniting for and engaging in the overt politics of Samyukta Maharashtra Movement (United Maharashtra Movement in Western India of the 1950-60s), many women and men equally engaged in and pursued the interlocking discourse of constructing their own regional identity, sexual modernity, morality, civility, and legitimacy. What was the language and paradigms that Marathi elites used in their articulation of what it meant to be Marathi, scientific, progressive, scientific, rational, and modern? Why was it so significant? In order to prove that they were now fit to govern themselves in independent India and Maharashtra, Maharashtrians articulated the vernacular political discourse of shuddha (pure, sanitized), naitik (moral), samajik (social), laingik (sexual), and sanskrutik (cultural) contours of what it meant to be a new brand of shilvan (genuine, of good disposition) Marathi manusa. In so doing, they once again attacked ashlilta (vulgarity) and critically carved out their moral modernity in order to be legitimate Marathi.

16425,RZ-51672-14,"The study of Amarna's non-elite cemeteries provides an extraordinary opportunity to explore the social dimensions of ancient Akhetaten. While there is generally little variation in approach to burial across individual graves, at a broader level – between cemeteries, with respect of natural and urban landscapes, and with communities in mind – there exists considerable potential for social analysis. Six cemeteries for the general population of Akhetaten are known: huge ‘public' cemeteries and smaller ‘community' burial grounds co-existed, and varied in their relationships to landscape and to living communities, and subtle differences in approach to burial can be seen across them. One remarkable burial ground near the North Tombs contains up to 5,000 individuals, most under the age of c. 25, who were perhaps from labourers' communities, living separately. If so, they represent a portion of Egyptian society largely unattested archaeologically at Amarna or elsewhere: a hidden urban community. This paper forms part of an ongoing exercise in repositioning the Amarna cemeteries within their lived urban landscape. It will explore how cemetery research helps to make Amarna's urban communities visible, and the tensions between ‘the city' and the communities that served it.",Anna Stevens,British Museum Annual Egyptological Colloquium: Amarna - The Lived City,9.19.19,,,,,"City, Cemetery and Community at Amarna"

In recent scholarship by Emma Tarlo and Annelies Moorson Islamic dress,""fashion"" speaks exclusively of women's clothing. They emphasize the  connection between aesthetics  and  ethics,  a  useful  theoretical reminder for this essay about men's caps. It discusses caps in general, and in specific will trace a single  distinctive  cap—the  one  that  I  wear  as  a  legacy  from my  Sufi  teacher  in  India,  a  cap  of simple design but complex symbolism. A Sufi cap does not merely display its wearer's allegiance to others. It also reminds its wearer—by the very pressure of its matter against his forehead—of the ideals of the Order to which he took vows.  These ideals are easily neglected because they urge one to forget oneself: the process of being reminded, whether by one's clothing or other skillful means, is the essence of dhikr, remembering God and thus being reminded of the nothingness of one's own mind. Purifying one's heart of the pollution of egoistic mind is grueling and difficult, and progress along its path is marked by backsliding as much as progress. Without love, there is little hope for success,for only passionately love can push us toward effacement. For this reason, the Chishti Sufis celebrate the cap that is awry, raised like a dome, peaked like a goal, cornered like a system, but tilted to show deference to beauty and love within the material constraints of this embodied world.",Scott Kugle,"Islam, Objects &amp; Everyday Life",12/06/2019,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D RNLxTXmo37vQIckpBhV46-s QO tW-OhwlR5hRATM/edit,conference web site,https://islamicstudies.stanford.edu/conferences/islam-objects-and-everyday-life,conference web site,"Caps, Heads and Hearts"

The Amarna Cemeteries project is a long-term, interdisciplinary project that seeks to utilize multiple lines of investigation to more fully understand the lives of the non-elite individuals buried in five cemeteries identified thus far.  To date, human skeletal remains have been analyzed from two of these cemeteries, the South Tombs Cemetery (STC; n=430; excavated 2005-2013) and the North Tombs Cemetery (NTC; n=194, excavated 2015-2017).  The two cemeteries differ in general demographic characteristic.  The STC reflects a normal ancient burial population, with representation of all age and sex groups in frequencies typical for bioarchaeological samples.  The NTC demography is much more restricted, with the vast majority of the individuals being young, 7-25 years old, and predominantly female.  Both of the cemeteries, however, reveal urban life was extremely difficult for the non-elite residents of Akhetaten.  Overwhelmingly, the skeletal remains show evidence of heavy workloads beginning early in life, dietary deficiency, and high frequency of infectious disease.  The cemetery profiles do not reflect the often speculated epidemic disease.","Dabbs, Gretchen R",British Museum Egyptology Colloquium,09/19/19,https://www.britishmuseum.org/our-work/departments/egypt-and-sudan/egyptological-lectures-and-colloquia,British Museum website,,,The Experience of Urban Life as told through Human Skeletal Remains: The bioarchaeology of Amarna’s non-elite cemeteries.
16464,RZ-51672-14,"The North Tombs Cemetery (NTC; excavated 2015-2017) at Tell el-Amarna sits in a wadi along the northeast margin of the cliffs surrounding the ancient capital city of Akhetaten and was in use during the brief Amarna Period (c. 1349-1332 BCE).  Initial expectations were that this cemetery would be similar to the previously studied South Tombs Cemetery (STC), reflecting the larger population of the city.  The STC has demonstrated heavy workloads, poor nutrition, and rampant infectious disease were common for the non-elite at Akhetaten. Ongoing bioarchaeological analysis of the NTC (current n=194) subverts initial expectations and suggests a specialized, restricted labor force of young, predominantly female individuals.  94% of the sample is estimated to be 7-25 years old and adult females outnumber adult males by a margin of 3.5:1.  This young workers' cemetery reflects heavy labor very early in life and potentially more intensively than present in the STC.  Pathological lesions identified in the NTC include degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the spine (8%) and limb joints (15%), fractures of the spine (31%), evidence of nutritional deficiency (53%), and infectious disease (94%).  Comparisons between the rates of trauma suggest the NTC subadults experienced up to eight times more fractures than STC counterparts, with the youngest spinal compression fractures occurring as early as six years old.  The presence of spinal and limb DJD in individuals as young as 12 years old lends further support to the interpretation of the NTC as a specialized, highly biologically taxed workforce.","Dabbs, Gretchen R",Bioarchaeology of Ancient Egypt,01/14/19,https://www.bae2019.org/,conference website,,,Even more unexpected results from a capital city: Preliminary results from the North Tombs Cemetery at Tell el-Amarna.

16471,RQ-260871-18,"Understanding significant gospel, spirituals, and shape-note music songbooks from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries involves looking beyond text and music to paratextual elements ranging from music notation system to format and page dimension to evidence of use that are important markers of these works' cultural context. Yet most recent approaches to digital music editions, and digital editions generally, erase these markers of bibliographic form, centering new digital renderings of encoded music and text in the user's browsing experience. In this paper, I discuss the NEH-funded forthcoming series of digital critical editions of vernacular sacred American music books from 1850–1925, Sounding Spirit, which employs Readux, a new platform for annotating and publishing digital scholarly editions developed by Emory's Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS), which emphasizes books' bibliographic forms in their digital expression. Readux is a Django/Python application that builds on the Mirador image viewer and IIIF protocol to augment annotated digitized books with transparently rendered text in a seamless digital interface. By retaining bibliographical forms in digital (music) editions, new critical editions can better subject to analysis technologies of print that meaningfully express these works' contexts before and after the turn of the twentieth century, a time of great dramatic demographic and cultural change that shaped intersections of race, religion, region, and music in the United States. This presentation articulates the value of an approach to digital editions that centers cultural paratext through augmented facsimile and describes the Readux platform that enables Sounding Spirit to adopt this approach to digital critical editing.",Jesse P.

16473,PW-234762-16,"Lithic data have received sparse attention in research on the Franciscan missions of Spanish La Florida. We have attempted to correct this imbalance through our ongoing digital database project Cataloguing the Franciscan Missions of La Florida. This project involves a re-analysis of all of the collections (lithic and otherwise) from three seventeenth-century interior missions. Our study emphasizes the variability in tools and their manufacture both within and between mission communities. The research reveals that Timucuan Native Americans continued to rely on a diverse lithic technological tradition well after arrival of friars in their communities and the subsequent importation of metal tools. This persistence is also reflected in historical accounts where, for example, Native Americans were mandated to maintain quotas of arrows. Formal stone tool systems are manifested in the manufacture of bifacial projectile points and the unusual occurrence of a prismatic blade technology. A wide range of expedient flake tools was also an important component of the household. In addition to characterizing the lithic technologies on the sites, our presentation addresses the methodological challenges of developing an approach toward debitage analysis that allows for consistency between researchers with only modest experience in the study of lithic materials.","Charles Cobb, Gifford Waters",11th International Symposium on Knappable Materials,11/9/2017,,,,,Lithic Technology at the Franciscan Missions of La Florida

16484,RQ-260760-18,"In 1897, Franz Boas published what became one of the most influential books in the field of anthropology: The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians. The collaborative product of Boas's own observations and extensive materials authored by his long-time Indigenous co-worker George Hunt, the text was the first systematic attempt to document all sociocultural, spiritual, and aesthetic aspects of a spectacular Native North American ceremonial structure.  This session presents the work of a collaborative project between scholars, Kwakwa_ka_'wakw researchers, the U'mista Cultural Centre, and international repositories to create a new critical edition of this founding document in anthropology.  The goal of the project is to examine the book's hidden histories and complex legacies in order to re-envision Kwakwa_ka_'wakw participation in the original research, to reassemble globally distributed collections and fragmented archives, and to create a critical historiography of the book. While clearly articulating the historical and political contexts for early anthropology, we are also recuperating long-dormant ethnographic records for use by the Indigenous families whose patrimony is represented in them. Academic and community team members will discuss Boas and Hunt's main sites for conducting ""fieldwork"" (communities in British Columbia, the Chicago World's Fair, and museums in North America and Europe); the primary media they utilized (museum objects, texts, photographs, and wax cylinder recordings); the conditions of, and the specific participants in, their research; and the legacy and contemporary use of the 1897 book in Kwakwa_ka_'wakw communities.","Aaron Glass, Judith Berman, Rainer Hatoum, Ira Jacknis, Andy Everson",American Anthropological Association/Canadian Anthropological Society,10/22/19,,,,,"Re-assembling The Social Organization: Franz Boas, George Hunt, and the Changing Climates of Collaborative Ethnography in British Columbia."

1334,HD-51244-11,"The increasing prevalence of digitized source material in the humanities has led to uncertainty about how this suddenly available information will change scholars' research methods. What balance will scholars strike between in-depth examination of a few sources, and a more ""distant reading"" (Moretti 2005) of a large number of them? Our focus is specifically on text collections: comparing texts, and identifying and tracing patterns of language use. These tasks are not widely supported by any current software, but if humanities researchers want to use digitized text collections on a larger scale, they will need to do exactly such things.  We restrict ourselves to a particular collection: the North American antebellum slave narratives, written by fugitive slaves in the decades before the Civil War with the support of abolitionist sponsors. Scholars agree about the slave narrative's most basic conventions but it is likely that these narratives, with their extreme repetitiveness, may also manifest other regular features that have yet to be detected by scholars. This project aims to assist literary scholars in uncovering these patterns with computational techniques.  In collaboration with English scholars, we have built WordSeer, a system that can compare two or more narratives' grammatical features, and analyze the distribution of textual patterns throughout an entire collection. Our goal is for English scholars to be able to use our system to gather accurate information about language use patterns in a way that is intuitive, and natural to them.  We will present the system currently under development, and share the lessons we have learned while building a text exploration interface for use in the humanities.

1486,FS-50103-07,"Thomas Reid's account of the faculty of taste uses a perceptual model to explain how normal humans apprehend aesthetic qualities.  Reid's aesthetics is most well known for being an example of an expression theory of art.  On Reid's view, material objects possess aesthetic qualities in a merely derivative sense: they possess qualities that signify – and thus express – excellences of mind.  The secondary literature on Reid's aesthetics has focused a great deal on Reid's expression theory, in particular on whether it is inconsistent with his anti-subjectivism about aesthetic qualities.   The controversy surrounding this putative inconsistency has centered around the issue of whether Reid holds that aesthetic qualities are primary or secondary qualities.  I argue that Reid's views about the ontology of aesthetic qualities are unlikely to solve the puzzles that arise from the combination of an expression theory with anti-subjectivism.  They are unlikely to do so for three reasons.  First, Reid devotes little attention to the primary/secondary quality distinction, and the superficiality with which he treats it indicates how poorly suited the traditional distinction is to his overall views.  Second, one need not appeal to the distinction in order to resolve the tension between expression theory and anti-subjectivism.  Beauty and grandeur are properties of subjects, but this does not entail that they are subjective properties.  Third, one need not appeal to the distinction in order to explain Reid's account of the perception of aesthetic properties, the expressive powers of material objects or the objective status of beauty and grandeur.  To do this, one must appeal to the details of Reid theory of perception, including his anti-sensationalism and direct realism.

This paper asks what reasons could ever be offered to adjudicate this conflict.  On what basis might we decide that colors either can or cannot be beautiful?  I argue that eighteenth-century authors often drew their boundaries around beauty with one thought in mind: how the resulting category of the beautiful would affect morality.

Jerrold Levinson maintains that Hume's commitment to this biconditional gives rise to a problem that neither Hume nor his any of his interpreters considers: the problem of explaining why you should care what pleases ideal critics if you are not one yourself. I argue: (a) that this problem arises only if you hold an empiricist theory of aesthetic value (i.e., a theory that reduces the aesthetic value of a work to the value of the experience it affords), as Levinson does; (b) that Levinson's own solution to the problem cannot succeed; (c) that Hume's commitment to the biconditional is not a commitment to an empiricist theory of aesthetic value but to an empiricist theory of aesthetic evaluation; and (d) that Hume does not consider Levinson's problem because it does not arise for him, given that his theory of aesthetic value is not empirical (in the present-day sense) but primitivist.",James Shelley,American Society for Aesthetics National Conference,10/25/10,,,,,Hume and the Value of the Beautiful

This paper discusses the results of excavations of Late Archaic levels within these buildings, providing details of their forms, and allowing us to characterize dining and ritual practices, and important differences in patterns of food production and consumption. The results show extensive evidence in both buildings of communal feasting, the provisioning of food, and the integration of cult activities.  The economic and sociopolitical implications of public feasting are discussed in the context of evidence for centralized storage and scaled-up production of certain foods such as olive oil, which is represented by a lever-beam press. Community integration and civic identity are reflected in both buildings, but in different ways. The Monumental Civic Building encouraged a communal feast in which status distinctions were probably emphasized through the nuances of rituals and perhaps ceremonial allocation of sacrificial meat or special meals. On the other hand, the separate and segregated dining rooms within the andreion made it possible for participants to dine together, but separately; to be part of the civic community, while at the same time expressing corporate or kinship distinctions. The nature of the ceremonies and feasts in these two civic contexts suggests distinct but parallel modes of interaction and expressions of sociopolitical identity in the early city.",Donald C.

The results of work conducted during two study seasons (2007 and 2008) now permit the detailed reconstruction of olive storage and stages of olive-oil extraction in a two-room industrial building destroyed in the early 5th century B.C. One room was evidently used for storage of olives in pithoi, while the other, for various stages of processing: crushing, pressing, and oil separation. Evidence in the main room consists of a crushing block and basin; a hearth; sockets for three wooden press beams; a stone press weight, and fragments of two press beds apparently dislodged from a bench. The presence of olives, an oil-separation jar and mortar in adjoining store rooms; crushed olive in the main press room; and oleic acid residue on the press-bed fragments corroborate the architectural evidence. Our understanding of olive-oil extraction in the Aegean comes principally from vase painting, and prehistoric or 4th century and later contexts (Margaritis and Jones 2007; Foxhall 2007). The only known Archaic findspot in the Aegean is Klazomenai (Koparal and Iplikci 2004), where little actual equipment has survived the fourth-century reoccupation.

Remembering the boycotts and violence against Jews in Thrace through an arguably post-Holocaust narrative of Nazi anti-Semitism, this informant's account contrasts sharply with recent scholarship forging a link between such local violence and the Settlement Law (also 1934) that reflected wider state security interests targeting not only Turkish Jews, but also Muslim minorities such as Balkan immigrants and Kurdish tribes in the east. Effectively silent about the Turkish state's role in the violence, the informant draws attention to a normative public and scholarly narrative about Jews as protected minority in Turkey, as well as the association of anti-Jewish violence not with Turkey, but with Nazi Germany. What is significant about such divergent stories of the state and how can they illuminate historiographies that take shape and circulate in a variety of venues as ‘public history'? Drawing upon oral interviews with older Turkish Jews in Istanbul, Izmir and Edirne, this paper will explore the effective and real silences in their testimonies for what they can tell us about wider neighborhood, national and interethnic contexts, as well as the degree to which they undergird commonplace historiographies of the nation and academy.","Maureen Jackson ",Middle East Studies Association Annual Meeting 2011,12/04/2011,http://mymesa.arizona.edu/meeting program abs.php?pid=62a0040fc7fe4498072d48693c870f3c,"Meeting program, meeting of the Middle East Studies Association, November 2011, Washington, DC",,,The Silent Informant: Discordant Narratives of Public History in Turkey

Mina Loy (1882-1966) provides our network:  a poet, novelist, painter, fashion designer, lampshade maker, and gallery agent, she lived in London, Munich, Paris, Florence, Mexico, and New York, associating with writers and artists connected to Art Nouveau, cubism, futurism, dada, surrealism, and abstract expressionism. With the conference theme in mind, the roundtable will position Mina Loy as the center of a ""structure of innovation"" as a means of illuminating that structure from an altered perspective. Each participant will consider Loy in relation to a particular visual artist, movement, or institution in the visual arts, with the aim of using this connection to engage larger questions about gender and sexuality, the relationship between different media, and the history of the avant-garde. Although Loy is our starting point, we do not consider this roundtable a ""single-author"" conversation;  rather, Loy's work and connections to a variety of avant-garde movements will help us to map new constellations of artists, and to generate new ways of thinking about modernism and visual culture.","Susan Rosenbaum, Linda Kinnahan, Irene Gammel, Alex Goody, Susan Dunn, Suzanne Churchill",Modernist Studies Association: Structures of Innovation,10/8/2011,http://www.msa13.com/?s=roundtable+6,Modernist Studies Association 13th Annual Conference,http://msa.press.jhu.edu/conferences/msa13/index.html,Conference Website,"Shifting Structures of Innovation: Mina Loy, Visual Culture, and the Avant-Garde"
1669,FA-55502-10,"The discourses of tradition and modernity in the Muslim world have overwhelmingly focused on issues of gender and Islamic law, which have been perceived among the highest stakes in policy choices and cultural representations.  Modernity has been understood in this context in terms of greater legal rights for women.  Starting in the 1950s and ever since, Tunisia has implemented gender legislation expanding women's rights in family law. As a result, it has been at the forefront of the Arab world in regard to progressive legislation.  This paper first examines the meaning ascribed to the concept of modernity in the social science discourse on the Middle East as well as in the political rhetoric.  It then documents major phases of reforms in favor of women's rights in Tunisia and outlines the conditions that permitted or encouraged the continuity over the last half century.  The first wave of reforms in the 1950s transformed the legal construction of gender roles within the family.  The second wave in the 1990s redefined the conditions for the transmission of Tunisian citizenship.  Current debates concern primarily inheritance. In painting social change in broad strokes, I analyze the initial and pioneering phase of the 1950s as a reform resulting from the actions of a newly formed national state interested in building a new society at the end of colonial rule.  By contrast, the role of women's agency came into play in Tunisia starting in the 1980s and became more robust in the 1990s.  The consequences of the recent 2011 Jasmine Revolution still have to be explored. The evidence suggests that different political configurations can be conducive to reform and that the pursuit of modernity can be initiated by different social actors. ",Mounira M.

1670,FA-55502-10,"Ever since the wave of decolonization from the 1940s to the 1960s, family law has been caught between the discourse of modernity and that of tradition in the Middle East.  A popular view in Western Europe and in America sees modernity as representing the model of the West and tradition as embodying the authentic values of Islamic society.  Arguing against binary representations, I suggest that these discourses should be treated as reflections of political struggles rather than as immutable expressions of culture.  As elsewhere, culture in the Islamic world is deployed politically and strategically.  Furthermore, the discourses of tradition and modernity are complex and replete with internal contradictions, as there are multiple forms of tradition and multiple forms of modernity.  The paper discusses how issues of family law have been formulated in the context of struggles for power and how law is invoked as a way of either respecting or counteracting tradition.  Political groups that take widely different stands on family law all appeal to Islam as the ultimate source of inspiration for their particular position.  Issues of law, culture, tradition, modernity, and gender become inextricably intertwined.  In an effort to disentangle them, the paper asks a key question of political sociology: who is served by the discourse of modernity versus tradition about the law?  We need to differentiate between the states and social groups that find it advantageous to use the discourse of ""Islamic tradition"" and those that find it more beneficial to advocate ""modernity.""  The paper concludes that questions of power have to be brought to center stage when we consider the discourses of tradition and modernity in regard to family law in the Islamic world.",Mounira M.

More important, I will also use this essay to gesture toward the argument that forms the basis of the rest of my book: that cultural anxiety about the growing tendency to commodify identity helped to produce by mid-century a new narrative sub-genre, Victorian sensation fiction, which seems almost invariably—in its simultaneous preoccupations with missing goods and divided subjectivities—to hinge upon the consequences of subjecting identity to the same rules of greed, ownership, and power as other forms of ""portable property.""",Sean C.

In the broadest sense, what I suggest in the book is that these two forms of literary ""entertainment"" are joined ideologically, and that sensation fiction emerged at least partly as a literary response to the underlying logic of increasingly commercial autobiographical writing. Locally, in this presentation, what I want specifically is to discuss the contours of autobiography's transformation into a commercial genre, and to articulate the cultural and theoretical meanings of that transformation. At its imaginative core, autobiography is a consequence of the literary calculus by which the intimate utterances of the author—indeed, the author herself or himself—become the consumable products of a capitalist age. In 1827, an anonymous writer for the Quarterly Review lamented the ""mania for . . . Confessions, and Recollections, and Reminiscences"" since such texts demonstrated a new and appalling tendency for writers to market ""the secret workings of their own minds.""

1692,FT-53201-05,"In this essay, I make two related arguments about Victorian autobiography, one rooted in book history and the other deduced from the consequences of this Victorian tendency to textualize and commodify the Victorian subject. First, using material I have drawn from periods of archival research at the British Library, the Bentley Archive, the John Murray Archive, and other resources, I demonstrate the ways in which Victorian autobiography emerged as a deliberately commodified genre of English prose. Second, working from contemporary reviews, Victorian legal culture, and post-modern theory, I argue that the emerging logic of subject-as-commodity produced crucial new anxieties as well as literary modes for their expression. The most important of these was sensation fiction with its incorrigible tendency to make missing wills, stolen jewels, and other ""greed"" plots return to problems of psychological fragmentation and the necessity of narrating and textualizing the self. At stake, as I will show, was the gradual collapse of the boundary between identity and property—a collapse that revised the Victorian notion of the subject according to the dangerous requirements of the market.",Sean C.

1693,FT-53201-05,"Drawing from Chapter 1 of my current project, I argue in this paper that autobiography and sensation fiction alike proliferated at mid-century at least partly from a common cause: a Victorian legal culture that steadily redefined subjectivity as an object of profit and exchange. As I will show, autobiography ""rose"" during the first part of the Victorian period as a culmination of the logic inherent in copyright—a logic that insisted with greater and greater urgency that the identity of the author belonged intrinsically to the ink and paper of the text. Equally important, under the unfavorable copyright laws of the first half of the nineteenth century, many authors wrote autobiography for deliberately commercial reasons, appending ""recollections"" or ""reminiscences"" to their collected works in order to extend their rights of property in earlier publications. Even apart from copyright law—for instance, in the period's more vigorous census-taking, licensing and registry requirements, and creation of Civil Service examinations—Victorian legal culture tended overwhelmingly to locate the subject in the official written record that might be composed and to implicate it in the dynamics of a rapidly expanding commodity culture. By working through these facets of Victorian legal culture, my aim is finally to trace both autobiography and sensation fiction to a common ideological root: the legal invention of the subject as an explicitly commodified thing, vulnerable to textual and therefore economic incursions and consequently a fit emblem of the new capitalist age.",Sean C.

1694,FT-53201-05,"Drawn from my book-in-progress, this paper argues that the particular dynamics of textualization and subjection at work in Lady Audley's Secret originate in the strategies for commodifying femininity that emerged during the first half of the nineteenth century. Partly, as I will show, femininity came to be commodified through the extraordinary proliferation of autobiography during the first half of the century, since that proliferation tended broadly but inexorably to create a new relation between the subject and the rules of ownership and exchange. (Indeed, a working hypothesis for my book is that the proliferation of autobiography largely engendered the anxiety about identity that is invariably so prominent in Victorian sensation novels of the 1860s.) More particularly, as Lady Audley's portrait suggests, Braddon's novel returns also to the strategies by which the visual arts came to represent, contain, and ultimately commodify femininity, at once neutralizing and cashing in on the particular dangers of illicit feminine sexuality. What I argue finally is that Lady Audley's transformation into a textual thing in the novel—or, I should say, into several textual things—makes her eventual subjection to masculine power inevitable, and that this transformation finally belongs to a distinctly Victorian logic of textuality and the market.",Sean C Grass,Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western U.

1695,FT-53201-05,"Drawing from the concluding chapter of my book-in-progress, I argue here that the Tichborne case offers a culminating ""view"" of this problem in the most significant sense of that word, for it played out spectacularly in the public spaces of Victorian courtrooms, legal papers, and the popular press, where it became tabloid fodder and even appeared as The Tichborne Romance for George Routledge in 1872, a year before the criminal trial began. The paper begins with a brief account of the Tichborne case and its emergence as a cause célèbre then assesses in detail the ways in which the case really put on display not just the opportunisitic fraud Arthur Orton but also a grosser Victorian monstrosity: the legal and cultural evolution of a Victorian subject inseparable and even indistinguishable from property, which became in turn—as earlier chapters on Silas Marner, Our Mutual Friend,  The Eustace Diamonds, and other works illustrate—a driving preoccupation for the mid-century novel.",Sean C.

16540,FT-264476-19,"Ernest Hemingway's inclusion among the heroes of the Soviet Union is meaningful beyond the author's own world-wide fame. Symbolically, it was the moment when the most-American of authors gained a Soviet biography; when Hemingway was fully and completely co-opted into the Soviet literary space. Understanding that Hemingway would not achieve political consciousness in the Socialist Realist sense, Gribanov positioned his subject as an independent writer and journalist dedicated to telling the truth, often to the detriment of his personal and professional relationships. This interpretation was original given preceding Soviet interpretation of the American author and his works. It was also somewhat risky within the context of the trial of the writers Andrei Siniavskii and Yulii Daniel. In this paper, I will argue that with such an approach, Gribanov positioned the author as an independent truth-teller, in the face of political ideologies and repressive governments, appealing to avid readers of Hemingway as well as to a Soviet readership taught to read between the lines.",Frederick H.

16541,FT-264476-19,"Between 1936 and 1939 Ernest Hemingway began to display a political commitment that made him attractive to left-leaning American critics and to Soviet cultural merchants. His former contempt for any ideology and a willingness to expose the sham made his public image even more salient once he became an outspoken antifascist. Hemingway's departure for Spain as a news correspondent to cover the Spanish Civil War was praised in the Soviet Union, where there was some anticipation that the author would move beyond the pessimism, skepticism and individualism that had been noted in his early literary works. ""The Chauffeurs of Madrid"" appeared in the journal Abroad (Za rubezhom) on 25 June 1937. The novel To Have and Have Not was published in October 1937 and a Russian translation soon followed in International Literature (Internatsional'naia literatura) with a tentatively positive response from Soviet critics. A portion of his film script, The Spanish Earth, was published in the newspaper Izvestiia on 29 December 1937. The entire film script was published in International Literature in 1938.  Yet, it was Hemingway's play, The Fifth Column that was met with unanimous enthusiasm. It was translated into Russian and published in the first number of International Literature for 1939.  This paper will examine in some detail Hemingway's emerging social consciousness and the positive response of his Soviet critics that validated their earlier efforts to co-opt the American author for the Soviet experiment.",Frederick H.

16546,HAA-258763-18,"The success of plan recognition is determined by two main factors: 1). quality of the plan image, and 2). interpretation of the plan information. Plan image quality includes factors such as clarity, contrast, and digital noise. A high-quality plan image has high contrast, minimal noise, and clear lines and text. Plan interpretation is essentially how well the system is able to process and make sense of the layers of plan information. A basic floor plan that includes walls, windows, doors, and room labels is easier for the system to interpret than a plan with additional layers of information, such as furniture, dimension stringers, material symbols, grids, landscaping, and ceilings or rooflines. These additional layers of information can result in the plan detection misidentifying other lines as walls, for example. By testing each of these variables, we are able to determine how to improve plan for users. This poster will explore the results of these tests and suggest areas for improvement.

In her 1940 MFA thesis she wrote that the mother-child motif was ""one in which blackness and femaleness intersect."" In the late 1960s, after race riots engulfed major US cities and the release of the Moynihan Report damning the state of the Negro family, Catlett's prints started to explore the trauma of Black motherhood and the impossibility of biological reproduction in such times of crisis. This paper analyzes a selection of Catlett's prints from 1969-1980 and argues that Catlett deploys repetition and seriality as artistic strategies to counter the negative mainstream discourses concerning Black women. While Catlett's early career has received scholarly attention, her late-career printmaking practice (post-1970) remains heretofore understudied as such this paper addresses this lacuna while also offering new insights into contemporary African American printmaking practices.",Rebecca VanDiver,"""My Art Speaks for Both My Peoples"" A Symposium on Elizabeth Catlett",10/04/19,http://library.udel.edu/special/catlett-symposium/,,,,From the Black Feminist Matrix: Artistic and Biological Reproduction  in Elizabeth Catlett's late career Prints
16603,HB-258214-18,"Lockers were central to the quotidian functioning of al-Azhar as a center of Islamic teaching and learning. Students and scholars used lockers to store quires, codices, writing materials and instruments, vessels, kettles, utensils, bread, bedding, clothing, headgear, and valuables. Over time, lockers took the form of capital, which, if inherited or purchased, could be parlayed into financial gain, and, occasionally, into locker empires (shares in multiple lockers). Ottoman sijill records from 1530 to 1650 show that usufruct rights to lockers passed through family networks and circulated beyond those directly associated with al-Azhar. When Shaykh Ahmad al-Ghunaymi al-Ansari died in 1634-5, the renowned Arabic grammarian and scholar of dialectical theology (kalam) had built a locker empire at al-Azhar; at the age of 80, he held usufruct rights to eight lockers in the Fuwwat fraternity. This paper studies the social lives of Ahmad's lockers following his death, the reallocation of three lockers to students and scholars of al-Azhar, and the inheritance and sale of five lockers by his son Kamal al-Din and widow Kulthum. This paper builds on the insights of Arjun Appadurai, Celia Lury, and Igor Kopytoff, who demonstrate that a biographical approach to material objects, for example, the study of ‘paths' and ‘life histories' of objects, can illuminate their human and social context. This approach, when applied to al-Azhar's lockers, can offer insight into the everyday lives of Muslim educational institutions, and the values of the men and women connected to them.",Irfana Hashmi,Middle Eastern Studies Association (MESA) Annual Meeting (Beyond Islamic Art: New Approaches to the Material Culture of the Middle East),11/15/2019,https://mesana.org/annual-meeting,Middle Eastern Studies Association Annual Meeting Website,https://mesana.org/mymesa/meeting program session.php?sid=b3d9ad801252df1559e2961d03855a6c,Program Session,"The Lockers of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ghunaymi al-Ansari at al-Azhar Mosque, 1634 to 1637"

These cases demonstrate that medieval viewers were quite happy to accept Pope Gregory the Great's invitation to read images as the literate read texts.

16819,PR-234235-16,"Digital data play increasingly prominent roles in archaeological research. However, data tend to be considered ""raw materials"" that fuel scholarship and not as intellectual contributions in their own right. Most attention on ""research data management"" focuses on ""management"" where data are considered mainly through the lens of Taylorism (bureaucratic compliance, standards, incentives, and metrics). Research data management largely aims for ""Big Data"" research opportunities achieved through centralization, economies of scale, and the efficient production of measurable research outcomes. To provoke debate, this paper suggests an alternative model of ""Slow Data"" that emphasizes thoughtful consideration of data throughout the research process. Our experience with Open Context shows that to be usable by a wider community, data require substantive intellectual investment in modeling and validation. Ideally, researchers should plan for reuse outcomes well before they start data collection. Thus, the intellectual investment underlying data curation must become more integral to the whole practice of archaeology. Rather than simply rewarding high throughput and impact for easily-measured research outputs (papers or even archived datasets), greater recognition for the research process will promote better contextualization of data, leading to meaningful research outcomes from data integration, greater reproducibility, and better ethical practice.",Eric C.

16820,PR-234235-16,"The scholarly community is giving data increasing attention in recent years, and solutions for data management are emerging. However, seeing data management primarily as a matter of compliance means that we face continued data loss, as many datasets enter repositories without adequate description to enable their reuse. Furthermore, because many researchers have little experience reuse of public data, they lack understanding and incentives to consider changes in their own research practices to facilitate future reuse. Improving data reuse raises the issue of data standards. While many researchers employ standards for simplifying comparisons across datasets, they are constrained by the fact that standards reflect research goals and agendas that are not necessarily universally shared. This paper discusses Linked Open Data (LOD) as an approach to improving data description, intelligibility, and discoverability to facilitate reuse. I present examples of how annotating zooarchaeology datasets with LOD can facilitate data integration without forcing standardization. I conclude by recognizing that data sharing is not without its challenges.

However, our discipline has long recognized the uphill battle in motivating and financing completion of such works. Changes in the economics of publishing, as well as the rapid proliferation of digital documentation, create new challenges for publishing primary field research in archaeology. Currently, the majority of the evidence (now digital) collected in field research is left behind in the publication process. Rather than consider digital data as a residue of our work that, if lucky, may end up in a repository, we should explore new publication models that richly integrate digital data with narrative syntheses. This paper highlights how this can be cost-effective, improve the reproducibility of archaeological interpretation, reach broader audiences, and have wider impacts. To accomplish these goals, we discuss key aspects of information architecture and the challenge of developing publication workflows that support both narrative and data editorial processes.","Eric C.

Abstract: Most archaeologists today use computers and other digital technology to document their work. Many develop data management plans, as required by many funders of archaeology in recent years. Still, most archaeologists lack a clear understanding of both how to make their data widely accessible and intelligible for reuse, and why they would want to do so. This forum discusses the FAIR Data Principles, developed to guide data creators and publishers in making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Each forum discussant will select one FAIR principle to discuss in the context of archaeology. How well does archaeology currently address each of these challenges? Since archaeology can be a destructive practice, how much effort should we put into ensuring that our data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable? What can we do to ensure that these goals are prioritized at a project's inception, rather than as an afterthought? How do we ensure that archaeologists collecting data also share algorithms, tools, and workflows that led to that data? Are there additional principles that define ""good"" data dissemination in archaeology?

Public and private granting bodies recognize the importance of data, and often formalize this recognition by requiring grant seekers to provide ""data management plans."" However, many archaeologists lack familiarity with good research data management practices and how these articulate with other aspects of research. This paper is informed by the ongoing, NEH-funded Secret Life of Data (SLO-Data, https://alexandriaarchive.org/secret-life-of-data/) study which uses evidence from observations of ongoing excavations as well as interviews with reusers to improve archaeological data workflows and guide researchers in how to create meaningful data management plans. The discussion will consider each step of the research life-cycle from planning, data modeling, fieldwork, laboratory, and collections studies, to collaboration within teams and, finally, dissemination, preservation, and reuse. We will highlight the intellectual commitment needed to contextualize data, including the need to link and relate project data with the data contributions curated by other experts. The paper will also highlight criteria that need to be considered in peer review so that grant review processes can better recognize and reward excellence. Finally, responsible research data management needs to be more integral to publishing and not just granting practices.

16833,PR-234235-16,"Archaeologists share an ethical obligation to publish, archive, and share their field data and research results. One expectation of making archaeological data publicly available is its eventual reuse. Yet, research into archaeological data reuse demonstrates that building accessible data repositories does not necessarily result in substantial reuse of archaeological data (Huggett 2018). What limitations prevent archaeological data from reuse and how can these be addressed during and after archaeological fieldwork?  The Secret Life of Data (SLO-data) project follows the lifecycle of data from the field to the digital repository to better understand opportunities and challenges in data interpretation, publication, and reuse. We use a mixed-methods approach of interviews, field observations, and excavation data assessments to identify the challenges faced by four different archaeological sites around the world. Our subjects are international teams comprised of senior excavation staff, students, registrars, and specialists, all engaged with data creation, but sometimes asynchronously and with personnel changes from year to year. In this paper, we report common findings that impeded archaeological data reuse across these four projects based on interviews and observations conducted during the 2016-2018 field seasons. We then review how technical and organizational adjustments that resulted from these findings impacted data creation and management practices at each site. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings can be applied to  archaeological projects more broadly to better streamline data collection during fieldwork and in the lab for project sharing and eventual reuse.

16863,FEL-262343-19,"This paper examines the historical significance of the rebuilding of Laupahoehoe School, a Hawai‘i public school on the eastern coastline of Hawai‘i Island. The original school, along with major roads and infrastructure, was destroyed when an enormous tidal wave hit the island in April 1946. The destruction of the school came at a time (just after World War II) when Hawai‘i's population was growing rapidly, and older buildings were stretched to capacity with wartime children. Alfred Preis, a Jewish refugee architect from Nazi-occupied Vienna was selected to develop the Laupahoehoe design. Until 1946, Pries's work in Hawai‘i had remained closely wedded to the Austrian modernist form languages he had learned while studying in Vienna; he hadn't quite absorbed the ways in which design in the tropics could, or should, be different from architecture in temperate Europe. At Laupahoehoe, however, the post-disaster situation – which included impassable roads and serious difficulties importing building materials – forced Preis to improvise and to develop his skills as a tropical, regionalist architect. Preis used locally sourced materials, such as lava rock and ohia trees – a highly significant plant in indigenous tradition – and developed a passive climate control system derived from local wind patterns. He married these materials and techniques to his own Viennese traditions about ornament, and functional and spatial planning, creating a singularly regionalist building. At Laupahoehoe School, Preis thus put forward a new vision of tropical architecture for the islands – one that made modernism Hawaiian.",Laura McGuire,"Meeting of the International Network for Tropical Architecture, Brisbane, Australia, Dec. 5-8, 2019",12/08/19,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z5m5iblm mrnnwmuDBOfG9j81dEmwZCv/view?usp=sharing,“Making Modernism Hawaiian: Rebuilding Laupahoehoe School After a Tidal Wave”  Conference paper presentation by Laura McGuire,,,“Making Modernism Hawaiian: Rebuilding Laupahoehoe School After a Tidal Wave”

Corporate-funded clinical trials, free lunches, free travel, and industry honoraria for scientists have been shown to adversely affect the integrity of biomedical research. Despite the broad recognition of these hazards, efforts to address them have largely been limited to disclosure requirements. Current standards require clinical researchers to report certain conflicts of interest alongside published scholarship. Unfortunately, a growing body of evidence indicates that disclosure statements have been shown to cause audiences to actually extend more trust to those holding conflicts of interest, as disclosure provides an opportunity to display both honesty and expertise. disclosure requirements embody some of the most concerning aspects of neoliberal oversight in that they focus attention on individual behavior rather than cultural conditions. Ultimately, a significant shift in our understanding of conflicts of interest is required, and this is where the insights of computational rhetorics can be beneficial. Accordingly, this paper presents findings derived from a computational analysis of 34 million biomedical research articles. Specifically, this paper explores the development a new integrated machine-learning, named-entity recognition toolkit designed to extracting financial relationships data from natural language and visualize those relationships using interactive network diagrams.

16977,HAA-258763-18,"Frank Lloyd Wright remains one of America's best known and most prolific architects, credited with designing more than 1,000 structures. Such a sizable oeuvre holds hundreds of thousands of data points. Much of this data, however, remains untapped. Wright's floor plans, for example, are full of rich layers of information (e.g., tracking room names over time can indicate changing societal preferences/shifts). But to utilize the data in hundreds or thousands of these plans, requires either reproducing them in CAD or BIM or measuring and recording the information by hand. Both are time consuming and prone to error. In response, we developed a tool that allows users to analyze large corpora of architectural floor plan images. The Building Database &amp; Analytics System (BuDAS) unites complementary manual data entry and image recognition to automate the process of floor plan detection and analysis. In this study, we explore Wright's changing conception of space through an analysis of his residential floor plans using BuDAS.   Space is a topic Wright discussed frequently throughout his career, including in his autobiography and principles of organic architecture, among other venues. But do Wright's pontifications on space stand in accordance with his built work? Using floor plan images of Wright's residences uploaded to BuDAS, we collected information on room relationships, doors/openings, room sizes, and room names/categories. After uploading plan images, BuDAS automatically detects and collects information related to room sizes, types, and relationships. This, along with contextual information entered manually (e.g., location, date of construction, cost, name of client), is stored in the database for analysis.  Using the data collected from Wright's residential floor plans, we explore interior and exterior space usage (minimum, average, and maximum square footage) and room relationships (connectivity, adjacency, and openness) over the course of his career.","Elise King, Qiannan Wu, David Lin",,03/06/2020,https://www.idec.org/files/conf/2020%20IDEC%20Annual%20Conference%20Friday%20Presentation%20Schedule.pdf,,,,Exploring Frank Lloyd Wright through the Lens of ‘Big Data’

Processions outside the church, for instance, were conducted in song, from the psalms and litanies that filled the great distances to the antiphons and responsories that marked important cultic destinations. Chapter meetings, too, included the singing of multiple kinds of chant. This paper explores a little known practice in a forgotten musical setting: the singing of chant in and around the monastic refectory. If we are accustomed to thinking of the refectory as a place of silence, medieval customaries show that this was not the case. Through its rituals and layout, the refectory became a sacred space, linked in many ways to the choir and altar of the church. Indeed, the intoning of blessings and readings and sometimes even the singing of psalms, antiphons, or other chants before and after mealtime made the monks refectio not so much a break from the liturgy as a continuation of it, and a commentary upon it. Indeed, the use of music in the refectory reflected the liturgical season and the relative festivity of the liturgy in the church. This paper relies on customaries, ordinals, prayer books, and other historical sources to illuminate the performance of chant before, during, and after mealtime in the medieval monastery.",Tova Leigh-Choate,"18th Meeting of the IMS Study Group “Cantus Planus,” Dublin, Ireland",08/06/2016,,,,,Singing for Their Supper: Chant in the Medieval Refectory
16997,FB-57854-14,"From its early days as a Christian city, Paris—like many cities in France—was defined in relation to the life and death of its first evangelizer and bishop. The earliest passio of Saint Denis, from the late fifth or early sixth century, described the saint's arrival, evangelical activities, and martyrdom in the pagan stronghold. Abbot Hilduin's famous ninth-century passio further elaborated the city's sacred topography, from its center, where Saint Denis endured torments and imprisonment, to Montmartre, where the saint and his companions suffered martyrdom. But the saint's medieval cult centered on the abbey of Saint-Denis outside Paris, the burial place chosen (according to Hilduin) by the head-toting martyr himself. Indeed, the suburban abbey enjoyed unrivaled prosperity and fame as the shrine of the royal patron saint, the royal necropolis and depository, and the beneficiary of the famous Lendit and Saint Denis fairs. It also boasted independence from the bishop of Paris.  This paper explores the efforts of the Notre-Dame canons and Capetian kings to claim the cult of Saint Denis for the city, particularly after Paris became the uncontested capital of the French kingdom in the twelfth century. These efforts included the canons' centuries-long contest over the saint's cranium; their particular elaborations of his festal liturgies and institution of a new feast, the Susceptio reliquiarum; their frequent processions to the stational church of Saint-Denis-du-Pas; and their annual processions to Montmartre. The monarchy, while increasing its allegiance to the abbey of Saint-Denis, also augmented the saint's urban legacy by endowing churches associated with places in his vita et passio, calling for urban processions of his relics, and instituting his liturgical cult at the Sainte-Chapelle. This paper thus maps the sacred topography of medieval Paris as the city of Saint Denis.",Tova Leigh-Choate,"International Medieval Society—Paris, Annual Symposium, 26 June 2015",06/26/2015,,,,,"The Sacred Topography of Medieval Paris: Relics, Routes, and Song in the City of Saint Denis"

Until the 1750s, London Friends signalled strongly that maintaining unity was of primary importance, largely silencing prophetic anti-slavery voices.

2148,RZ-51162-10,"•In stark comparison to Thessaly and the Argolid, the study of Middle Helladic ceramics in central Greece has had to face a number of significant obstacles. One of these has been a lack of preserved stratigraphy from which to develop a stratified ceramic typology. Where stratigraphy has been recorded, as at Eutresis, the issue has been one of continuity in occupation. While the recent publication of the material from Orchomenos IV by K. Sarri has greatly contributed to an understanding of the development of Middle Helladic pottery, these problems continue to persist. This particularly affects the understanding of the so called ‘Grey Minyan' material (herein referred to as ‘Fine Grey Burnished') which seems to have been produced at one or more production centres in central Greece. The recent excavations at Mitrou have revealed in two deep trenches, located in different areas of the site, impressive sequences of MH deposits that are well stratified, related to architecture and span the whole of the Middle Helladic period. This enables the development of a stratified ceramic typology for central Greece which spans the whole of the period for the first time. This paper aims to present characteristics of the Fine Grey Burnished typology from all 7 Mitrou phases ranging from the end of Early Helladic III to the end of the Middle Helladic.",Christopher M.

2149,RZ-51162-10,"Our knowledge of the LH IIIC pottery in east Central Greece is defined by discoveries at three major sites: Lefkandi, Kynos and Kalapodi. When starting the excavations at Mitrou, supported by promising results of the CHELP surface survey, it was hoped that Mitrou would join the ‘big three'.  It undoubtedly did, but not in an obvious way. At a site like Mitrou, it was reasonable to expect to find a LH IIIC Middle phase with elaborate, pictorial pottery and a rich repertoire of shapes, decent evidence for LH IIIC Late and, in fortunate circumstances, the transition to the EIA with the so-far elusive Submycenaean phase. After 5 years of excavation we are forced to verify these expectations. The LH IIIC Middle is difficult to define and there is nothing even remotely reminiscent of pictorial pottery.  Surprisingly, the LH IIIC Late period is the most exciting one with an unusual array of finds. Submycenaean, apart from one or two graves with a few vessels, is not detectable. In this paper, I will briefly describe the local pottery sequence and highlight some of the major discoveries.

The assemblages date to all three phases of the period and, most importantly, they come from both settlement and funerary contexts. The pottery stands in the Central Greek tradition (or what has become to be known as ‘Euboean koine') and, in this respect, will add little to our knowledge in terms of morphology and decoration. However, focusing on a deposit from an apsidal Building A, I will discuss two issues that seem to be new in the field. In a traditional way, the deposit should be characterized as a mixed assemblage of Middle and Late Protogeometric pottery. In spite of this ‘mixture', I will argue for the deposit being chronologically homogeneous and claim, with some external supporting evidence, that it represents a distinctive ceramic phase dated to the early stage of Late Protogeometric period. In the second part of my talk I will focus on technological aspect of Protogeometric fine wares, namely the building techniques. I will argue that not all the fine pottery was thrown but in fact wheel-coiled or wheel fashioned.

The wood was not preserved, but its disintegration had left a black stain in the shape of the boat's bottom. About half of this boat stain was excavated over a length of approximately 3 m and a maximum width of 1 m. The total hull length is estimated to have been 5.5–6.0 m. It was a slender craft, lanceolate in shape, curving gently in cross-section and profile, and tapering toward a blunt extremity. &#x0D; The boat is dated to the Middle Helladic II Early pottery phase and must have been built ca. 1900 B.C.

Thus, it is highly significant for our understanding of Aegean boatbuilding.&#x0D; With its extremely thin hull and gentle curves, the Mitrou boat closely resembles expanded logboats of ancient and medieval date excavated in northern Europe.

First, they include some features that are uncommon in non-Palatial sites, among which the comparatively high frequency of Rosette deep bowls is particularly striking. Second, LH IIIB2 deposits from Mitrou appear to be contemporary with the final catastrophes that affected the palaces of Mycenae, Tiryns, Midea, and Thebes, later than the destructions of Gla and Orchomenos, and slightly earlier than that of Dimini. The combination of these factors raises intriguing questions concerning the political geography of East Lokris in the final decades of the 13th century B.C.: were Mitrou and the surrounding region under the control of any Mycenaean Palace during this period? If this was the case, which of the powerful centres situated in the vicinity may be considered the best candidate?    &#x0D; ","Vitale, Salvatore","4th Archaeological Meeting of Thessaly and Central Greece 2009-2012, From  Prehistory to the Contemporary Period, Volos",03/18/12,,,,,"Late Helladic IIIB Pottery from Mitrou, East Lokris: Relative Chronology, Typology, and Wider Significance"

In the settlement two elite complexes were constructed and long paved orthogonal roads were laid out, arguably intended to monumentalize performances of some sort.&#x0D; The manipulation of the mortuary realm played a major role in the visualization of elite power. In LH I, two elite tombs were created in prominent locations and linked to a major road, ostensibly to enhance the performance value of elite mortuary rituals. One of these was Built Chamber Tomb 73, uniquely set inside elite complex D. At the same time, the long-standing practice of burying the dead among settlement buildings was abandoned, and possibly a permanent cemetery established to enhance a sense of community and create a larger mortuary landscape as backdrop for the elite tombs.

2156,RZ-51162-10,"The study of urban sites is usually based on the analysis of architectural or cultural phases. The sediments of the excavated deposits inside or outside houses are rarely studied. The prehistoric site of Mitrou has a ca. 5-m deep archaeological sequence ranging from the Early Bronze Age through the Early Iron Age (ca. 2400-900 BCE). This provides a unique opportunity to study changes in the construction and maintenance of earthen floors and surfaces over a long time and relate them to cultural developments. The preliminary micromorphological study of more than 240 thin sections shows that the surfaces from the Early to Late Bronze I phases Mitrou has all the characteristics of a tell site with multiple replasterings of surfaces and a broad palette of material and techniques used. There is no clear association of a building phase to a floor level but rather to thick sequences of floor build-up. This practice ends sometime in the LH I phase, and from then on, floors are not frequently repaired and their construction technique is more standardized. The observed change can be broadly related to the rise of a local ruling elite at Mitrou. &#x0D; &#x0D; Moreover, the contrasting maintenance techniques are pertinent to the discussions on the difference between tells and 'flat' settlements. Until the end of the Middle Helladic period, Mitrou has all the characteristics of a tell site whereas after that it resembles a 'flat' settlement. In Mitrou it appears that this change is related to a different perception of construction and maintenance of floors that in turn should be traced to the pattern of reconstruction of whole houses. As part of the material culture of a society these changes have a social significance that may reflect differences in household processes and space use.&#x0D; ",Panagiotis Karkanas,"DIG (Developing International Geoarchaeology) conference, University of  Tennessee, Knoxville",09/22/11,,,,,"Micromorphological Analysis of Sediments at the Bronze Age Site of Mitrou, Central Greece: Patterns of Floor Construction and Maintenance"

2175,FT-54231-06,"Among the endeavors whereby the first Saxon emperor, Otto I, emulated Charlemagne were his campaigns into the pagan territories along the eastern frontier of the German kingdom.  Here, Otto sought to convert Slavs and Hungarians to Roman Christianity and thus to subjugate them.  Charlemagne had proceeded in a similar fashion against the very Saxons whose descendant Otto was.  One weapon within Otto's missionary arsenal was the eastern archbishopric of Magdeburg.  Here, the fabric of the cathedral incorporated spolia Otto acquired in Ravenna in emulation of Charlemagne's spoliation of ancient Italian sites on behalf of his palatine complex at Aachen.  Among Otto's Ravennate loot were several porphyry columns now in the choir at Magdeburg.  One such column, however, was culled from the larger group and presented to the community of canonesses resident in Essen, where it stands in the apse of the former convent church, testament, like several Egyptian rock crystal vessels in the treasury, of Otto's intentions for the convent--from 971/973, Essen was ruled by a succession of Ottonian princess-abbesses and served as a prominent locus of Ottonian authority.  In this paper, the example of Essen serves as a platform from which to explore Otto's exploitation of porphyry and rock crystal to construct, visibly and tangibly, such loci.  In bestowing these gifts on Essen, furthermore, Otto was relying on a Carolingian strategy rooted within traditions of Greco-Roman kingship display.  The selective placement of spoliated porphyry slabs around Charlemagne's throne in the Palatine Chapel at Aachen and the presentation by Charles the Bald of the so-called Cup of Solomon, with its rock crystal portrait of a Persian king, to the monastery of St.-Denis represent two Carolingian instances of the calculated exploitation of these materials, a strategy adopted by Otto I to establish, enhance, and propagate Ottonian imperial authority.",Karen Blough,Forty-Third 	Annual International Conference on Medieval Studies,5/8/2008,,,,,Fit for a King:  Carolingian and Ottonian Display Strategies
2176,FT-54231-06,"Over the course of several years spent studying the valuable gifts presented by the Ottonian rulers to the monasteries and convents they favored, it has become increasingly clear to me that the lines of inquiry I have followed have produced a rather one-sided understanding of these donations.  I have demonstrated that the intent of the royal donors in presenting many of these gifts was to mark the recipient house as a locus of Ottonian imperial authority, and that the beneficiaries' responses indicate a consonant understanding of the gift.  For example, the early art patronage of Abbess Mathilde of Essen, including the first of her two processional crosses as well as the so-called Golden Virgin, is clearly in keeping with the message intended by Otto I when he presented a porphyry column--unequivocal symbol of imperial status--to Essen just a few years before.  The fact that the small diadem with which, it is believed, the child Otto III was crowned was subsequently presented to Essen, where it rested on the head of the Golden Virgin on particularly important feast-days, visually reiterated the relationship between Mathilde's convent and the Ottonian dynasty in a strikingly vivid fashion.  But how were these visual symbols received and interpreted by their broader audience, the secular community of Essen whose spiritual life was the responsibility of the convent?  This paper is a prolegomenon on the topic, establishing basic facts:  who saw the imperial gifts, where, and on what occasions; who enabled access to them; and what display rituals and texts were employed.  The survival of an ordinale from medieval  Essen, rich in details concerning the quotidian spiritual activities of the convent and its neighbors, offers solid ground from which to proceed.  I conclude by offering some suggestions concerning the signification that accrued to the imperial gifts, through display and ritual, in the eyes and minds of the mundane audience.    &#x0D; &#x0D; ",Karen Blough,Forty-Fourth Annual International Conference on Medieval Studies,5/10/2009,,,,,Playing to the Crowd:  Imperial Donations and Their Audiences in Medieval Essen

This talk uses transcribed videotaped data to examine topics at issue in a conversational conflict revealing the tense social relations entailed by rapid social change. In a Zapotec dialogue, an elder woman noticed a young Zapotec teacher-assistant addressing his daughter in Spanish. She posed a question explicitly topicalizing whether his daughter understands Zapotec, and implicitly, critically topicalizing the emerging code-shifting socialization style. Ironic statements introduce two topics: one coded in the proposition and another that lurks in the inferential pragmatics. The man only orients to and ratifies the explicit topic.  Only after his ""missing"" the inference over several turns does the woman make the topic explicit, and then shifts to a less controversial topic. Topical irony as indirect critique is a discursive device that allows for ideological contestation without profoundly damaging ongoing social relations. This appeals to the polite social context where the man is a visitor in the woman's household. The new socialization style of addressing children exclusively in Spanish represents a contemporary transformation of the political-economy and the ongoing integration of the autonomous indigenous region into the Mexican nation state.

In this paper, we examine the practice of inscribing personal messages on columns, with a focus on the Campus ad Amphitheatrum, in Pompeii (Regio II.7.1).

By virtue of its location, the building certainly saw a high volume of traffic. In this paper we examine how ancient writers approached this unique type of writing surface, how they negotiated the lack of horizontal space, and how they fashioned their writings in response. We also interrogate the spaces of the building and the distribution patterns of textual and figural graffiti on the columns of the Campus ad amphitheatrum to address the following questions: On which columns within a long colonnade were individuals more prone to write? Where would a writer prefer to stand? Within the covered walkway? Between the columns where he would be less visible? In the uncovered space where fewer might see his drawing or message?

These materials also challenged artisans to explore their properties and push limits for their conceptualizations of beauty. With contact and colonization, exchange and appreciation led to the exploitation of some of these natural resources as well as the labor that procured them. Studies of Native American material culture as well as Atlantic World trade address organics and their exchange, particularly in instances of plenty or scarcity, but decorative arts scholarship on the subject has room to grow. This presentation will offer an overview of several organic materials with historic impact not just for their novelty or utility, but for fostering development in early American arts and habits of domestic life.",Ann Wagner,"Colonial Williamsburg Antiques Forum, Williamsburg, Virginia",2/25/2020,https://media.colonialwilliamsburg.org/media/documents/72nd Annual Antiques Forum Celebrates The American Home Feb. 21-25 2020 .pdf,Promotional PDF for the conference.,,,Sea Horse Teeth &amp; Other Hidden Organic in the American Home
17110,MT-263872-19,"As part of Valparaiso University's Flight Paths project, I worked on archiving and digitizing important documents at St. John's Lutheran Church in Gary, Indiana. My research follows the history of the church from its beginning as a church plant in Tolleston (now annexed into Gary) onwards with an emphasis on how the church adapted and changed during the period of White Flight in Gary. As more black residents moved into Gary, white residents packed up and left. Coupled with the closing of many of Gary's factories, the result was a drastic shift in racial and economic demographics. The church, which is part of the Lutheran Church Missouri-Synod, survived White Flight largely due to the efforts of interim pastor Karl Lutze and the next resident pastor, Norman Brandt, who were both dedicated to integration of the church. The efforts for integration were largely successful, leading to a period where the church was a mixed congregation before becoming a predominantly African American church.",Joy Holland,SYMPOSIUM ON UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION (SOURCE),05/14/2020,https://scholar.valpo.edu/cus/909/,Abstract and biographical information and presentation download for Joy Holland's A Changing Church: A History of St. John’s Lutheran Church.,,,A Changing Church: A History of St. John’s Lutheran Church
17112,HB-263332-19,"This paper discusses the contributions of Howard University scholars to debates on the race problem, and their own efforts to address the geopolitics of knowledge during the 1930s-1940s.  By the 1930s, Howard had assembled a critical mass of stellar black intellectuals, part of what DuBois termed the Talented Tenth.  In the midst of turbulent years in American race relations, Howard scholars not only sought to practice socially relevant social science and advance a public intellectual model by linking their scholarship and teaching with intellectual activism, they aimed to put in place an institutional architecture that embodied the commitment to using interdisciplinary social science, global perspectives, and transcultural forms of knowledge to inform social action.  The Howard scholars initiated a series of annual conferences, lectures and forums intended to institutionalize an approach to American race relations that was situated in the politics of global anti-colonialism, and that presented race and class as inextricably intertwined.  It was through these institutional spaces that this cohort of radical black scholar-activists engaged the national and global public around the salient issues of the day, and forged meaningful personal and professional networks cemented in a world-spanning, transcultural community.",Krista Johnson,American Sociological Assocation,08/10/2020,,,,,Pioneering the Social Sciences at the Periphery

Now memorialized as the negotiator of the United Nations partition of Palestine, it  will come as a surprise to most that Bunche initially advanced a binational solution to the Jewish question and the question of Palestine, over that of partition.  As Alex Lubin has argued, Bunche's thinking/position, in the 1930s and early 1940s, aligned with a group of Afro-Arab and Jewish intellectuals and activists who  embraced a politics of binationalism (or anti nationalism) that recognized the multinational possibilities of the land of Palestine and pushed back against the rise of new ethnic-nationalisms during the global upheavals of the interwar era.  (Lubin, 2014).  However, the potent counter-discourse of binationalism was quickly muted by anti colonial nationalisms and a formidable discourse of national sovereignty.  Partition, an idea originally conceived after WWI as part of a new type of imperial governance in the guise of internationalism, after 1945, seemed to offer a quick and efficient exit strategy while maintaining the possibility of continued post colonial influence for Britain.","Sara Swetzoff, Krista Johnson",,11/19/2020,,,,,"Ralph Bunche, Binationalism and the Partition of Palestine"

17125,PW-253826-17,"The American Prison Writing Archive (APWA) is the largest and first fully searchable digital archive of non-fiction essays by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside. The APWA currently hosts 2,168 essays, or over 2.8 million words of direct prison witness. This is a word count equal to one quarter of the entire known corpus of slave narrative; the APWA echoes that corpus by bringing first-person voices forward to resist constructed misrepresentation of the subjects of an institution committed to legally sanctioned violence.  Like slave narrators, authors in the APWA help us to measure and thus to ask (again), What is the cost in human suffering of the current legal order?   This paper will briefly review the creation of an analog collection project that evolved into the APWA when essays kept coming after the deadline, forcing a break beyond analog print and onto a digital platform.  The paper will point to the ethical implications of clicking onto scanned pages composed by writers who testify to the human experience of the gravitational center of the law's violence, the center of the same legal horizon upon which the reader sits and that is revealed by reading prison witness.  It will also address an ethical hazard raised by digital methods: The APWA's scale, addressed with computational aids, makes it possible to atomize and re-datify the work of writers seeking to extract themselves—as individuals with full human dignity—from among the data piles of social science and the mass-scale prison.  Drawing upon graphic models offered by Darwin and Koebler—by way of Franco Moretti—the paper will describe a text analysis plan that both respects the integrity of each prison witness, and helps readers understand that these are witnesses who speak for the silenced inside the mass prison.",Doran Larson,"Law &amp; Society, 2020",5-29-20,https://lawandsociety.site-ym.com/default.aspx,virtual conference home page: 2020 Law &amp; Society Association Conference,,,From Witness to Archive: The Ethics of Digitizing First-Person Prison Testimony

I examine the account books, notebooks, and other handwritten documents of several merchant 'clans' to demonstrate how mercantile and clerical writing scripts, scribal and record keeping techniques, and even the material form of financial and political records shaped the look, shape, and 'feel' of literary 'books' in this period.

17238,AE-256242-17,"Funded by a two-year curricular development grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a team of two historians and one biologist at Dean College has created and implemented two courses that bring historical pedagogy into the science laboratory. Although we aimed for these courses to serve majors in science and medical fields, we chose to embed them within the general education curriculum, in order to create new learning opportunities for all students on campus. Dean is a four-year, private liberal arts institution in Franklin, MA, which attracts a diverse array of underserved student populations. Specifically, we developed the courses—one in the history of science and one in the history of medicine—during AY2017-2018 and then implemented them during AY2018-2019. They are fully integrated with laboratory instruction. The first course, ""History of Science,"" takes a general survey approach, both in lecture and lab, covering a variety of scientific disciplines. The second course, ""Beyond Henrietta Lacks,"" narrows the focus to issues of race and medicine in American history in lecture and to related scientific and medical concepts in a cell biology lab. In both courses, students attend a lecture (covering historical and scientific concepts) with an attached lab, in which they perform or simulate historical experiments. We hypothesize that this combination will improve student learning outcomes, learning experiences, and attitudes toward science. Using a variety of assessment instruments, we have generated a body of qualitative and quantitative data on student learning, experiences, and attitudes across the first year of this new general education curriculum, which we intend to share with colleagues through this paper.","David Brandon Dennis, Ph.D., R.A.

17239,AE-256242-17,"David Brandon Dennis I led a two-year NEH-funded project at Dean College to develop two integrative general education courses blending history of science and the history of medicine with a science lab.  In our assessment of the project we found that these courses significantly improved student experiences and attitudes toward science and history. I team-taught one of the courses (""History of Science"") with a biologist colleague. My role as project director allows me to speak to the experience of organizing and training faculty, mobilizing institutional resources, and integrating the new courses into our broader core curriculum.  Jessica Pisano Entering into our History of Science and Medicine integrating teaching project as the traditionally trained scientist, my first challenge was learning how to learn and think like a historian. As the member of the team who spanned both classes, I had the additional challenge of bridging not just ""two cultures"" but two colleagues. While time consuming, these two facets of the project have enhanced my teaching well beyond our integrated courses and continues to influence my development of a biology major at Dean College.    R.A. Lawson In our multi-year NEH-funded project, my role was to shape the cultural history investigations and narratives as relate to social factors such as ethnicity/race, gender, class, etc. I was therefore most involved in the creation of our history-biology dyad course, ""Beyond Henrietta Lacks: Race and Medicine in 20th Century America,"" which paired cultural history lectures with biology labs. Most exciting to me in this process—in addition to the rewarding collaboration with our consultants and my institutional colleagues—was inhabiting the space of the student-learner for the lab sessions, modeling genuine joy of learning alongside our students. The main challenge I experienced was the attempt to limit the scope of the course, because each subtopic inevitably led to a fascinating web of inquiry.","David Brandon Dennis, Ph.D., R.A.

Much of Sims' experimental work was accomplished by operating on enslaved women. The removal of the statue opened yet another chapter in the contemporary American struggle with race and historical memory—the intersection of slavery and medicine—while layering an important second theme: gender. Investigating the careers of Sims and other antebellum Gulf South medical practitioners—white, black, male, female—presents the human body and its medical treatment as a key battlefield for the working out of the social constructions of race and gender.

The history of American zoos, of course, have much to say about the history of conservation, animal history, historical ecology, the history of science and medicine, and evolutionary history as they, in turn, inform histories of nation-building, urbanization, and empire. Zoos, though, can also tell (bio) political stories. While zoogoers themselves rarely encountered politics along zoo footpaths, in the halls of Congress the ties that bound the National Zoo and its animals to politics proved more visible, especially when the topic of the zoo exploded into years of intense sectional debate in the House of Representatives. The National Zoological Park, as the only zoo in American history whose governance fell under the purview of the federal legislature, offers a unique window into a semiology that fused animals to debates about government that divided a nation through and after the Civil War. Animals were used by Congressmen to conjure sectional ideologies that could not be wielded as aggressively in an era of reconciliation.

17263,RA-50142-14,"Abstract: What are the essential formal qualities of socialism, and how may those forms be translated by migrants in new national-social contexts in which alternative economic values prevail? My study considers the intersecting careers of a cohort of entrepreneurial socialists who formed their beliefs and practiced their professions in the new republics of post-Habsburg Central Europe: the sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld, the architect Victor Gruen, and the artist-designer László Moholy-Nagy. Having come of age during the period of interwar socialist experimentation in Vienna, Budapest, and Berlin, they arrived in the U.S. as refugees from Nazism during the New Deal era of the 1930s, a time of extraordinary openness to social-democratic thinking. While the critical theorists of Max Horkheimer's Institute of Social Research—Lazarsfeld's fellow exiles at Columbia University—have become known to intellectual historians as the chief antagonists of twentieth-century consumer capitalism, the émigrés I consider in this project became the unlikely avatars of European-style social democracy in the ""free enterprise"" culture of American business. They interpreted the research methods, pedagogical techniques, and urban values they had acquired in a social-democratic cultural context for the American system. Their socialistic Weltanschauung was fundamental, I argue, to some of their most important works in the U.S., including the suburban shopping center, the ""focus"" group, and a new Bauhaus school of design in Chicago.",Joseph Malherek,Institute for Advanced Study,10/30/2019,https://events.ceu.edu/2019-10-30/frankfurt-schools-other-socialist-emigres-who-made-capitalist-culture-america-1918-1956,Website page for presentation at CEU (Central European University),,,"The Frankfurt School’s Other: Socialist Émigrés Who Made Capitalist Culture in America, 1918–1956"

17612,AKB-260507-18,"I argue that through the labor studies of economic equality, immigration policies, social activism, and global trade, students and faculty will understand themselves as part of a greater historical context. Long-term, faculty will retain this knowledge and new educational resources to incorporate labor perspectives into all standard courses of art and design.  Between 2015 and 2017, 46 small or mid-size galleries, reputable in the field, went out of business in New York while demand for contemporary work has risen five-fold since 2000. Despite growth in the total amount of sales, only 25 artists are responsible for almost half of all postwar and contemporary art auction sales. In 2017, work by this small group of elite artists sold for a combined $1.2 billion—44.6 percent of the $2.7 billion total generated by all contemporary public auction sales worldwide. Teaching the reality of business in contemporary art is not easy. Historical precedents and contemporary practices are traceable in primary sources, but students rarely relate them to their own future. Project-based learning initiatives with in-depth interviews with artists in their studios are designed to address issues such as changing conditions of primary and secondary markets; demise of small or mid-size galleries; rise of public art; growing business expenses; choices made by artists as alternatives to a gallery system; amending a standard gallery contract; transformation of an artist's careers; monopoly of few giant galleries; demographic changes of collectors; and other crucial perspectives. 360 videos of artist studios scattered around New York City's boroughs were produced to engage students with work conditions of professional artists of our own time.

Tracking individuals from census to census has been difficult, particularly if their color or race was not noted or perceived differently by different census-takers; some were wary of using their real names or did not know their ages; and some moved frequently, in the upheaval of the American Civil War or Reconstruction. Current systems are unable to record or search for the existence of a person without knowledge of their name (e.g., with a fuzzy identifier such as ""he has a brother that was a sailor""). To date, we have identified about 10,000 families of these African North American border-crossers—but, as we clean and refine the data, we are finding many false positives as well as many missing individuals.  In our database in progress, we have been matching individuals across the U.S. and Canadian censuses, and then tracking and visualizing the patterns of migration and the nodes of social, professional, religious, and educational networks for African North Americans in New York and Ontario via analysis in Excel and Tableau, with a SQL database in preparation. Once we have linked records, we propose using geographic-information-system (GIS) and network analysis tools, including Gephi, MapStory, and ""geo-Gephi"" layout programs, to visualize the connections between African North Americans and their routes of migration, as well as a system based on a system of uniform identification to track African North Americans in disparate archival and census data.",Adam Arenson,"Enslaved Conference, Michigan State University",3/8/2019,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BryJM6KiMSY,,,,After the Underground Railroad: Tracking African North Americans across the U.S.-Canada Border in the Emancipation Generation
17631,FB-56857-13,"After Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, hundreds of African North Americans returned to fight for the U.S. Army, and thousands more returned to the United States in the decades that followed. Time in Canada gave African North Americans the power of comparison: When struggling for access to social and political participation and economic opportunity in the United States, these individuals had a reference point in British North America (Canada), a similar but distinct Anglo-American society with a different history of slavery, emancipation, and claims for equal rights.  This paper places African North American political actions, economic choices, and cultural arguments within a transnational context, placing their migration among the more familiar stories of African Americans. It suggests a new understanding of the source of political and cultural currents in U.S. history from the beginnings of the Underground Railroad to the death of the emancipation generation (roughly 1830-1920), including for prominent leaders such as Martin Delany, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and Mifflin Gibbs, as well as for nearly unknown figures traced in fraternal, church, veterans', and educational records.

17632,FB-56857-13,"U.S. Civil War pension files were applications to a quasi-judicial board, authorized by Congress to gauge the level of disability among veterans, and to find and document their dependents. Filled with notarized depositions and medical examinations, the files were evaluated by civil servants whose conclusions could be appealed within the Pension Bureau, changed by Congress, or challenged in the courts. The examiners made their decisions according to unwritten rules of evidence—but the record shows how often their findings were influenced by overlapping strictures of racism, classism, and Victorian morality. The fuzzy standards at play are especially evident in the pension files for African North Americans—those of African descent whose lives were redefined by spending time on both sides of the U.S.- Canada border before, during, and after the American Civil War—who fought in the U.S. Colored Troops. Crossing and re-crossing the border, often with family on both sides, the African North Americans had experience in two similar but distinct Anglo-American societies, with different histories of racism and the struggle for equal rights. This paper analyzes the lives revealed in African North American ""contested widow"" pension files, where multiple women filed competing claims to be a deceased soldier's spouse. The rulings turn on questions of proof: in the competing narratives of these women, and in the doubts of the pension officials, what standards of evidence should apply? What assumptions about human nature can be made, when documents are missing? These files reveal cases of alcoholism, infidelity, depression, and deceit, but they also suggest the complexity of race, law, standards of evidence, and memory in transnational lives constructed under two legal systems.",Adam Arenson,"Conference on Family and Justice in the Archives, Concordia University, Montreal",5/5/2019,https://chrs.uqam.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/programmation-re%CC%81sume%CC%81s.pdf,,,,"African North Americans Filing Contested-Widow Pensions: Family, Morality, and Proof Across the U.S-Canada Border"
17633,FB-56857-13,"Though stories of the Underground Railroad fascinate the public, the history of those crossing the U.S.-Canada borders after 1861, in either direction, has not received much scholarly attention. This essay is drawn from a book project on the emancipation generation of African North Americans—those who were alive at the time of the final U.S. emancipation in 1865 and who made a border crossing. The majority of African North Americans were illiterate, and only a few of the most prominent individuals left significant papers. To follow the movements and actions of African North Americans, I have pursued traces within Civil War pension files and the U.S. and Canadian censuses. In the Civil War pension files, veterans (or their survivors) describe their needs, submit to medical examinations, and provide documentation about their character, family structure, employment, and migration histories, often through depositions. Tracing the connections between those deposed, across pension files, reveal the networks of veterans and their families, across the international border. And, while U.S. Census forms ask no questions about temporary residence in another country, finding those African North American children marked as born in Canada in the U.S. Census allows me to track migrations, geographic clusters, and kinship networks. This project argues that recovering the networks of African North Americans can reveal transnational allegiances and the evolution of the U.S.-Canada border regions, from the era of U.S. Reconstruction and Canadian Confederation to the start of the Great Migration.",Adam Arenson,"American Philosophical Society conference, Philadelphia",6/6/2019,https://www.amphilsoc.org/networks-symposium-papers,,,,Mapping the Networks of African North Americans Hidden in U.S. Government Records: Cases from the Pension Files and the Censuses

2468,HK-50037-12,"Online digital humanities collections have grown rapidly in scope and significance over the past decade. Museums, archives, and libraries increasingly make their collections available on the Web. In spite of these successes, datasets created by individual researchers still see little dissemination or preservation. Researchers must see clear evidence that data sharing is worth their time and effort. They need to be convinced that data dissemination will further their career goals and contribute substantively toward knowledge creation (Harley et al., 2010). These challenges are deeply interrelated. Efficient aggregation and modeling of disparate collections can open new research opportunities that cross disciplinary boundaries (Onsrud and Campbell 2007).&#x0D; &#x0D; To reach the point where researcher data can be used by a wider community, datasets must have sufficient quality and documentation. To give context, data also need to be related and linked with shared concepts and with other datasets available on the Web. Doing all this requires effort. New skills, professional roles, and scholarly communication channels need to be created to meet the specific requirements of meaningful data sharing. This paper presents a model of ""data sharing as publication,"" where adapting existing workflows and norms of scholarly communication to the dissemination of structured data can increase professional acceptance of data sharing. Appropriate workflows that enhance datasets with Linked Open Data dissemination methods can align the needs of researchers with the rapidly-expanding capabilities of the Web of Data.

2489,HD-51222-11,"The Virtual Paul's Cross Project (vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu) uses visual and acoustic modeling software to recreate the appearance of Paul's Churchyard in 1622 and to explore the acoustic properties of this site for open-air preaching in the early modern period.  The process of developing this project has shifted attention from the early modern sermon as a printed or manuscript text to consideration of the sermon as a performance in a particular physical setting and before a specific congregation. Even though the surviving manuscripts or printed texts of these sermons provide access to the content of the performed text, they are at best memorial reconstructions of the actual text as delivered. Early modern sermons were composed in performance from notes to recall for the preacher his prior preparation, described by Walton in his Life of Donne as including choice and division of the text, gathering of quotes from the Church Fathers, and articulation and organization of major points.  This paper will focus on one way we can learn from traces that survive in sermon texts of earlier stages of the sermon's development and of the conditions of original performance, as provided by Donne's sermon for Gunpowder Day in 1622. This sermon contains sentence fragments that may be survivals of the notes Donne took with him into the pulpit, while the sentences around them suggest what Donne made of these notes in the process of his delivery.",John N Wall,"Renaissance Society of America annual meeting, San Diego, CA",04/06/2013,http://convention2.allacademic.com/one/rsa/rsa13/index.php?click key=1&amp;cmd=Multi+Search+Search+Load+Session&amp;session id=175404&amp;PHPSESSID=foev6us34982051cbvpq1v8a25,,,,Interpreting the Manuscript:  MS Royal 17.B.XX. and the Virtual Paul's Cross Project

2533,TW-50185-12,"My essay fashions an argument about the place and importance of women singers in Pakistan, as a way to understand the evolution of Pakistani culture and the impact of women on it. &#x0D; The female artists I will discuss represent the best hope for a secular and progressive Pakistan, and therefore, their lives and negotiations for recognition in a male-dominated culture must be highlighted. Thus, a contemporary concert featuring the internationally renowned female Sufi (sacred/mystic) singer Abida Parveen, raises questions about affect  and the politics of gender. Her appearance on stage, with her wild curly hair framing her manly face as she sways to the music she sings, the audience clapping and swaying along with her, celebrates the quest for divine love, through  a language steeped in earthly metaphors of what has could be variously interpreted as hetero or homoerotic desire. Juxtaposed with a closing shot  from a 1970 film featuring a song by playback singer Noor Jehan (another  major female singer of Pakistan),  shows a popular actress of that era, the voluptuous Firdaus, lip-syncing and dancing to Noor Jehan's famous song, ""Sun Wanjhali Di Meethri Taan"" (Listen to my beautiful flute""), as her earthly lover/beloved Ranjha plays in the foreground on his flute, his long hair and effeminate get-up the mark of a Sufi dervish (saint).  Such contrasting musical styles, the first representing the sacred, the second secular, raise questions regarding the place of music and female performers in Pakistani society:  If human love is a reflection of the divine, how can love songs be the mark of the devil? How can women as both objects of desire and desiring subjects, be sinful creatures as extremists looking to ban music and female performance insist?&#x0D; ",Fawzia Afzal-Khan,"International Federation of Theatre Research (IFTR) Annual Conference, Santiago de Chile",7/21/2012,,,,,"  Feminist Mediations:  From Melody Queen to Muslim Madonna: Pakistani Female Singers Mediating Secular and Sacred Space."

2675,HD-51222-11,"Auralization has become a valuable tool to explore the acoustics of spaces and activities that no longer exist. Generally, acoustical archaeology has explored a fairly limited number of sources in a space to determine specific acoustical aspects of the sound of the spaces and to separate intentionally designed acoustical phenomena from the often unintended effects of the architecture. We have expanded this technique to recreate the entire soundscape of a specific event, in this case John Donne's 1622 Gunpowder Plot sermon at Paul's Cross, outside St. Paul's Cathedral&#x0D; in London as it was prior to the fire of 1666. This work augments ambisonic auralization techniques with techniques borrowed from computeraided music composition and audio production to create an immersive acoustical environment for the purpose of exploring the experience of listeners at many positions in a crowd that can be varied in size in real time. The paper outlines the role of geometric acoustics modeling, realtime convolution, randomized and statistically-derived sound event triggers, and other techniques employed to auralize a soundscape that&#x0D; includes the sermon, crowd response, and the ambient sounds of pre-Industrial London.","John N.

The BHL portal can be searched by several access points including title, author, subject, and scientific name. But, what is largely hidden and entirely unsearchable are the millions of natural history illustrations found with the BHL books and journals. These visual resources which include drawings, paintings, photographs, maps and diagrams represent work by some of the finest botanical and zoological illustrators in the world, including the likes of John James Audubon, Georg Dionysus Ehret, and Pierre Redouté. Many of the illustrations are the first recorded descriptions of much of the world's biota, providing the scientific foundation for contemporary taxonomic research and conservation assessments. Some of them are the only verifiable resource about an organism and their existence on Earth due to changes in global climate patterns and rapid loss of natural habitat for many species.

3154,RA-50096-10,"In 1711, toward the end of the decade-long War of the Spanish Succession, the cathedral chapter of the archdiocese of Mexico published an impassioned account of its many displays of loyalty on behalf of Philip V. After almost two centuries of Habsburg rule, Philip V and his advisors were under no illusions that Spanish subjects would transfer their loyalty over easily from Carlos II and, for this reason, ordered constant public demonstrations of loyalty throughout the course of the war. Mexico City's cathedral chapter responded accordingly and opened its account with Psalm 62, verse 12: ""But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.""&#x0D; Using cathedral chapter and municipal council minutes and a large body of published sermons, this paper focuses on the secular and religious elite of Mexico City's attempts to stop the utterance of ""wicked things"" during the War of the Spanish Succession. Loyalty to the Habsburg house would prove hard to combat, as evidenced by several people arrested in Mexico for supposedly rooting for the Austrian Alliance. In order to combat disloyalty, the municipal council, cathedral chapter, and all of the city's convents organized a variety of public ceremonies in support of the Bourbon house, including masses and festivities honoring the birth of crown prince Louis I, funerary honors for fallen soldiers, and, finally, masses of thanksgiving marking Spain's imminent victory in 1711. Taken together, these commemorations helped to cast the Bourbon king as Spain's ""savior,"" a trope that would continue throughout the eighteenth century and shapes the historiography of the early modern Spanish Empire to this day.",Frances L.

3498,FA-57305-13,"In mid-July 1886 Sarah Bernhardt finally arrived to Buenos Aires via Rio de Janeiro, where spectators eagerly awaited her presence at a limited number of functions. Bernhardt had just missed the debut of the Creole drama Juan Moreira, previously presented as a pantomime and now enhanced with talking characters. For the next month and a half, news of both Bernhardt and Moreira appeared together in the Buenos Aires press. And it would be easy to imagine the prima donna attending any number of forms of popular entertainment during her stay, for her arrival coincided with the new spectacles of the Carlos Brothers (a U.S. circus family) and Frank Brown (an English clown), while the Italian showman Pablo Raffetto put on ""unauthorized"" version of Moreira. At the end of July Bernhardt left the capital and traveled north to Rosario, and then in August she acted in La Plata and completed her Rioplatense tour in Montevideo. &#x0D; &#x0D; Bernhardt's South American tour obviously tells us something about her fearlessness to brave Transatlantic travel. But beyond this quality of her character, her time in the Plata river region reveals a rich entertainment market whose performers followed a circuit including Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and, above all, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, and smaller towns along the tributary rivers leading to the Río de la Plata. The decade of 1880 was a moment of significant growth in the number of participants in this entertainment market, but by this time it already had a history half a century deep. This paper explores how hemispheric travelers contributed to the consolidation of this entertainment market beginning in the late 1820s, and the new forms of sociability that emerged in the process.&#x0D; ",William Acree,American Historical Association Annual Meeting,01/03/2014,,,,,"Hemispheric Travelers on the Rioplatense Stage, 1820-1886"

3552,FT-62126-14,"The 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the codification in paintings of ideal Indic heroines called nayikas, some of whom were based on earlier sculptural prototypes.  Defined in the visual arts by their conventional poses and motifs, these nayikas entered into a wide range of pictorial contexts, including illustrations of poetic and devotional texts and the pages of Mughal albums, called muraqqa, which combined painting with beautifully calligraphed texts. The Indic nayika joined European, Persian, and Mughal female ideals in a richly varied repertoire of types, which painters would continue to draw on well into the 19th and 20th centuries. Related to this phenomenon was a growing profusion of portraits that pictured elite Mughal and Rajput men with beautiful women, some of them types and some possibly representing wives or mistresses. Focusing on the Indic nayika, this paper examines her aesthetic and social significance in the early years of her codification, especially in relation to the broader proliferation of pictures of female beauties. Particular attention is given to the production and reception of nayika imagery in domains of elite social pleasure, where she would have been surrounded with poetry, music, dance, food and drink, friendship, and love. The paper builds on recent scholarship that understands the Mughal and Rajput worlds to have been mutually constitutive, and on a growing dialogue between South Asian art history and cultural studies, while addressing the need for more sustained theorization of the central place of gender in the visual arts of the Mughal era.",Molly Emma Aitken,Association for Asian Studies (AAS),3/27/2015,http://www.asian-studies.org/conference/,Conference website,,,Picture Perfect: Indic Heroines in Mughal Society

My current research considers those African North Americans who crossed the U.S.-Canada borders after 1861, in either direction. I have pursued research in family trees, at homecoming gatherings, in Civil War pension files, archaeology and the built environment, and the U.S. and Canadian censuses. This project argues that recovering the networks of African North Americans reveals the evolution of the U.S.-Canada border regions; the historical relationships between race, citizenship, national allegiances; and the motivations for international and interregional migration, 1860-1930.  I am researching the effect of repeat migration on the African North American communities throughout the Great Lakes (including Buffalo/Niagara Falls); in large cities such as Toronto, Washington, Boston, and New York; from the Eastern Canada maritime provinces; and from British Columbia. I have preliminary evidence that African North Americans were the leaders in the key Black organizations around the Great Lakes—churches, businesses, schools, labor unions, and fraternal organizations—when the Great Migration brought huge numbers of African Americans from the South to transform these communities. The research proposed here could determine whether African North Americans were more likely to lead these communities.",Adam Arenson,"National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom (NTF) Program training, Niagara Falls",9/13/2019,https://asalh.org/underground-railroad-training/eventschedule/,,,,After the Underground Railroad: Mapping the Networks of African North Americans
17636,FB-56857-13,"After Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, hundreds of African North Americans returned to fight for the U.S. Army, and thousands more returned to the United States in the decades that followed. Time in Canada gave African North Americans the power of comparison: When struggling for access to social and political participation and economic opportunity in the United States, these individuals had a reference point in British North America (Canada), a similar but distinct Anglo-American society with a different history of slavery, emancipation, and claims for equal rights. This paper places African North American political actions, economic choices, and cultural arguments within a transnational context, placing their migration among the more familiar stories of African Americans. It suggests a new understanding of the source of political and cultural currents in U.S. history from the beginnings of the Underground Railroad to the death of the emancipation generation (roughly 1830-1920), including for prominent leaders such as Martin Delany, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and Mifflin Gibbs, as well as for nearly unknown figures traced in fraternal, church, veterans', and educational records.

In the fast fashion trends represented by the H&amp;M, Zara, and Forever 21 and the like, consumers are now more aware of ethical and environmental consequences as well as socio-economic injustices stemming from their purchases.   Labor strikes out of textile mills and clothing factories in the twentieth century have much studied in the context of labor organizations but not in the context of business history of careers in art and design. Some contemporary artists comment on the disappearance of artisanal villages or traditional communities in Southeast Asia or China.

In this paper we explore entity recognition for Coptic, the language of Hellenistic era Egypt in the first millennium CE. We evaluate a number of standard Natural Language Processing approaches to the problem and lay out the difficulties in applying them to a low-resource, morphologically complex language. We present our own solutions for named and non-named nested entity recognition and entity linking, relying on a robust parsing strategy, feature-based CRF models, and some hand-crafted knowledge base resources, which enable high accuracy entity recognition with orders of magnitude less data than commonly used for NER.

In this paper, I discuss how work on language documentation and revitalization can inform studies of a language's history, and vice versa, drawing on my experience with Eskaleut (EA) and in particular of Unangam Tunuu (UT), formerly known as Aleut. On a project to document UT and create adult language learning materials, I had to describe UT morphosyntax in sufficient detail for language learners; in so doing, I discovered substantial heretofore unidentified differences between UT and Yupik/Inuit languages, such as in strategies for combining words, or for expressing causation. These, in turn, led me to investigate differences between Yupik/Inuit languages and UT more systematically, and to explore the possibility of prehistoric language contact as a source of these differences. In looking at borrowing patterns between UT and the neighboring Yupik language Alutiiq, I discovered gaps in the documentation of place naming strategies, making it difficult to establish the origins and meanings of place names, despite excellent collections of place names themselves, and despite community prioritization of indigenous names, including the creation of new names.

17693,HAA-266472-19,"Building science gateways for humanities content poses new challenges to the science gateway community. Compared with science gateways devoted to scientific content, humanities-related projects usually require 1) processing data in various formats, such as text, image, video, etc., 2) constant public access from a broad audience, and therefore 3) reliable security, ideally with low maintenance. Many traditional science gateways are monolithic in design, which makes them easier to write, but they can be computationally inefficient when integrated with numerous scientific packages for data capture and pipeline processing. Since these packages tend to be single-threaded or nonmodular, they can create traffic bottlenecks when processing large numbers of requests. Moreover, these science gateways are usually challenging to resume development on due to long gaps between funding periods and the aging of the integrated scientific packages. In this paper, we study the problem of building science gateways for humanities projects by developing a service-based architecture, and present two such science gateways: the Moving Image Research Collections (MIRC) – a science gateway focusing on image analysis for digital surrogates of historical motion picture film, and SnowVision - a science gateway for studying pottery fragments in southeastern North America. For each science gateway, we present an overview of the background of the projects, and some unique challenges in their design and implementation. These two science gateways are deployed on XSEDE's Jetstream academic clouding computing resource and are accessed through web interfaces. Apache Airavata middleware is used to manage the interactions between the web interface and the deep-learning-based (DL) backend service running on the Bridges graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster.","Zhou, Jun, Karen Smith, Greg Wilsbacher, Paul Sagona, David Reddy, Ben Torkian",Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing: PEARC '20,07/28/2020,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3311790.3396628,AMC Digital Library,,,Building Science Gateways for Humanities

17735,RZ-249831-16,"The emergence on the Inner Asian steppe of regional confederacies, states, and empires of pastoral nomads has figured prominently in the early historical records of China. To date, more than eighty years of systematic research on pastoral nomads has produced a substantial amount of data for understanding these mobile societies. Although this effort on the part of historians and prehistorians represents an impressive body of knowledge, relatively little attention has been devoted to anthropological models for complex socio-political organization among pastoral nomadic groups, despite the clear significance of nomadic peoples to civilizations in both the Old and New Worlds. In paper, I present a hypothesis-based research design to advance the understanding of regional nomadic complexity using as a case study the archaeology of Mongolia's first nomadic state, the Xiongnu polity (c. 3rd century BC). Employing the results of recent archaeological studies in 3 different areas of Mongolia, our research evaluates current competing models for the process of political integration that articulated central and local powerholders in the earliest phases of state building. Our research assesses hypotheses for decentralized and centralized state expansion derived from the historical and archaeological records. We argue that what was, at first, a core polity based on distributed authority became more centralized through the experience of integrating outlying communities. These two foundational formats of authority provided the mature Xiongnu state with the capacity to shift between more and less centralized leadership allowing for a more flexible form of regional polity. The Dornod Mongol Survey project (DMS) proposes to evaluate these ideas using regional pedestrian survey and excavation over a three year period at the site of Avargyn Ovoo in the southeastern Gobi desert of Mongolia.","Honeychurch, W","Invited paper presented at the “International Association for Mongol Studies Third Asian Conference.” National Museum of Korea, Seoul, Korea.",10/20/2019,,,,,"Where are the slab burials?

In 1996, the National Park Service proclaimed it ""the cradle of American culture,"" leading to its 2009 Congressional designation as the Mississippi Delta National Heritage Area (MDNHA). In 2012, the National Trust for Historic Preservation deemed it a National Treasure because ""the Delta tells many of the nation's diverse stories"" including the Blues and the Civil Rights Movement.    The Delta also is the poorest region in the poorest state in the U.S. Institutionalized systems of oppression, inequality, and racial violence against African American residents have produced persistent, generational poverty conditions. The Delta's renowned cultural heritage assets were created through African American experience. Yet, African Americans generally are not empowered to interpret their own stories, raising concerns about heritage tourism authenticity and representation.  The Delta Center for Culture and Learning at Delta State University and the MDNHA are inclusive, collaborative cultural heritage development catalysts in the region.

17843,FT-270920-20,"After collaborating on several short films in the 1970s, Merata Mita gained international recognition for her feature films including ""Patu!"" and ""Mauri."" By the nineties, however, Mita returned to the genre of short-format documentaries that marked her early career, including ""The Shooting of Dominick Kaiwhata"" (1993), which examines the fatal shooting of a young Black Power member and the resulting miscarriage of justice that followed, as well as ""Dread"" (1996), which explores a small community of Maori Rastafarians on the North Island. Furthermore, Mita created these short documentaries for broadcast television, which has led to their exclusion from the canon of global Indigenous cinema – deemed the ""fourth cinema"" by Maori filmmaker Barry Barclay, and a body of work ""outside the national orthodoxy"" that Mita herself helped to establish.   Yet Mita's embrace of television as a platform to broadcast her politically engaged works in the nineties provided the necessary context for the establishment of Maori Television in 2004 – now a key site for the health and well-being of Maori language and culture in the face of the devastating effects of colonial settlement. By reconsidering fourth cinema as a mode of exhibition as much as it is a category of production, Mita's willingness to produce significant works for her community via television – instead of for exclusive exhibition at art house theaters – reveals one of Mita's key contributions to Indigenous film and media. That is, not only did she make the national airwaves more hospitable to Indigenous voices, she also demonstrated to Indigenous media-makers worldwide that working ""outside the national orthodoxy"" is not necessarily exploiting the globally circulating product of film, but perhaps embracing a locally based medium to cross (and redefine) the internal borders of the contemporary settler nation.",Leah Vonderheide,MLA International Symposium: Being Hospitable: Languages and Cultures Across Borders (acceptance pending),07/17/2021,,,,,Before Maori Television: The internal border-crossing of Merata Mita’s made-for-TV documentaries

17981,PD-266994-19,"The Naduhup language family, located in northwest Amazonia, has four members: Hup, Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadëb, of which Nadëb is the most distantly related sister (Epps &amp; Bolaños 2017). Despite a strong signal of cognacy in basic vocabulary, the four languages are highly divergent in their grammatical profiles and morphological forms – particularly so for Nadëb. This divergence probably has much to do with their diverse contact histories, and has likely been facilitated by structural properties that feed grammaticalization, such as noun incorporation and verb serialization. This structural divergence is clearly evident in argument marking across the four languages. In light of the diversity of its argument marking resources, the Naduhup family offers an intricate historical puzzle in its own right, which in turn provides insights into the diachrony of argument marking more generally. Despite their apparent recency, the historical sources of the core argument markers are not fully clear; however, those in Hup and Nadëb may represent an extension of directional and locational functions, respectively. For non-core arguments, the development of a more generic oblique suffix (-Vt) in Hup and Yuhup has probably been areally motivated via contact with Tukanoan languages (see Aikhenvald 2002 for a similar development in Tariana, Arawakan), and may derive from hut, a variant still attested in Yuhup. Similarly, Nadëb's development of pronominal subject-marking is a likely reflection of contact, involving Arawakan languages. Several postpositions show some evidence of cognacy across the family, while others may be innovations, although there is little evidence for non-adpositional sources. Finally, Nadëb has undergone a further historical stage in which the incorporation of a number of postpositions into the verb phrase has given rise to a set of verbal prefixes (see Weir 1986).",Patience Epps,"Workshop on Diachrony, Adpositions, Nuclear and Oblique Arguments (University of Sonora)",11/12/2020,,,,,The diachrony of argument marking in Naduhup (NW Amazonia).
17982,PD-266994-19,"Nadëb (Naduhup language family) stands out among other northern Amazonian languages for its large vowel inventory, which distinguishes ten contrastive vowels, at least seven of which contrast for length. The analysis of the vowel inventory has changed little since Helen Weir's (1984) initial work. Recent pilot fieldwork, however, has identified a new vowel contrast previously unaccounted for. This contrastive vowel is problematic with respect to our understanding of the Nadëb phonological system – it only manifests as long, while other vowels manifest as both long and short or only short, and consultants cannot identify a short equivalent. Moreover, preliminary formant analyses suggests that its central tendency is near-identical to that of another vowel, /??/; most words that attest this vowel are written as /??/ or /??/ in other works on Nadëb (Martins 2005, Barbosa 2005, Weir et al. 2011). The lack of an orthographic representation for this vowel is troubling for the community, who have an active bilingual school and prioritize an effective orthography. I propose that /?:/ is best analyzed phonologically as a long /?:/ (note that [?:] does not occur in contemporary Nadëb), which has raised and merged phonetically with /?:/, phonemically /?:/. Due in part to morphological patterns, speakers still perceive /?:/ and /?:/ as separate phonemes.",Mark Simmons,Conference on Indigenous Languages of Latin America – IX (UT Austin),10/10/2019,,,,,Phonological re-analysis: Classifying a problematic vowel in Nadëb

Mapping Senufo—an in-progress, collaborative, born-digital publication project—offers a model for joining such theories with research and publication practice. It focuses on arts identified as Senufo, one of the most celebrated styles of African art since the early twentieth century. The project reflects our commitment to taking seriously the long-established understanding that a marker of identity, like the labeling of an art style or knowledge itself, is historically constituted, fluid, and positional. In its final form, the open-access, multimodal publication the Mapping Senufo team will produce will exemplify the contingent nature of identities, art style labeling, and knowledge production. It will also harness the interactivity of digital environments to render readers active participants in knowledge construction. In this presentation, we will examine how our initial efforts to map geographic locations linked to objects labeled as Senufo led us and the rest of the project team to reframe research questions, reevaluate sources, and reimagine the form of a digital monograph.

First, high-attention, high-control actions don't seem to heighten awareness of one's beliefs. Second, low-attention, low-control actions are caused by the same states at play when executing high-attention, high-control actions, in which case there is no ontological difference in the states involved in these behaviors. Third, on Zimmerman's view it is unclear what it is for a state to be involved in behaviors at all, as the basic realist response—that beliefs cause behavior—is unavailable to a Zimmerman-style pragmatist.

Thus modern ""associative"" models end up being no more ontologically parsimonious than their rivals. In which case associationism faces a dilemma: either it is truly simple, but also descriptively inadequate, or it is not ontologically parsimonious and thus is no better off than rival theories which posit propositional structure.",Eric Mandelbaum,"Varieties of Minds, University of Cambridge",7/7/18,,,,,The Simplest Model of Mind

Developments with STEAM (Art), STREM (Reading), and STEMM (Music) have tried to address this by adding arts and humanities into STEM to increase problem solving, innovation, or creativity. This supplement leaves out many of the soft-skill development that arts and humanities provide. In a change of this approach, the Honors College at Texas Tech University has developed humanities-driven STEM courses that use arts and humanities as the basis of discussion of human progress and supplements with STEM principles through scientific discovery and engineering advancement.

18096,PW-259116-18,"Some Mixtec varieties of the Coastal dialect group (Josserand 1983) are relatively vital and have been documented and described, whereas others are not. One of these, Tu'un Savi, or Tututepec Mixtec, is spoken by relatively few people and has not been well-studied, even though history suggests it may have been influential in the past. The town of San Pedro Tututepec is built on the former capital of the Mixtec-speaking Yuku Dzaa empire that controlled much of the coastal region of what is now Oaxaca from the Late Post-Classic period until after the Conquest (Spores 1993). This paper presents a brief sketch of Tututepec Mixtec as represented in historical and archival sources with an eye to identifying traits that distinguish it from other Coastal Mixtec languages that are more prominent in the literature. In particular, evidence will be shown pointing to Tututepec Mixtec sharing more features with Chayuco Mixtec (Pensinger 1974)  than with other nearby Mixtec languages such as Jamiltepec and San Juan Colorado Mixtec (Johnson 1988; Stark, Johnson &amp; Lorenzo 1986). These sources include a wordlist (Belmar 1902; Sullivant 2015) and responses to linguistic surveys undertaken in the 1970s (Josserand n.d.). This sketch of Tututepec Mixtec will identify phonological, morphological, and lexical traits of the language that will be useful for the study of the historical development of the Mixtec languages and variation across the Coastal Mixtec languages.  It is hoped that this initial sketch made possible by studies of previously collected by underanalyzed data will draw attention to this language and its position in the constellation of Mixtec languages of the Coastal group and possible historical influence across Oaxaca's Pacific coast. This work has the potential to bring attention to the Tu'un Savi speech community of Tututepec and may spur further research on this language or other languages it may have been in contact with it historically.",Ryan Sullivant,Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas,2020-01-03,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cWn3jHA6cMFjONgfuVmQVpIzDVjl6JpCb LOUIC3nQ0/edit?usp=sharing,Public Google Slides link,,,A sketch of Tututepec Mixtec based on 20th century historical sources
18109,RQ-260871-18,"Sounding Spirit is a collaborative research lab and publishing project that demonstrates the importance of sacred texts to the singers and communities who shape American music history and experience. This sectional will highlight the impact and legacy of five significant tunebooks in the Sounding Spirit series: Cherokee Singing Book (1846); The Story of the Jubilee Singers with Their Songs (1875); Class, Choir, and Congregation (1888); Soul Echoes, No. 2 (1909); and Original Sacred Harp (1911). These volumes represent periods, places, and genres that illustrate the importance of vernacular songbooks to American sacred music. These tunebooks also document dynamic encounters among white, black, and native communities whose singing and worship are often represented as discrete. In addition to sharing selections from these songbooks, Sounding Spirit editor-in-chief Jesse P. Karlsberg will co-present with the project's volume editors on the significance of gospel, spirituals, and shape-note songbooks to both the history and practice of sacred song.

To explain the analogy and show why it spoke so powerfully to her readers and herself, I will set the book in context and show how Addams constructed the analogy using then current theories of child development and aesthetics.

From the 1960-80s, Black women across captured lands such as Australia, Aotearoa, Fiji, Vanuatu and New Caledonia battled these scourges through Black Power, decolonization and women's movements. In struggle, they raised arms, consciousness, rifles, liberation flags, families, questions about gender, spirits, instruments, solar panels, farms, cups of kava, resources, deities, voices and pens alike.&#x0D; &#x0D; In the 1970s, Pacific nuclear testing struck at the heart of these issues.

NFIP clearly recognized the connections between colonialism and ecological injustice—the jellyfish baby makers tested nuclear weapons in the region because colonized Black people populated it. As such, the region could only become environmentally healthy by regaining political sovereignty. Evoking the name of a Tongan war club, NFIP's newspaper Povai became a regional voice for decolonization.

3665,FB-57633-14,"Italian opera in the late nineteenth century increasingly became identified in the United States as a musical-theatrical option that was elite and exclusive, especially as the nouveau riche of the 1870s and 1880s embraced opera as an opportunity for the ostentatious display of wealth. Middle-class Americans—who had happily and regularly patronized opera performances from the 1840s through the 1860s—were increasingly alienated by these ""aristocratic"" pretentions. The American prima donna Emma Abbott recognized this when she returned from Europe in 1876 following several years of musical training. Thoroughly educated in the Italian school of operatic performance in Milan and Paris, Abbott realized that many middle-class Americans still wished to support opera in English, and she decided to address that need. She created a public persona that resonated with the American public: as a moral and upstanding Christian, an apple-pie and approachable American from the heartland (with roots in Yankee New England), and a singer who gave her audiences what they wanted, which was the Italian repertory in translation, performed well but unpretentiously, and offered at affordable prices. The astonishing success of her company (1879-1891) is a little-known but important story of the creation of a middle-class audience for continental opera in the United States that helps us to understand better American musical culture (in general) during the 1870s and 1880s.",Katherine K.

My focus will be a little-known English-opera movement that flourished in America during the second half of the century, starting with the revival of English opera in the immediate post-war period. Significant changes in the American opera audience (as a direct result of the economic crisis of the 1870s) helped to set the stage for the significant English-opera movement that emerged in the 1880s, the heyday of English-opera performance in the United States. I will examine in some detail several important troupes, including the Caroline Richings, Euphrosyne Parepa Rosa, Clara Louise Kellogg, Emma Abbott, and Boston Ideals opera companies. The repertories of the final two troupes illustrate the two most popular strands of vernacular opera during the 1880s: the Abbott company performed translations of continental works (as well as some operas written in English); the Ideals relied on comic opera and operetta (in particular the extraordinarily popular works of Gilbert and Sullivan). These companies—and scores of other English-language troupes active in America during this period—featured singers (including Americans) who were active on both sides of the Atlantic; they also attracted non-elite middle-class American audiences with repertories that likewise represent a shared trans-Atlantic culture. &#x0D; &#x0D; ",Katherine K.

3754,HD-51709-13,"This presentation reports on the phase of the Jubilees Palimpsest Project dedicated to the integration of spectral imaging technology and reflectance transformation imaging technology (RTI). In 2013–2014 the National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities funded a collaboration of scientists and scholars of early Jewish literature to develop a method for integrating two previously successful technologies. The combination is greater than the sum of the sum of the parts because the data is fully registered, meaning each pixel represents the same location on the object across the data set. As the data set grows the possibilities for processing grow exponentially. The two technologies integrated capitalize on two features of erased manuscripts (palimpsests) that offer hope for recovery of textual information. First, the erasure of ink is typically not complete. The difficulty is more often in distinguishing the erased ink from the similar shades of brown surrounding it. Spectral imaging uses nine or more discrete wavelengths of light, both outside and more precisely within the color resolution of the human eye. This significant quantity of data can be processed and mapped to false-colors within the human range of color perception. The second area of hope for recovery of textual information from erased manuscripts results from the effect of acidic ink on the texture of parchment. Even if the ink has been entirely washed away it may be nevertheless be possible to distinguish where ink had been because of the rougher texture. RTI uses light reflected from many angles to identify the orientation of any one pixel, such that the texture of an imaged object can be visualized and enhanced in an interactive viewer. The integration of these technologies means that a scholar can see both the chrominance and texture features of an object at the same time.",Todd R.

3775,AQ-51123-14,"This presentation is about developing and teaching an interdisciplinary course with support from an  NEH Enduring Questions award for a project that asks, ‘What is peace?  The course under development examines notions of peace in eastern and western contexts from ancient to modern periods with the ambition to push back against stereotyped images of ‘peaceniks.'  Nuances of its meanings conjoin with notions of justice, violence, human dignity, social and political order, tolerance, or their lack. Because our institution, the University of North Georgia, is one of six  senior military colleges, though with a majority civilian student body, answers to the question of  peace have pressing, practical, and current implications for economics, social justice, and global conflict.","Renee A.

3793,AQ-50290-10,"Many thinkers, including Descartes, Francis Hutcheson, and Henri Bergson have commented on humor's corrective function, especially where ""small vices"" or ""mechanical inelasticity"" are concerned.  Contemporary academics like, Rachelle Berg et. al., describe the therapeutic value of humor in ""forming a therapeutic bond, addressing resistance, reframing maladaptive beliefs, and replacing rigid, self-absorbed perspectives"" (2009).  Frank Lachmann has discussed the valuable place of humor in working with adults suffering from narcissism or self-pathology (2007).  These insights can be magnified when we examine the connection between humor and friendship, specifically the way that part of friendship is edifying confrontation.  Where there is confrontation, humor can have a unique power to persuade one toward a healthier way of living.  An incident in C.S. Lewis's work The Great Divorce demonstrates this power, while also showing its limitations.  Humor cannot guarantee or force a particular outcome; it is a tool of humble persuasion.  Finally, part of the value of humor's humble persuasion is how it honors wonder.  For those trapped in self-absorbed perspectives, narcissism, or any form of persistent willful blindness, humor's delightful invitation to wonder may free those who are trapped thereby.",Shawn Tucker,International Congress of Humanities and Social Science Research,07/24/2012,,,,,Humor's Humble Persuasion
3794,AQ-50290-10,"In March of 2010, I was notified that I was a recipient of a National Endowment for the Humanities Grant given by the United States' government.  The grant is called an ""Enduring Questions"" grant.  It supports the development of a new course that addresses an ""Enduring question.""  My course addresses the nature of Pride, Humility, and the Good Life.  This presentation offers some of the fruitful results of teaching this course.  The presentation is divided into two parts.  The first part of the presentation includes a discussion of the content that we have explored in the course.  The course draws from classical authors like Homer and Virgil as well as other writers like Lao Tzu, Dante, Ralph Ellison, and Arthur Miller.  We also examine works by philosophers like Aristotle, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, and Buber.  In addition to this discussion of the course's content, the second part of this presentation will explore some concrete teaching techniques and tools that seem particularly valuable.  Those tools include a daily writing assignment called a QCQ, another assignment using Google Forms, a new approach to exams, and a scaffolded research project.  These unique, innovative teaching tools made the course content come alive for the students.",Shawn Tucker,"4th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation ",11/15/2011,,,,,"Content and Teaching Tools for an Interdisciplinary Humanities Course on Pride, Humility, and the Good Life"
3795,AQ-50290-10,"Both Willy Lowman and Michael Scott exhibit traits associated with secondary narcissism.  Both, though in different ways, have difficulty with empathy, problems distinguishing themselves from others, a hypersensitivity to insults, and are vulnerable to shame rather than guilt.  Both also exhibit flattery towards those they admire and who affirm them, use people without concern for the costs, brag, and pretend to be more important than they really are.  One of the ways that many of these traits come through is in their inability to hear others unless they are saying what they want to hear.  This presentation will explore how the structure (and outcome) of Death of a Salesman makes Willy's narcissism tragic, while Michael's parallel pathology is structure to seem comic in The Office.",Shawn Tucker,Conference of the Humanities Education and Research Association,03/20/2012,,,,,"Death of a Branch Manager: Willy Lowman, Michael Scott, and the Tragicomedy of Narcissism"
3796,AQ-50290-10,"Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man provides an excellent ""cautionary tale"" of the potential pitfalls of pride and humility.  When the novel is approached, pedagogically, in this manner, what comes to the fore are the various attempts to find some cause or core to which the narrator can submit wholeheartedly.  The narrator mentions humility in his graduation speech, and seems committed to the idea of obedient submission to a higher cause.  In the course of the novel, every cause to which he tries to submit proves to be flawed, including the college, Mr. Norton, his job at Liberty Paints, and the Brotherhood.  He rejects or is forced to reject all of these causes or cores.  His attempts at humble submission prove futile and dangerous.  In the course of his rejections, his various forms of rebellion could be linked to pride. The clearest example of this comes when he feels compelled to leave the Brotherhood.  When he attempts to leave, his lack of submission is branded as arrogance and pride.  Another connection between the narrator and pride is the hubris, in the original Greek sense, of his sexual encounter with Sibyl.  When the book is presented or taught in this manner, it outlines the dangers inherent in different aspects of pride and humility.",Shawn Tucker,Conference of the Humanities Education and Research Association,03/17/2013,,,,,Teaching Ellison’s Invisible Man as a Cautionary Tale of Pride and Humility

3818,HD-50176-07,"Architectural heritage represents the glorified past of the rich culture and architectural history of any country or community. It is important that the heritage be preserved and maintained for the generations to come so that they can learn from the heritage about their cultural identities as well as their architectural history. One of the essential approaches in preservation of architectural heritage is documentation of 3D geometries and surface textures of historical buildings. However, precise colour information, irrespective of lighting effects, which is an intrinsic property of the surface materials of building interiors and exteriors, has not been accurately documented in the scale of whole building surfaces, except for small sample areas. Every day the materials of historical buildings are decaying and their colours are fading. The goal of this project is to develop a method to assist in recording and documenting the intrinsic chromaticity information of building interiors and exteriors of architectural heritage with low cost and high efficiency. The method takes advantage of the emerging High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDRI) technology, which can store rich information about colour and illumination through digital photography. The significance of this research lies in that by recording the colour information, in addition to the geometry and texture information that can be obtained through other technologies, we can achieve more complete documentation for architectural heritage. In this paper, we present an overview of the problem and our effort of utilizing the advances in computer vision to document the colour information of architectural heritage.","Wei Yan, Pankaj Rajan",The Conference on Virtual Systems and MultiMedia (VSMM) '08,10/20/2008,http://www.vsmm2008.org,Conference Website,,,Towards Digitizing Colours Of Architectural Heritage

In our course ""What is Memory?"" we read and write with Nabokov's life story using our own form of Gregory Ulmer's ""Mystory"" mode of writing as a way to discover the life cycles of memories--ours and our students as well as those related by Nabokov--and to explore their tendencies to constellate around images, objects, and their metaphorical relations--the spiral, for instance. Following Ulmer, our Mystory is modeled after Roland Barthes' A Lover's Discourse. Like A Lover's Discourse, it is based on a ""tutor text"": A Lover's Discourse's tutor text is Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther; ours is Nabokov's Speak, Memory. Like A Lover's Discourse, our Mystory consists of a collection of ""figures,"" short open-ended compositions in which we write with and after Nabokov, weaving our responses to the autobiography with our own and each others' memories, including autobiographical and collective memories as well as memories of other texts. This ""weaving"" process is supported by our use of SCALAR (http://scalar.usc.edu/), a multi-modal web-authoring platform, as the environment for our collaborative work. Coupling the responsive Mystory mode of studying a memoir to the collaborative SCALAR writing environment facilitates students' appreciation of the similarities between life writing and story writing, thereby also helping them to recognize the activity of remembering as itself a creative process.","Martha Rust, Suzanne England",The Story of Memory: New Perspectives on the Relationship between Memory and Storytelling in the Twenty-First Century (sponsored by The Memory Network,09/04/2014,,,,,"“‘The circle, uncoiled, unwound’: Following Memory’s Storyline with Mystory” "

3909,RZ-51615-13,"(Disc)overing Race explores the intersections of digital history, geneaology, legal history, and computational technologies in uncovering the fragmentary histories of American families. Like oral histories and census records, legal records have long formed the archival substructure of the stories historians rely upon. Yet, legal records of the 19th century are often fragmentary---bits and pieces of the stories preserved in the official records---that must be supplemented with careful contextualization and related evidence. This paper explores the benefits and limitations of using computational approaches to categorizing, relating, and displaying these fragmentary records through an exploration of the O Say Can You See Project, an exploration of multigenerational black and white family networks in early Washington, D.C., that collects, digitizes, and analyzes over 4,000 case files from the D.C. court from 1808 to 1815. Attempting to document the relationships within and among black and white families in early D.C., the O Say Can You See Project offers novel ways to consider how we can interlink enslaved and free African Americans, as well as enslaved and white families through fragmentary records sources. This presentation focuses first on how digital tools allow us to tell multiplicities of histories that allow us to animate hidden, often fragmentary histories, of race, gender, and nineteenth century life and second on the multigenerational networks of families and their use of legal processes.","Jennifer Guiliano, William G.

French was supposed both to have suppressed English and then to have become ossified and degenerate in the late medieval ages, by being cut off from its 'national homeland'.  This paper looks at  medieval language acquisition and models of literacy, making the necessary distinctions between writing, reading and speaking in medieval language acquisition and models of literacy,and showing that late medieval women had important roles both in teaching, speaking and reading  French as well as being important commissioners and patrons of members of the clerical culture).   The oral culture of women, the use of French-language access in their primers and psalters and the linguistic phenomenology of late medieval French (in fact alive and changing) are one example of the continuing presence and importance of of French in later medieval England to set alongside other French-language practices in documentary and literary culture and suggest both the inadequacy of monoglot treatments of the vernacular and suggest some new cultural landscapes to integrate int our accounts of England's literate culture in the Middle Ages.",Jocelyn Wogan-Browne,"Center for Medieval Studies, Central European University, Budapest, Hungary",04/11/2014,,,,,"Multilingualism and Medieval England: Rethinking Language Learning and Literary """

Drawing upon new and extensive archival research, the paper maps out what was distinctive about Chicago's literary culture at this time—especially in comparison to Harlem.  It tells a story of interracial collaborations supported by the Works Progress Administration, and explores the question of how black writers conceived of an audience for their writing, when they were dependent upon white publishers.  Ultimately the paper puts forth two claims:  that the art and literature of Bronzeville balanced the aims of social realism with the experimental forms of literary modernism; and that the Chicago Black Renaissance was a movement with its own distinctive energy even as it was informed by a set of aesthetic concerns characteristic to Chicago more broadly.  &#x0D; &#x0D; Writers and artists discussed in the paper include:  Nelson Algren, Arna Bontemps, Gwendolyn Brooks, Horace Cayton, Jack Conroy, Eldzier Cortor, Ralph Ellison, Vivian Harsh, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Wayne Miller, Inez Stark, Gertrude Stein, Era Bell Thompson, Margaret Walker, Richard Wright.  &#x0D; ",Liesl Olson,,4/23/15,,,,,"White City, Black Metropolis"

18149,RZ-255605-17,"My paper draws attention to the understudied local culture of genealogical documentation practiced among the Ismaili pirs and khalifas of Badakhshan. My intention is not to mine the documents as sources for the historical appearance of Nizari Ismailism in Badakhshan, about which we still have limited knowledge, nor to assert the validity or prove the deficiencies of ‘ilm al-nasab in Badakhshan. Rather, using nasab-namahs from Zebak and Ishkashim in Afghanistan, together with interviews and informal genealogical writings preserved as copies by khalifas and their descendants in the 20-21st century, it is to explore the nasab-namah/shajarah genre as a system of knowledge, a source of confessional identity and authority, and a textual tradition that reflects socio-religious connectivity across the writing cultures of the Pamir and Hindukush in regions often considered to be geographically-bounded zones of cultural hegemony. This study is a small part of a larger collaborative project on the genealogical history of Ismailism in the eastern Islamic world, the first stage of which is the completion of an open access digital repository of 65 documents from Badakhshan in Tajikistan and Afghanistan in the Princeton University Library Digital Repository (Digital PUL). This collection is based on an archive of photographs of privately-owned genealogies compiled by me during field research conducted in Tajik and Afghan Badakhshan between 2004-2019. The second stage of the project, a co-authored book manuscript on the collection, is currently in progress, for which I seek to further extend the study of Ismaili genealogical documentation to Chitral, Gilgit and Hunza in the Hindukush.",Jo-Ann Gross,,09/08/2020,,"Note: This conference, which was to take place at the 4th International Hindush Cultural Conference in Chitral, Pakistan, was cancelled due to Covid-19.

18150,RZ-255605-17,"Outside the Sufi silsilah tradition, genealogical cultures of documentation in the Persianate world have not yet been subject to serious critical analysis as have those in the Arab world. My research seeks to bring attention to one such Persianate tradition – that of the nasab-namah/shajarah-namah tradition among the Isma?ilis of Shughnan, Badakhshan. This documentary genre was particularly well developed in 19th century Badakhshan in present-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan, although extant genealogies date back as early as the 16th century. Among the categories of genealogical histories are those of Ismaili foundational figures (lineages of pirs, shahs, khalifas and qadis). This paper will focus on the genealogical tradition of Sayyid Mu?ammad I?fahani (known as Shah Kashan), who in written and oral tradition is represented as one of four missionary figures that traveled from Khurasan to Badakhshan in the 16th century. In contrast to Shah Malang, from whom the Isma?ili pirs of Shughnan Badakhshan trace their descent, and Shah Khamush, from whom the shahs of Shughnan trace their descent, the textual genealogical tradition associated with Shah Kashan traces the sayyid descent of the qazis and khalifas of Shughnan Badakhshan through him to the imams and the Prophet Muhammad. Using five documents dating from the 16th to the 20th century, my paper will: 1) explore the elements of formulaic language, shared terminology, and physical features of the documents and what they tell us about the intentions and the mode of textualization prevalent in the region of Shughnan; 2) analyze the genealogies from the points of view of Ismaili lineage construction and historical context.",Jo-Ann Gross,"Association for the Study of Persianate Societies Biennial Conference in New Delhi, India",03/12/2020,http://N/A,N/A  **Note that this conferences was cancelled due to Covid-19.,,,"""The Genealogical Tradition of Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani (Shah Kashan) in Shughnan, Badakhshan"""

At first the two ideas of this paper's title can seem contradictory, but as three separate words they come together. What is the valency between the hypothesised solidity of an archaeological place and the stream of events that go into making it, transforming it, and erasing it? The ephemeral nature of the archaeological sites created by mobile communities is often the first thing that is said of them and after that comes a long chain of strictures limiting what interpretations are possible. Here I propose a more positive outlook. Using case studies from the Eurasian steppe this paper will search for seemingly ephemeral places and find them as assemblages of many materials. Of primary interest to this discussion will be more mobile subjects ranging from sheep to metals and less mobile ones like stone or drainages. The subject here is not site location models, but an exploration of how places are crafted by the knowledge and action of many actors both ancient and modern.","Wright, J.","84th Society of American Archaeology Meetings, Albuquerque, NM",01/04/2019,https://core.tdar.org/document/450995/place-making-and-ephemerality,,,,"Place, Making and Ephemerality"
18221,AKA-265769-19,"The need to provide science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learners, particularly engineers, with an understanding of humanities is becoming increasingly apparent. Continued globalization through technologies means that what engineers create has an impact on how we communicate within/across societies. Humanities and STEM education are currently siloed, limiting the connection between topics and fields. However, links between the humanities and STEM can deepen students' educational experiences. Exploring the links between STEM and humanities, the Texas Tech University Honors College has developed an interdisciplinary curriculum incorporating the arts and humanities and STEM. Unlike other iterations of this technique, namely STEAM, where arts are included to help promote more creative, innovative problem-solving, this approach uses the humanities as the foundation for STEM learning. We coin this approach Humanities-Driven STEM (HDSTEM). HDSTEM education goes beyond creative thinking and problem-solving, providing soft skills through application of the humanities. Our paper focuses on the development of empathy, one soft skill. Specifically, discourse analysis was used to examine course assignments that ask students to reverse engineer technical dilemmas from World War II. In some instances, students were asked simply to reverse engineer; in others, they were asked to consider broader, contextual, humanitarian concerns during WWII. Results show development in empathetic language, such as emotionally evocative terms, attention to societal aspirations, and human-centric focus over more abstract problem-solution oriented thinking. We believe this illustrates a definite link between empathy development and technical problem-solving.","Joshua Cruz, Stephanie Kuzmack",2020 Gulf Southwest Section ASEE Conference,04/23/2020,https://peer.asee.org/using-humanities-as-context-for-stem-empathy-development-a-discourse-analysis,,,,Using Humanities as Context for STEM Empathy Development: A Discourse

18235,RZ-255645-17,"For most of the 17th century, the middle Rappahannock River valley (Virginia) served as a refuge for Native communities displaced from neighboring river drainages by an aggressive and expanding English settlement. A limited documentary record suggests that these relocated communities interacted in ways that reshaped Native tribal identities in the face of this settler colonialism. In 1608, as many as eight polities made their home in the lower Rappahannock valley. By the end of the century, documents refer to only two: the Nanzatico and the Rappahannock. But what does the archaeological evidence suggest about these interactions and these reconstituting communities and identities?

18366,FA-251630-17,"In traditional Tunisian healing practices, one of the most common diagnoses is affliction by water spirits (ba?riyya). A wide variety of ritual healing musics feature songs dedicated to these water spirits, as well as the saints, such as Sidi Bu Sa‘id el-Baji, who are believed to control them. The praise song (nuba) for Sidi Bu Sa‘id called ra'is el-ab?ar (captain of the seas) is found in numerous healing and devotional musics, providing a shared reference for musics associated with a diversity of communities, including healing traditions of women (such as the mannubiyya), the Jewish community (rebaybiyya), and even drinking parties of laborers (mizwid).

Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, those of women, Jews, blacks, and hard- drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical ""journey"" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community.

18448,HAA-263850-19,"Today's digital libraries consist of much more than simple 2D images of manuscript pages or paintings. Advanced imaging techniques – 3D model-ing, spectral photography, and volumetric x-ray, for example – can be ap-plied to all types of cultural objects and can be combined to create complex digital representations comprising many disparate parts. In addition, emer-gent technologies like virtual unwrapping and artificial intelligence (AI) make it possible to create ""born digital"" versions of unseen features, such as text and brush strokes, that are ""hidden"" by damage and therefore lack veri-fiable analog counterparts. Thus, the need for transparent metadata that de-scribes and depicts the set of algorithmic steps and file combinations used to create such complicated digital representations is crucial. At EduceLab, we create various types of complex digital objects, from virtually un-wrapped manuscripts that rely on machine learning tools to create born-digital versions of unseen text, to 3D models that consist of 2D photos, multi- and hyperspectral images, drawings, and 3D meshes. In exploring ways to document the digital provenance chain for these complicated digital representations and then support the dissemination of the metadata in a clear, concise, and organized way, we settled on the use of the Metadata En-coding Transmission Standard (METS). This paper outlines our design to exploit the flexibility and comprehensiveness of METS, particularly its behaviorSec, to meet emerging digital provenance metadata needs.","Christy Chapman, C. S.

18450,HAA-263850-19,"This paper presents the general use of deep learning for texturing within the virtual unwrapping model. Virtual unwrapping is a software pipeline for the noninvasive recovery of texts inside damaged manuscripts or scrolls via the analysis of tomography and consists of three stages. Segmentation isolates pages or layers as surface meshes, texturing paints these surfaces based on the local neighborhood in the tomography, and flattening produces legible images from the folded, rolled or warped meshes. The pipeline allows for the recovery and restoration of a variety of otherwise lost or hidden heritage objects. This work further expands the generalization of the texturing stage from that of Parker et al. (2019) which trains a neural network to act as the texturing component. Neural networks can be trained to detect not only carbon inks, but any desired signal in tomography data. Additionally, they can output not only color images, but any modality or form desired by the scholar. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) A conceptualization of texture mapping as a general function, perhaps learned, mapping tomography to any modality is established. 2) Several technical improvements to the previous neural network approach are discussed. 3) This framework is applied to new manuscript scan data, yielding state-of-the-art results.","Stephen Parsons, Kristina Gessel, C.

This survey is the first to document systematically the Punic period in this countryside, and thus contributes to prior work at Motya and Marsala (Lilybaeum) in the Punic period. We present our methodology, data, and preliminary analysis of Punic materials and sites found in the survey zone. Drawing on this new data and the results of an earlier survey north of Marsala, this paper considers the local impact of Carthage, given its proximity across the Sicilian Channel. We interrogate the degree to which Carthage itself was transformative to rural residents in our zone, compared to its colonies on the Sicilian coast.

Using the platform Scalar, the interactive, user-friendly site is designed to be rich in multimedia (images, audios, and video), multimodal (multiple ways of experiencing and navigating the material), collaborative and responsive to interests of the saluang community. It does so by documenting the repertoire—the songs number in the hundreds—and mapping the sonic manifestations of place through tagging song titles, landmarks referenced in song texts, performers, and performances with geospatial metadata. I argue that this project helps reimagine the ways ethnomusicologists share research by moving beyond texts and closer to local sonic, visual, and spatial epistemologies and the sensorial worlds of performance.

18520,FT-270454-20,"Encyclopedic texts and reference works played a central role in managing and circulating textual information in the wake of the sixteenth-century publishing boom in China. Innovations in finding devices within such genres have often been associated with the rise of ""consultation reading,"" which allowed a reader to access the material contained within efficiently and without having to wade through excessive textual material. This paper will suggest that ""consultation reading"" was only one of multiple strategies employed by late imperial Chinese readers in their use of encyclopedic texts. I focus here on Fang Yizhi's (1611–1671) Comprehensive Elegances (Tongya), a major encyclopedic text of the seventeenth century. The organizational structure of the text would have allowed for consultation of specific entries, but instructions for use in the paratextual material and embedded within the entries themselves indicate that the text may also have been designed to be read sequentially, almost as one would read a novel or treatise. This sequential mode of reading is evident in the instructions for use in numerous other contemporary ""reference works,"" such as dictionaries.

18571,HB-262749-19,"The pioneering and cosmopolitan Chinese-American screen, stage and television performer Anna May Wong paid her one and only China visit in 1936, in the aftermath of her race-based exclusion from MGM's mega-production The Good Earth, and on the brink of the Second Sino-Japanese War. This trip was filmed by the photojournalist ""Newsreel"" Wong and by Wong herself. Two decades later, at the height of the Red Scare, Wong's quasi-travelogue footage was reedited into an ABC television episode, ""Native Land"" (of the Bold Journey series), which was narrated by the aging Wong and broadcast in April 1957 to the McCarthy-era American audience.  The travelogue footage doubling as a time capsule crystalized the meeting, clashing and negotiation of different times, geopolitics and differently situated audiences, all of which were centered on layers of mediation—of the young cosmopolitan Wong mediating herself to her Chinese public (including nationalist detractors who deemed her Hollywood films defaming to China) on footage originally intended to be shown to the mid-1930s American movie audience, and of the aging Wong mediating her younger self's experience in the bygone pre-WWII China to the 1950s American television audience.  My paper unpacks these layers of mediation to probe Wong's agency that was fashioned through concatenated media making (from film to television) in articulation with her negotiation with different modes of nationalism in the semi-colonial China and in the Cold War America.",Yiman Wang,Association for Asian Studies annual conference,03/22/2021,,,,,When Cosmopolitanism Meets Nationalism: “China’s Daughter” Anna May Wong and Her China Trip Films
18572,HB-262749-19,"Anna May Wong, the most well-known Chinese-American performer active in the first half of the 20th-c., has been commonly seen as the screen-stage originator of Orientalist feminine stereotypes of Lotus Blossom and Dragon Lady—both ending up dead, hence her sarcastic summary of her fictional persona as the woman who had died a thousand times.   This preponderant victim discourse, however, has obliterated an intriguing strand in her performance career—as a comedienne in some 1920s shorts produced by Hal Roach. This paper unearths Wong's performance endeavors as a comedienne by piecing together and contextualizing archival materials ranging from her Hal Roach contracts to fanzine publicities. My goal is two-pronged—enhancing our understanding of Wong's oeuvre and performance legacy, and probing the ways in which early comedy shorts intertwined with the race-gender discourses especially as they pertained to the so-called inscrutable ""Oriental"" face and femininity. I argue that Wong's comedies, while not as abundant as her pathos-laden dramatic films, offers a crucial site for exploring a dimension of her performative agency—one that has escaped critical attention and yet powerfully challenges the received understanding of Asian American racial melancholia.   Methodologically, I ponder questions of how we recover obscured film histories, what to recover, and how to interpret or contextualize such histories so as to illuminate marginalized spaces and lacunae. Grappling with these questions necessitates engagement with the scarcity and incompleteness of empirical evidence. Thus, studying Wong's sparsely documented comedic performance as part of the supporting cast for Hal Roach's 1920s shorts holds broader ramifications for finetuning our methodology of doing early film historiography.",Yiman Wang,,3/18/2021,,,,,“Life is too serious to be taken seriously” &#x0B;Anna May Wong’s &#x0B;Comic “Racial Melancholia”
18573,FEL-262628-19,"Medieval people didn't hesitate to go to court to defend their honor; they took every opportunity to protect themselves from slander and insults. Historians, building on the work of anthropologists of the Mediterranean, have long been attentive to the gendered difference in how medieval people both insulted each other and defended themselves in court. Women were much more likely to suffer slurs based on their perceived lack of sexual honor- they were called ""sluts,"" or ""whores"" and defended themselves vigorously against those attacks in courts. But what happened when the women defending themselves against the charge of being a whore were in fact municipal prostitutes?     Drawing on the one extant set of criminal court records from the fourteenth century and additional records of fines paid for those guilty of slander and insult, this paper will ask why prostitutes brought the business of the brothel into the purview of the criminal court. What advantages accrued to women considered without sexual honor when they swore to tell the truth in a court of law? What manipulations occurred to restrain bodies marked by assumptions of their unrestrained sexuality within the system of the law?  How did the identity of prostitute conflict with that of witness? What motivated the women to contain the violence of the brothel within a legal system that categorized them as outside of the bounds of legal protection?

In response to a generalized lack of attention to Africa in narratives of early modern history, Africanists have emphasized the parallel and interconnected nature of processes unfolding in continental Africa with those elsewhere, while at the same time pointing out distinctive qualities that modify or qualify larger Atlantic or global trends.  Though indispensable for historians, African oral and European written sources for the West African Sahel were created for distinct purposes, organized around divergent premises and centered different audiences. Limits imposed by available sources and certain conceptual frameworks have continued to pose significant challenges— especially for incorporating the historical experiences of non-elites, and of relations across gender, ethnicity and other forms of socially constructed difference. How should historians of western Africa approach these sources to illuminate the complexity and contingency of earlier contexts for a polity heavily reliant on mercenary warfare in the larger economy of slaving while also asserting itself within a religiously and culturally heterogeneous region? This paper will argue that comparative close readings, and contextualization of traditional oral narratives, archival documents and material sources can produce historical insight submerged within these sources about the beliefs, attitudes and assumptions about the people of Kaarta and their dynamic interactions with a wider world.",Jody Benjamin,"Early History of Africa Symposium: New Narratives for a History of Connections and Brokers, UCLA,",01/30/2020,,,,,"Memory in Fragments, Layers and Sound: Tracing the History of Bamana Kaarta in the Eighteenth Century"

4100,RA-50078-09,"The former Ottoman world is home to many communities of Muslim religious minorities that have been variously deemed heterodox deviants from the acknowledged schools of Islamic law. Narratives about them have focused on a certain impurity or syncretism in their religious practices. One such group is the Kizilbash/Alevi community of Anatolia. From the perspective of Ottoman rulers and statesmen, Kizilbash groups were often seen as politically dangerous heretics to be stamped out, or at the very least reformed. With the rise of ethnic Turkish nationalism, another offshoot of this narrative emerged, which posited Alevis as stewards of the pre-Islamic spirituality of Turks from Central Asia. These disparate narratives shared a focus, not on who the Alevis were, but rather why they were not proper Muslims.",Ayfer Karakaya-Stump,Beyond the Sunni-Shiite Conflict:  The Ottomans and the Safavids in the Early Modern Era,10/24/2014,http://www.indiana.edu/~iaunrc/newsevents/upcoming events/beyond-sunni-shiite-conflict-ottomans-and-safavids-early-modern-era,Conference webpage,,,"Defining the Polity by its Boundaries: The Anti-Kizilbash Campaigns as a Catalyst of Ottoman Confessionalization, 16th and 17th Centuries"

Recently, Ottoman historians have intensified their efforts to better understand the socioeconomic dynamics and fiscal-administrative structures of this period. Once considered to be an era of general decline and degeneration, now the prevalent tendency in the field is to characterize these two centuries as an era of major institutional transformation and adjustment to new circumstances. These novel attempts of interpretation are based on impressive archival research and nuanced considerations of the information that this effort has generated in social, political and economic history. However, the progress achieved in these areas has yet to be attained in legal history-writing. Broadly speaking Ottomanists have yet to provide a comprehensive depiction of the ways in which Ottoman law, legal institutions, and practices might have changed between 1600 and 1800.

Was it her extraordinarily monstrous appearance? Probably not. Tannakin Skinker was a woman with the face of a pig, but a broadside depicting two monstrous pigs, one with hands instead of front hooves had been chronicled by Sir John Hayward in 1562. And while pigs have particular biological similarities with humans (early dissectors such as Vesalius often used them as substitutes for humans due to the similarity of their internal organs), the particular conjunction of details that make Skinker compelling are those that make her the perfect emblem for monster-culture of the seventeenth century. Thus, Tannakin Skinker becomes a positive center for previously marginal figures. Her story both has elements of the old flag of monstrosity in its didactic origin while also heralding a new kind of open signification in its secular, comic, literary and economic elements.",Tassie Gniady,Research Slam,5/9/2011,http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/research/colloquia/researchslam/abstracts.html#Tassie Gniady,,,,"Tannakin Skinker: A Case Study of the Hog-faced Woman,"

4207,PW-50005-08,"Barnabe Googe's Eglogs, Epytaphes and Sonettes (1563) is a notable work in literary history for being the first single-author collection of short poetry by a living poet. It has also been notable for its typographic oddities, particularly its practice of splitting pentameter lines in two. Thus, though ""sonnet"" is in the title, none of the poems seem to fit the formal requirements of that genre. However, as was noted long ago by Hoyt Hudson, at least two of the poems are in fact sonnets—and Shakespearean ones at that. They had gone unrecognized because the iambic pentameter lines were split into alternating lines of two and three feet, making twenty-eight line poems instead of the sonnet-standard fourteen. Those scholars who discuss these line breaks have tended to explain it as a simple typographic matter: there was not enough space on the page for the pentameter lines, or Googe simply carried over the practice of splitting fourteeners into lines of four and three feet to his pentameter lines. There is another agent to consider, however, and another tradition of poetry that bears on this typographical oddity: the printers Ralph Newberry and Thomas Colwell and the broadside ballad. Both printers had produced broadside ballads—Thomas Colwell quite regularly—and broadside ballads tended to avoid lines longer than quatrameter. In fact, breaking fourteeners into lines of four and three feet result in one of the most common ballad measures. This paper explores the connections between Googe's Eglogs and the broadside ballad and argues that rather than making a fairly arbitrary typographical choice in breaking the pentameter lines, Newberry and Colwell may have been considering potential readers. Shortening those lines would make the slender collection of poetry appeal to a wider range of readers, and thus increase their chances turning a profit.",Eric Nebeker,"Making Books, Shaping Readers Conference",4/2/2008,http://www.ucc.ie/en/mbsr/confereces/conference2008/,,,,Barnabe Googe and the Ballad Market

4271,AQ-50756-12,"In the spring semester of 2012, I received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to design and teach a course devoted to this question: ‘What is the value of a liberal arts education?' My goal in this paper is to talk about this experience in three different phases: I) discussing the grant with faculty and staff at my institution; II) teaching the class; and III) thinking about the meaning of the liberal arts in the context of higher education today. The thesis that I hope to advance in doing so is that faculty need to justify a liberal arts education based on its intrinsic value and not on its practical value. It is common today to tout the skills that students develop from studying the liberal arts. They learn skills in critical thinking, reading, writing, and speaking, and these skills are necessary in any profession. But many courses outside the liberal arts and humanities teach students skills. It thus becomes necessary, in my judgment, to find the intrinsic value of a liberal arts education. My goal in this paper is to make such a case.",Scott M.

4273,RA-50059-07,"This paper will explore ephemera in British America: its use at the time and its standing now in holdings and collections. Blank forms (single-sheet printing with spaces for handwriting, such as legal forms, indentures, lottery tickets, and so forth) were the bread and butter of colonial printers. Beyond this business interest, how were they valued then and now? Blanks were made to be used: marked up, folded, docketed, torn. This intentional destruction gives pause to the cultural historian interested in questions of value. Yet their role in contracting individuals to the agreed-upon matters involved in the blank form suggests a haunting power in their moment. In book history circles, job printing and blanks have undergone a revitalization of sorts in current scholarship. How might this revitalization challenge literary scholars or how might we reorient questions of value in the worlds of both literary study and textual studies?

Three cases are introduced in this study to demonstrate the implementation of this approach. Case one (funded by NEH): Hadoop is used for crawling the web for map services. It enables us to farm out work to many processors in parallel, making search against 5 billion web pages relatively manageable.  Case two: Hadoop is used to enable researchers to query, analyze, and subset large spatio-temporal datasets containing billions of records. This is demonstrated on global geo-tweets collected over one year. Case three: Hadoop is used to divide up and process calculations of network and straight line distances between thousands of points in New York City over a seven year period.  The total number of distance calculations required for this project is 3.5 billion.

By ""addressing"" we mean being able to refer to, or cite, a passage of music in order to make a statement about it. This could be considered a virtual equivalent of ""circling"" some music notation on a printed score. Michael Witmore (2010) has argued that text is a ""massively addressable object""; that is, given certain abstractions and conventions, it is possible to identify areas of a text such as characters, words, as well as chapters or proper names. Compared to text, music notation is more complicated to represent digitally. Human-computer interaction has since its early days been built around the concept of character and line, which makes dealing with ""plain"" text a fairly straightforward matter for many basic operations; counting the number of characters in a given plain text document is trivial in any digital environment. Music notation, however, requires substantial computational modeling even for the simplest musical text before any further operation is possible. There are, indeed, many ways of representing a single note; some aspects are common to all representation systems, such as information about pitch and duration, but some systems will prioritize certain aspects over others.&#x0D; &#x0D; This poster will show the technical specification created by the EMA project. The specification aims at defining a scheme for addressing a selection of music notation regardless of its representation.

Counting snippets of verse that appeared in death notices, advertisements, and articles makes the presence of poetry in historic newspapers even more pervasive. Feminist scholars and others performing recovery work routinely resurrect authors and works from newspaper pages, but until recently this rich trove of newspaper verse as a corpus of its own has been outside the scope of literary study and a footnote in histories of American newspapers. In the last decade, however, scholars have made significant inroads in studying the importance of newspaper verse as a form and the public role of poetry in American culture. Underpinning this scholarship is a growing recognition that the evaluation and history of American poetry should not be based on less than one percent of the poetic record. In addition, this new scholarship values and explores the role of poetry in the daily lives of people, including making sense of what it means to be human and in processing national, social, and individual experiences. To the extent that these new histories depend on traditional methods of archival discovery and analysis, however, they will remain anecdotal— individual narratives extrapolated from a miniscule subset of the whole, with limited means of situating the anecdote as either representative or idiosyncratic.

In this paper, I will examine local, regional, and trans-Atlantic trade networks within the Rappahannock River Valley through the analysis of locally-made and imported clay tobacco pipes recently excavated. Additionally, these pipe assemblages from the Rappahannock sites will be compared to networks revealed through previous studies of the James and Potomac River Valleys.

18717,RZ-255645-17,"I hope to speak to you on the importance of traditional stories and oral histories. These stories have laid the foundation for documentary and archaeological research by Dr. Ed Ragan and now St. Mary's College, with all three merging together and validating the importance of oral histories. Early on in my work in the Tribe, however, we would tell scholars our stories, but they often dismissed them. After many years of experiencing this rejection of what we knew to be true, we stopped telling our stories to outsiders. But keeping this information closed to the outside world and not speaking about it also caused harm, as we began to question what we had been taught from the elders. Yet every story I have relayed from my elders to Dr. Ed Ragan and St. Mary's has been validated. Please don't discount traditional stories and oral histories because it does much more than just keep truth from being written; it destroys truth in the minds of tribal people and removes the confidence we are taught to have in the knowledge of our elders.",Chief G.

Since then, the ballet has been performed across the US as well as in Italy, Slovenia, and Israel; it has won numerous awards, including one from the Anti-Defamation league; and is the subject of three documentaries.

18726,FA-233404-16,"Reframing Japonisme: Women and the Asian Art Market in Nineteenth-Century France  Elizabeth Emery, PhD, Professor of French at Montclair State University, will speak about her new book, Reframing Japonisme: Women and the Asian Art Market in Nineteenth-Century France, 1853–1914 (Bloomsbury Visual Arts, 2020). This Zoom webinar will be moderated by Rachel Saunders, PhD, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Curator of Asian Art at Harvard Art Museums, and recently elected member of the JASA Board of Directors.  Although 19th- and early 20th-century women collectors actively bequeathed Japanese works to major museums like the Louvre, the Musée Guimet, the Musée Cernuschi and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Japonisme has long been considered the province of a small group of elite men. Dr. Emery's book tells the forgotten stories of French women travelers, salon hostesses, writers, actresses and collectors who engaged with Japanese art alongside their better-known male contemporaries.  In her talk for JASA, Dr. Emery will bring attention to a few of the figures discussed in the book, using Japanese works they once knew to tell their stories. Clémence d'Ennery (1823–1898), the founder of the Musée d'Ennery in Paris, which houses one of the largest collections of netsuke on permanent display, is a central figure. She began collecting Japanese and Chinese mythological creatures in the 1840s, built and decorated a house for them in the 1870s, and bequeathed the Paris-based ""Musée d'Ennery"" to the state as a free public museum in 1893. A friend of the Goncourt brothers and a fifty-year patron of Parisian dealers of Asian art, d'Ennery's struggles to gain recognition as a collector and curator serve as a lens through which to examine the collecting and display practices of other women of her day.

Each student encodes an individual document according to the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative, but the teams make collective decisions about how to handle regularization, annotation, and representation of document structures and features. Student teams also decide how to display their documents online and author a group editorial declaration. This model allows students to contextualize their individual documents and encourages them to become invested in the editorial process, as they must reach consensus about many potential approaches to modeling and publishing their texts.

Such is the case of the Library of the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus, which lacked a program dedicated to the care of collections and disaster management before the event. Although they suffered the impact of the hurricanes, thanks to a rapid response, they managed to mitigate the damage quickly and secure emergency funds to train personnel and stabilize the impacted collections. In addition, this experience gave way to recognizing a new post-Maria scenario, and a new project arises in the institution in order to improve the capacity for prevention, mitigation, preparation, response and recovery.

18970,RA-254182-17,"In the late seventeenth century, a vibrant trade of coins and medallions was taking place across Europe. Cast in an assortment of metals and alloys, these medals depicted events of national significance such as the signing of a peace treaty or the marriage of a sovereign. These coins circulated throughout Europe where they were collected, traded, and sometimes satirized by rival nations. In France, medals were issued to amplify the glory of the King Louis XIV and his reign. Yet in addition to battles and monuments, coins were also cast to commemorate the triumphs of science. In particular, the activities and discoveries of the young Académie royale des sciences in Paris – from their discovery of new moons to the construction of the observatory – became immortalized in numerous medals. The materiality of the coins, in particular the value and durability of the metal, meant they had the ability to travel to a greater degree than other more delicate or ephemeral objects of the Academy. These medals had multiple functions as they circulated both within the walls of the Academy, and in   philosophical and aristocratic circles abroad. The visual allegories and events depicted on the coins were also copied into different formats including printed books and other medals. This paper will explore the coins and medals created on behalf of the French Scientific Academy – what they depicted, how they were used, and why scientific activity became memorialized in metal.

From its foundation in 1666 under King Louis XIV, the Academy's visual products – including paintings, drawings, prints, and coins – repeatedly depicted numerous scientific instruments. Sometimes the instrument portrayed was a specific apparatus developed and used by the Academy such as Christiaan Huygens's pendulum clock; in other instances, a generalized flask or scope stood in for a category of device. Yet, these instruments often had much larger meanings within the work of art, and these meanings varied depending on the work's intended audience.   This paper will explore the instruments depicted in the visual culture of the French Royal Academy of Sciences, and how these instruments contributed to an iconography of natural philosophy developing at the time. In particular, it will look at how this iconography became part of the visual strategy deployed by young Academy during the late seventeenth century. This paper will seek to answer questions including why instruments were given precious visual real estate in the small space of a print or coin?

18992,FT-278673-21,"Given the Electoral College remains prone to problematic election results, it is surprising the conventional view is the ratification debates produced few criticisms of it. Alexander Hamilton and James Wilson claimed few objected (Hamilton 2001; Merill 1978, 565-566). Scholars reinforce the view (Main 1961; Ellis 1999; Milkis and Nelson 2020).  I used a content analysis of ratification records for eight of the original thirteen colonies to show this was not the case. Criticisms included that the Electoral College is too complex, leaves the president too distant from the people, can produce an elective monarchy or despotism, and is prone to domestic and foreign intrigue (Rogers 2010). Now all 13 colonies are available through The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution (DHRC), so the content analysis can be completed. New in this work is an explanation of how the criticisms of the Electoral College exemplify two of the three strands of Anti-Federalist thought (power Anti-Federalism and Democratic Anti-Federalism) Faber identifies (2019). As for audience, the manuscript will be of interest to colonial era and presidential scholars in history and political science. Both will find a comprehensive documentation of founding criticisms of the Electoral College. Beyond that, a more general audience interested in reforming and/or eliminating the Electoral College will learn some criticisms of the institution today were raised during ratification.","Alexandria Cisco, Michael T.

And how did the transmission of knowledge interplay with long-distance trade routes, flows of commodities, capital, and other forms of economic and diplomatic exchange?  This panel puts into conversation a set of comparative but concrete case studies of the transmission of knowledge that spans the maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the South China Seas in the late middle ages. It defines knowledge and the mode of its circulation very broadly, as participants explore how secular, religious, and cultural knowledge was transmitted from a variety of methodological tools: archeology of shipwrecks, textual studies of medical literature, the history of painting, and the diplomatic history of Venetian-Ottoman relations. In doing so, this panel should attract a wide audience of pre-modern historians working across a number of regions and scholarly approaches.  One through-line that can be found in each of the panelists' presentations—which will be an informal discussion of works-in-progress—is the role played by Islamic historical actors and institutions in shuttling knowledge around the globe. Another commonality shared across these studies is that the finding that the transmission of objects—gifts, commodities, books, and portraits—also required the transmission of knowledge and expertise on the meanings and functions of those objects in the new regions and cultures to which they were transported.

This study investigates a sample of 45 of Jar Burials from Phaleron Cemetery in Athens, Greece, in order to understand the health outcomes of non-elite infants and young children during the Archaic Period (ca. 700-480 BCE). Our goals include determining whether infants at Phaleron survived beyond the first few weeks after birth and whether they survived long enough to elicit a bony response to physiological stress. To address these questions, age-at-death was estimated using standard methods based on dental and skeletal development. Pathological bony changes in the cranium and postcranium were also recorded.  Although most infants survived birth and lived beyond the first few weeks after birth, approximately 20% died within two weeks of birth and 67% after two weeks, but before the age of 2. For the 36 individuals for whom dental age estimation was possible, the largest number of individuals died between 3 and 9 months of age. Also, 29% of 45 individuals lived with chronic physiological stress suficiently long to elicit a bony response. These results suggest that the Jar Burials represent children who were accepted into their family after birth but were unable to survive early life physiological stressors. Furthermore, the presence of bony responses to physiological stress suggests that, for at least some of these individuals, stressors were chronic, rather than acute.","Rothwell, J.

19027,RZ-255623-17,"Scurvy is caused by inadequate levels of vitamin C in the diet. Thus, evidence for infantile scurvy in past populations provides a unique window into both early childhood and maternal diets. This study aims to identify the presence of metabolic diseases, such as scurvy, among non-elite children in ancient Athens. Macroscopic examination of 45 infant Jar Burials interred in the Archaic Greek cemetery of Phaleron (Athens, Greece; 700-480 BCE) revealed pathological bony changes in the cranium and postcranium of multiple individuals consistent with prolonged nutritional stress. Most of the bony changes observed in this sample were non-specific; however, bony changes observed in burial 5 154, an infant who died between 6 and 13 months of age, were diagnosed as scurvy using the ""Ortner criteria"" of cranial and postcranial lesions. Cranial bony changes were observed bilaterally in the frontal, zygomatic, sphenoid, parietal, temporals, and occipital, bones, as well as the maxillae and mandible. Furthermore, abnormal postcranial changes affected all long bone metaphyses, the scapulae and ilia. The young age-at-death for this individual and additional evidence for delays in long-bone growth suggest that prolonged nutritional stress would have begun while the infant should have been solely breastfeeding, implying that vitamin C deficiency and nutritional stress were experienced not only by this individual, but by their mother or wet nurse as well.","Prevedorou, E.-A., Rothwell, J.

19054,FEL-267727-20,"Molecular biology is the most self-conscious, most memoired, most mythologized science perhaps ever, and it has its Scriptures. For better and/or worse, James Watson's bestselling memoir, The Double Helix (1968), undergirds all our histories of molecular biology. Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology (or PATOOMB), the 1966 festschrift for Max Delbrück, edited by Watson, Gunther Stent, and John Cairns and published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, established another foundational narrative of molecular biology, the idea that the ""phage group,"" led by Max Delbrück, was the social nucleus from which molecular biology sprang. Watson's contribution to the volume, ""Growing up in the phage group"" cemented that narrative and located Cold Spring Harbor as the crucible from which molecular biology sprang. Historians have also noted that Watson's 1965 Molecular Biology of the Gene, the first textbook of molecular biology, was seminal in bounding, setting the parameters of, and establishing a language for the new science. Receiving at most a footnote in most accounts is that, also in 1968, Watson became director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory—in fact within weeks of the release of The Double Helix. Further, in Watson's famous contribution to PATOOMB, ""Growing up in the phage group,"" he refers obliquely to The Double Helix. The archives reveal that, in fact, these events dovetailed, interlaced, co-constructed one another. Moreover, Watson's appointment as director of CSHL was the culmination of at least six years of intensive involvement with Lab politics, in which he brought Cairns to CSHL as director, advised him regularly during his short tenure, and, when things fell apart, worked to find Cairns a graceful and remunerative exit.

Bahraini scholar Ibrahim Abdullah Ghalloom has likewise argued that censorship by government officials has robbed theatre of its ability to challenge existing pieties; theatre is permitted to exist only to ""consolidate the status quo, be it religious, political, or ethical."" These claims are borne out in my interviews with the region's theatre practitioners, who lament the knee-jerk reactions of official censors to any script that even touches upon the topics of religion, sex, or politics. Under such circumstances, Shakespeare—whose plays decidedly do not shy away from presenting those topics—provides a rich source of inspiration, while the cultural cachet that adheres to his works allows theatre-makers a degree of protection from official censorship.

Using Leonardo's Study of Brambles (RL12419) as a point of departure, this paper explores how Leonardo's botanical ""parts"" (""elementi"") reflect rhetorical concerns related to natural fecundity, its processes and threats. Through close, formal readings of idealizing natural ""limbs"" and their graphic antitheses, this paper suggests how Leonardo's botanical and related studies reflect broader concerns with natural history and functions, even as they reveal the complexity of his empirical, rhetorical, artistic, and theoretical preoccupations. Ultimately, Leonardo constructed ""telling,"" rhetorically motivated botanical anatomies that slyly appear as if they are drawn from nature itself.

Within a few years of this entry in Codex Arundel Leonardo drew and painted a number of images in which a grotto or sedimentary rock formations, home to a host of fossils, played a pronounced role.

Why do these images of dismembered body parts so outnumber images of the ""united bodies"" that Leonardo preferred?

This paper probes these musico-theoretical resonances considering Leonardo's annotations on music, some glossing the same folios bearing these images of the body. While Leonardo eschews metaphysical speculation in favor of a more empirical epistemology, such concordance suggests Leonardo's self-positioning within the schematic orthodoxies of musica humana. If music is a weaker sister to art, her embodiment of the cosmos and inspiration of corporeal motion frames Leonardo's project of body neatly within this Neoplatonist lens.

These mechanisms open up ways for thinking about Leonardo's preoccupation with a phenomenological investigation of the water environment — after all, what is scuba gear but a means for experiencing fully one's senses under water? — and by extension, its picturing.

In particular, this research explores how Aristotelian thought allows for both an ideal beauty and an ideal ugliness. Leonardo's drawings from Uffizi #446E to the later Chatsworth examples present a visual compendium of idealized, even hyperbolic, ugliness. The effect of such images, either singularly or collectively, is to subvert his audience's basic assumptions about portraiture. The subversion extends even to Alberti's more general notion of the commemorative purpose of painting.

A summary follows.&#x0D; &#x0D; From 1996-1999, longtime OSF company member, Carl Ritchie (nearly 50 years as an actor, director, playwright and OSF's first year-round publicity director in the 1950s and 1960s), conducted a detailed inventory of OSF's audio collection—nearly 2,000 reel-to-reel and cassette tapes documenting productions back to 1950. Ritchie listened to each recording, identified its contents and created an innovative categorization scheme resulting in a six volume, 900+ page catalog. As a result, the OSF Archives had a well-organized audio collection offering a connection to OSF's past that otherwise would have been lost. However, following the project's completion, the tapes were restricted due to fragility and remained inaccessible for more than a decade.&#x0D; &#x0D; When the OSF Archives began preparing materials for a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Preservation and Access grant in 2012, Ritchie's work formed the foundation of the proposal. His catalog served as a guide, and his urgent calls for action to save many deteriorating tapes remain an ongoing inspiration. The NEH grant is funding the digitization of 2,655 audiovisual items, most from Ritchie's catalog. The majority of these materials will be available to the research community online in 2016 and stand as a testament to one man's dedication and foresight.","Debra Griffith, Gwyn Hervochon",American Society for Theatre Research/Theatre Library Association combined meeting,11/6/2015,,,,,"“Stay Four Days, See Four Plays”; preserving the audiovisual collection of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival "

First, although the chapter is generally read as an autobiographical account of the psychic costs Addams suffered during World War One, I show how it gives a theoretically sophisticated exploration of how war blocked inquiry for an international group of peace advocates on both sides of the war. Second, the chapter's concluding sentence, where Addams declares her ""categorical belief that a man's primary allegiance is to his vision of the truth,"" is generally read in a straightforward way. I show how Addams intended it to be read ironically, as demonstrating how the war had made a travesty of her deepest commitments.",Marilyn Fischer,Second European Pragmatist Conference,09/11/2015,http://epc2.sciencesconf.org,Conference program,,,"When Inquiry is Blocked: Addams's ""Personal Reactions During War"""
4700,RZ-51147-10,"During the recent fieldwork season at Tell Edfu several hundred new seal-impressions have been discovered in connection with a late Middle Kingdom administrative structure. They were found in a secure archaeological context which is the abandonment layer covering the floor of a columned hall that is part of larger building complex closely linked to the mayor of the town.  The pottery from this layer dates to the 13th Dynasty including imported vessels, which have been identified as Levantine Painted Ware, also common for the late Middle Kingdom. &#x0D; Many of the seal-impressions found in this context show the typical late 13th Dynasty motives but a large portion of them display the characteristics of the Tell el-Dab'a workshop and the Canaanite scarabs of the Second Intermediate Period. The most unexpected find among this group were several seal-impressions showing the cartouche of the Hyksos ruler Khayan, who has been dated to the beginning of the 15th Dynasty.  This is the first time that concrete evidence for a Hyksos king south of Gebelein has been found. This unique discovery opens many new questions about the nature of contact between the Hyksos and Upper Egypt prior to the armed conflict with the Theban kings of the 17th Dynasty.

These seemingly independent crises have all reached their tipping point in the beginning of the 21st century and many countries are looking at high-capital technological solutions to resolve these crises.  These technocratic responses will be unable to solve the problems in their entirety.  &#x0D; Physical planning merged with geographic, political, social and economic strategies are necessary to combat the challenges that lie ahead.  Energy required to move from building to building is far greater than the energy requirements to cool and heat individual buildings.

To this end the development of objective criteria to evaluate which settlements should be retrofitted is essential.&#x0D; The planning profession needs to be at the forefront of cost-effective solutions that yield value, provide safety, create community, and offer the populace an alternate lifestyle that is more desirable than the current market place dream of privacy, exclusivity, and segregation.&#x0D; ",Dhiru A.

Archaeologists have combined evidence from macro- and micro-scale approaches to landscape that includes analyses of the social, economic, and environmental factors governing planters' decisions about the siting of quarters as well as the use of space by enslaved residents. Central to this research are the questions of how enslaved people structured non-architectural spaces, what activities they undertook within them, and how domestic landscapes served them as community spaces, centers of economic production, and places of resistance.  At Poplar Forest, archaeologists have been exploring the landscapes of slave quarters dating from the American Revolution to the late antebellum period.

Together, these sources reveal aspects of the layout and function of spaces on plantation peripheries, such as the Wingos Quarter at Poplar Forest, and help to document landscapes that many scholars do not  commonly associate with plantations, such as the tavern-store-plantation complex that developed at Indian Camp in the early 19th-century.",Barbara J.

5009,RZ-51154-10,"Indian Camp, a plantation in the eastern Virginia piedmont, served as an outlying quarter farm for tobacco cultivation from 1730 to the 1790s. Just prior to 1800, an ordinary and retail store were built there and continued in operation into the 1840s. Since 2011, archaeologists working on the property, now known as French's Tavern, have concentrated efforts in a field west of the surviving historic structures. The site contains a complex array of post holes, pits, piers and other features, evidence of a dynamic landscape that took shape in the final quarter of the eighteenth century and was reconfigured throughout the antebellum period. This paper reviews the archaeological evidence uncovered to date and considers the roles of ordinaries and stores as important places of exchange for both free and enslaved piedmont residents, allowing rural people to cross plantation boundaries and participate, to some extent, in wider social and economic networks.","Meagan Dennison, Barbara J.

Central to this research are the questions of how enslaved people structured non-architectural spaces, what activities they undertook within them, and how domestic landscapes served them as community spaces, centers of economic production, and places of resistance.  At Poplar Forest, archaeologists have been exploring the landscapes of slave quarters dating from the American Revolution to the late antebellum period.

Since the 1960s, researchers have considered ""Africanisms,"" assemblage patterning and predictive geographic models to answer the question: what defines a slave quarter archaeologically? The accumulation of an archaeological dataset of over 100 quartering sites in Virginia over the past 40 years has demonstrated that these sites are highly variable across time and space and has underscored the problematic nature of site definition. This paper examines three Virginia quartering sites dating to the Revolutionary War period. The observed similarities and differences between them likely resulted from a combination of historical circumstances, shared processes of racialization, poverty and regional variation in the institution of slavery.

Establishing a system of classification has help clarify local building history.  Petrographic analysis correlates specific building sites with at least three island quarries.  The choice of construction stone was based on physical attributes and engineering properties. Limestones and dolomites with open cavities (vugs) were light weight yet strong and thus well suited for foundations, while basalt, trachyte, and rhyolite were mainly limited to the lowest level of foundations or large-scale polygonal retaining walls. The carbonates show varying degrees of post-installation weathering and degradation, most notably in the increased volume of cavities created by the plucking out of various sized pebbles.

19261,RZ-230579-15,"The central valley of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, accessed via the Eastern Hill's sacred way, has at its ritual focus the Hall of Choral Dancers and to its south, the monumental Hieron. Yet, the enigmatic structure immediately west of the Hieron known as the Altar Court plays an equally important role as the kinesthetic and architectural fulcrum between the central sanctuary and the monuments and terraces of the Western Hill. While architectural proportions and ornamentation link the Altar Court to the Hieron, its colonnaded and inscribed facade emphasizes its westward orientation, as it looks toward the theater, thereby infusing the space between the two edifices with both ritual and theatrical connotations.  Today, as in the past, the sanctuary's central ravine dramatically bisects this interstitial space, the deep channel sharply separating the central valley from the Western Hill throughout the sanctuary and hindering movement between the two areas. Excavation and study of the ravine's ancient remains have clarified the formal qualities of this monumental project, and the high material costs likely associated with its original construction phase and major renovation during the Roman period. The question of how this feature was bridged, and thus controlled movement between different areas of the sanctuary, is especially important in the area between the Altar Court and theater. Rather than a hindrance, the central ravine's mediation of movement played a crucial role in shaping experience and emphasizing key architectonic relationships.","A. Farinholt Ward, J.

19262,RZ-230579-15,"Searching for the head of the Winged Victory in 1891, Charles Champoiseau first exposed the theater that ascends the western slope connecting the central sanctuary to the stoa plateau within the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. Several rows of well-preserved seats, the diazoma, and other features were uncovered by a French-Czech team in 1923, but when Karl Lehmann arrived at the site in 1937, evidence of the theater had largely vanished. Relying on other evidence, Lehmann arrived at a reconstruction that became the basis upon which scholars have understood the theater and its place within the larger sanctuary.  Recent research and excavation, however, has allowed us to clarify our understanding of the monument: georeferencing and correcting inaccuracies in the original French-Czech plan, determining the major design features of the theater, and gaining a better understanding of the complex topographic relationship of the buildings that define this critical zone of the Sanctuary. The koilon may have consisted only of the central five kerkides that survive, for a wedge-shaped design similar to the nearby theater at Thasos, but a fuller design should not be excluded. The newly secured position and dimensions of the orchestra, meanwhile, help to resolve the dual elevation issue in the space between the Altar Court and theater, and provide new evidence for how the Nike monument above the theater was oriented to meaningfully interact with the theater and the areas of the central sanctuary below.  Unfortunately, excavations have not clarified the date of the theater. Reconsideration of the orientation, function, and date of adjacent monuments provides relative evidence to suggest that the creation of a permanent stone theater may belong closer to the middle of the third century B.C.E, rather than the traditional dating at the end of the third or the early second century B.C.E.","B.

Using photogrammetic 3D modeling of fragments on Samothrace and in the Louvre, we demonstrate that the Nike's ram is closely related to Egadi ram 1, relic of the first Carthaginian War, as well as a well-preserved Lartian marble ram, from a similar naval monument erected in Rhodes. Our new reconstructed 3D model of the prow demonstrates both the remarkable engineering required to construct the cantilevered block as well as the visual force of the projecting ram in this iconic monument.  Second, we use photogrammetric modeling to create a complete 3D set of scattered fragments of large-scale plaster lion heads from the Nike precinct. Never systematically studied, these humble fragments offer critical new evidence about the precinct. The remains indicate at least two, possible three lions head, possibly belonging to waterspouts on a sima. If correct, this would provide strong evidence that the Nike stood within a roofed structure. We present evidence for the profile of the block to which the lion heads were originally attached and discuss the unusual scale of the lions' heads for the likely size of the Nike's building.","B. D.

19264,RZ-230579-15,"The Nike of Samothrace is considered one of the most important sculptural creations of the Hellenistic period and has received extensive scholarly attention. Nevertheless, most of the monument's publications focus on its sculptural style/features to extrapolate mainly on the issues of the identity of the dedicator, the sculptor of the statue, as well as the occasion for which it was erected. Dates proposed thus far for the monument range greatly, from the early third century to the first century B.C.E. However, the widely accepted placement of the statue in the period of the so-called Hellenistic baroque seems to narrow its date to about 250–150 B.C.E. Pottery, an important component of almost any archaeological problem, has not been taken into consideration so far. This paper argues that the pottery discovered in association with the Nike monument sheds light on the puzzling issue of its date, supporting or weakening some of the proposed theories.  This paper presents the pottery discovered in 1939 and in the 1950s and 1980s within the Nike precinct and its immediate surrounds. Certain caveats emerge: what kind of pottery should be expected for such a kind of monument? How much of this pottery material originally belonged to the area of the precinct? These concerns, combined with the fact that most pottery derives from disturbed fills, call for caution. Nevertheless, a rather uniform picture emerges: the pottery assemblage is dominated by the locally produced Samothracian conical bowls and small bowls, predominantly of the later variety with a string-cut base. Other shapes found in abundance include cooking ware, jugs, and transport amphorae. Consequently, this presentation argues that the date of the Nike monument in the late third to early second century B.C.E., initially proposed by Karl Lehmann, is not supported by the current analysis of the pottery from the Nike precinct.",A.

19265,RZ-230579-15,"The largest building in the Sanctuary, the stoa has been conspicuous since the first excavations at the site but has never been fully published. This paper presents the results of new research into the stoa's architecture, decoration, and use—helped especially by the identification of the corner geison block in the Louvre. Identifying the position of every block in the building's south wall, for instance, has revealed subtle design features, such as an intentional, uniform slope along the building's length. Was this a utilitarian addition to drain water from the stoa's terrace or an aesthetic refinement? The terra-cotta roof system indicates local craftsmanship but shares stylistic links with Hellenistic palaces, suggesting that the stoa's designers may have had palatial ambitions. Finds from the stoa, especially metal objects including iron, lead, and bronze fragments of construction materials, architectural embellishments, vessel parts, votive offerings, and jewelry, offer rich evidence for the building's ornamentation and the types of objects used within the building, as well as a glimpse of the many ancient visitors to the site. Capacity estimates for the building and adjacent theater reveal that the two structures functioned in tandem and could host crowds on a different scale than the intimate gathering places used for initiation into the Samothracian mysteries. These new avenues of investigation allow us to propose that the stoa was likely a local initiative financed by the Samothracian community. Its departures from the architectural conventions of the Sanctuary's ornate marble dedications shows how a city harnessed local crafts to meet international ambitions.","S. Holzman, A. S. Koch, C.

19266,RZ-230579-15,"The massive terrace built to support the Stoa became a highly desirable location for sculptural dedications in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. The surviving foundations of at least seven monumental statue platforms attest to the accumulation of grand dedications lining the stoa's facade. The remains of some are well preserved although no longer in situ; the appearance of several others above their foundations has long remained enigmatic. This paper presents the results of recent research into the monumental dedications on the stoa terrace. Through new field research, we can now attribute many fragments to particular foundations, enabling a clearer reconstruction of the dedicatory landscape of the stoa terrace. In a particularly exciting discovery, we have identified fragments of an Ionic column from the area that indicate an impressive column monument adjacent to the already known column monument of Philip V. In addition, a newly identified cutting on the Philip V base has furthered our understanding of the dedication's form, and the marble analysis of statue base fragments has revealed a wide range of imported marbles deployed in a variety of combinations on the stoa terrace. After analyzing the reciprocal relationship among sculptural dedications and the stoa, we show how the configuration of monuments determined visitors' access to the stoa in antiquity. We argue that dedicators strategically placed monuments in front of the stoa to create major entrance points and to vie for physical prominence and maximum visibility. Ultimately, we argue, these monuments converted the open terrace into a pathway that simultaneously prescribed entrance to the stoa and propelled visitors toward expansive vistas overlooking the Aegean Sea and central Sanctuary, encouraging visitors to recall their maritime approach to the island and to mentally reenact their recent physical and emotional journey through initiation into the mysteries of the Great Gods.","S.

Unfortunately, most of these imaging systems are very expensive and not intuitive to use.

To address the above issues, we have developed a low-cost multispectral imaging system with accompanying open-source software that librarians, curators, and scholars with limited budgets can use to recover obscured and illegible text in their collections. The developed system is easy to use, can be dismantled and transported with little effort, and produce good quality spectral images as well as accurate true color renderings for digitization if needed. The software was developed with simplicity and functionality in mind. Basic image processing to uncover lost text is easy to implement without special image processing knowledge.

In this talk, I will discuss how the rise of Kun opera (kunqu) in the sixteenth century is another such moment, when the singing voice is explicitly theorized and championed as part of a new art form emphasizing vocal virtuosity and connoisseurship within the entertainment world. To analyze the aesthetic categories and performative context of this musical discourse, I will concentrate on the writings of two key figures: Precepts of the Aria (Qulü), attributed to Wei Liangfu, the shadowy ""forefather"" of the Kun operatic style, and the personal essays of Pan Zhiheng (1556-1622), who earned the moniker ""Venerable Chronicler of Courtesans."" Pan is the most outspoken late Ming proponent for the preeminence of the human voice, for exalting an ideal of the voice (both in the most abstract and concrete ways), as something exceeding the words, something even exceeding the music, something even beyond the fusion of text and music. In the final part I will consider the larger implications of conceptualizing the voice as ""flesh,"" both in terms of late Ming claims for the power of qing (love, desire) and anthropologist Tim Ingold's suggestion that we think of ""the body ensounded"" rather than ""sound as embodied.""",JUDITH ZEITLIN,"Sound and Noise in Asia Symposium, University of Colorado, Boulder",11/05/20,http://https://www.colorado.edu/cas/2021/03/04/successful-sound-and-noise-asia-symposium,,,,‘Instrument of Flesh’: The Operatic Voice in Late Ming Musical Culture

19436,PW-253826-17,"No one knows law's violence like those on its receiving end, yet imprisoned people have typically served merely as objects of socio-legal study. This paper argues for adoption of broad-scale, first-person prison witness as the primary map for a transformative justice seated in prison-born clarifications of what constitutes the human. U.S. prisons are de facto extra-legal spaces, nearly immune to legal rules or accountability. Those who witness penal practice know just how ineffective legal remedies are in penetrating prison walls. They are thus singularly situated to chart extra-legal paths to fully humane conceptions of justice as evidenced by first-person testimony from U.S. prisons and other carceral sites. In their essay on transformative justice, Paul Gready and Simon Robins write, ""A transformative approach will need to be context dependent, driven by the local and particular understandings of rights in any context and consider the diversity of understandings that might exist. It will challenge a purely normative approach with a base of evidence"" (Gready and Robins 2014, 344).  The primary base of evidence for this paper is The American Prison Writing Archive, a digital archive of (to date) 2,776 essays authored by 1,075 currently and formerly incarcerated people writing about their experience inside.

Informed by intersectionality and decolonial theory, as proposed by Latina, Black, and Indigenous feminist scholarship, Rhizomes uses a broad notion of ""art"" in order to reach across humanities disciplines, types of institutions, time periods, and modes of creativity, as well as an inclusive notion of ""Mexican America"" that does not rely on citizenship. Conceived and designed in stages, Rhizomes will eventually assist under-resourced institutions with the digitization of artwork and provide a toolkit for light weight, low-tech online sharing, thereby linking libraries, archives, and museums with relevant materials and enhancing the discovery of Mexican American art. In the first iteration, Rhizomes harvests artworks and related documentation from large, national and midsized regional aggregators, such as the Digital Public Library of America and Calisphere, respectively. However, the first iteration of Rhizomes may not achieve its decolonial and intersectional goals. Although this post-custodial portal avoids the extractive methods of colonial collectors, code requires specificity and precision that limits the application of intersectional and decolonial frameworks. The presentation explores the complex decisions made in the building of Rhizomes that may not resolve the Eurocentricity of the existing aggregators, including the authority of Dublin Core and its erasure of intersectionality.

Some of the factors threatening these collections are the obsolescence of the medium for teaching; the advancing age, and retirement, of the creators; and lack of appropriate archival storage. The SAH,  through the Color Film Emergency Project, recognizes the importance of this part of 20th century intellectual history and documentation, and aims to facilitate its preservation, digitization, and access. With NEH funding, staff at UC Riverside and UC Santa Barbara are collaborating to achieve the following two foundational goals: 1. Identification and evaluation of at-risk 35mm slide collections of SAH members. 2. Development of a consortium of institutional partners to improve preservation goals.","Sonja-Sekely-Rowland, Jackie Spafford",Art Librarians Society of North American Annual Conference,05/12/2021,,,,,Inter-Agency Collaboration: Piloting a Visual Resources Consortium to Meet Society of Architectural Historians Preservation Goals through an NEH Grant-Funded Project

19564,FEL-268440-20,"In 1952, Toy Len Goon was selected as U.S. Mother of the Year.  She was brought to Washington D.C. to be introduced to Congress and meet with Bess Truman and Ambassador Koo of Taiwan.  Having emigrated to the U.S. to join her husband at the age of 29, she raised eight children while running a hand laundry after her husband died.  She was publicly lauded for raising ""good American citizens"" without the aid of a husband and while refusing welfare.  But she was also chosen because she was a Chinese American woman who could exemplify the virtues of mothering and of American upward mobility. As the U.S. endeavored to extend influence in Asia, her D.C. visit had been orchestrated by Maine Rep. Robert Hale, in what the media termed ""a blow in the Cold War for Asia"" (Yeh 2012). While the WW II period marked a distinct shift in the portrayal of Chinese American women and family, the 1950s Cold War period also saw a broader focus on women and mothers as preservers of domesticity and the nuclear family in the U.S., in contrast to their counterparts in the Soviet Union who were suffering under Communist rule. This focus was accompanied by increasing recognition that this domestic life was not always possible or desirable, particularly for women of color. As newspaper coverage of her selection as Mother of the Year illustrated, Toy Len Goon was celebrated as a model mother, but there was disagreement on whether this was because she fulfilled traditional roles of domesticity, or because she was breaking out of that role by running a business to support her family. The fact that her life story could be interpreted in various ways to support specific ideas of family and women's roles was in part because she in fact occupied the roles of both homemaker and business owner. As I discuss in this paper, interviews with her children reveal the double burden she was forced to take on, providing a perspective that complicates celebratory views of her roles in the home.",Andrea Louie,,11/20/20,,,,,"A Model Minority and a Model Mother: U.S. Mother of the Year, Toy Len Goon (1952)”"

19573,FEL-267414-20,"Between 1906 and 1960, colonial French filmmakers represented Africa and Africans in a seemingly endless flood of uninformed and racist travelogues, expedition narratives, and ethnographic films, images that were captured and extracted for consumption in the metropole. Moreover, given the barriers imposed by the cost of equipment and training and, after 1934, the notorious Laval Decree, Africans were prohibited from filming on their own continent. If only colonial images remain, what should we do with them? A model of restitution based on physical objects does not work for moving images, yet, drawing on my research on both colonial European and postcolonial African cinemas, I will argue that it is just as crucial to return them. Giving them back, differently from objects, does not mean giving them up, since the technology exists to produce high-quality digital copies. It does mean, however, foregoing both income from licensing fees and control over how the images are used. Despite the call for ""digital sharing"" of colonial photographs and films in Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy's 2018 report on restitution to French President Emmanuel Macron, no such project is underway with respect to collections either at the public Centre National du cinéma et de l'image animée or the private Gaumont Pathé Archives.Without formal restitution, France prevents Africans from owning moving images of their history, thus retaining control of our filmic understanding of the colonial period and its consequences.",Rachel Gabara,Modern Language Association Convention,1/8/2022,,,,,“Giving Back Colonial Films”

They wanted to preserve their traditional tribal autonomy and loathed any strict central administration. Although they were Muslims, most rejected Sunni understanding of Islam and maintained some of their pre-Islamic religion and practices. Throughout the 16 th&#x0D;  century, the Safavid movement gained the support of many of these Turcoman tribes and grew thanks to their economic and military contribution. Because of this affiliation with the Safavid movement, these Turcoman tribes were called kizilbas (lit. red head) after the headgear designed by the leader of the Safavid order Haydar (d. 1488). &#x0D; In  addition  to  military  fight,  the  Ottoman  government  sustained  an  ideological  campaign  against  the  kizilbas during  the 16th century.  In  this  context,  the  fatwas  and  treatises,  which  were  composed  by  Ottoman  scholar-bureaucrats and concerned the evaluation of the beliefs and practices of the kizilbas from the Sunni religio-legal perspective, played a significant role in the demarcation of ideological lines between two sides.  Scholar-bureaucrats came up with two verdicts about the kizilbas:  unbelief  (kufr/küfür)  and  apostasy  (irtidad).

5191,RA-50078-09,"This paper explores the efforts of the Ottoman central government in Istanbul to regulate the corsairing activities of the perennially disobedient port cities of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli and to define what constituted a legally permissible (halal) raid. From the late 15th century onward, the diplomatic instruments that regulated peaceful relations between the Ottomans and the Venetians, the ahdnames, contained clauses prohibiting piracy and the enslavement of each other's subjects. Similar articles made their way into the ahdnames subsequently concluded with France, England, and the Netherlands. By the 17th century, however, the sultan's nominal subjects in North Africa were regularly violating these provisions, with Tunisian and Algerian corsairs routinely attacking Venetian ships and raiding Venetian shores in contravention of the treaty and over the objections of Ottoman officials in Istanbul.&#x0D; Even as the Atlantic powers concluded treaties directly with the North African port cities beginning in the 1620s, meant to spare them from attack and redirect it towards their rivals, Venice continued to seek redress exclusively from Istanbul.&#x0D; Drawing on an array of Ottoman and Venetian archival and manuscript sources, this paper surveys the damage done to Venetian interests in the Ottoman Mediterranean by piratical attacks in the first half of the 17th century, and it explores the ways in which Ottoman jurists and administrators attempted – through fatwas and decrees rather than by force – to counter the claims of Tunisian and Algerian corsairs that the principles of retaliation, custom and Islamic law gave them the right to attack Venetian targets, irrespective of what the sultan's ahdname promised.",Joshua M.

Paradoxically, however, genocide as such did not occur in the city/province; as the entire power structure in Van swiftly and radically changed hands between rival empires multiple times in a matter of a few months.

More than any other concern, rampant piracy threatened commerce and the peace and sent innumerable diplomats, messengers, dispatches, and funds back and forth across the eastern half of the Mediterranean basin. Anti-piracy articles appeared in every commercial treaty (known as ahdname) the two powers concluded from 1482 onward.

Revitalization of a classical genre, morality books, takes place in this context. More than a hundred books published on morality attests to the fact that morality became one of expanding/transforming fields of knowledge. &#x0D; As the Empire went through a nation-and-state formation process, Ottoman moralists placed an original emphasis on work, making it a central issue not only for the moral development of the individual but also for the advancement of the nation in general, articulating normative dimensions of citizenship.  They fortified their argumentations by referencing Islam's symbolic universe.  They adamantly opposed beliefs and practices that are identified as handicaps for productivity by declaring them un-Islamic and anti-progress. Could this phenomenon of moralized and popularized discourses of productivity be seen as merely a Western content filling the Islamic forms?

It often rehearses an interaction between two or more protagonists and regularly focuses on the interaction between the person(s) represented, and his/her or their surroundings. The same portrait, or portraits of the same sitter, can also find themselves interacting with each other across different media—paint, print sculpture, and more. Furthermore, curators are continually thinking about the ways in which the portraits they display—and the individuals these pictures portray—relate with each other across and around a gallery. This symposium, was jointly organized by the Yale Center for British Art, the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens.",Caroline Fowler,"""Portraiture as Interaction: The Spaces and Interfaces of the British Portrait""; The Huntington Library, San Marino, CA",12/11/2015,"https://enfilade18thc.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/48985-huntlib-insidepanel r1.pdf ","This URL links to the symposium program, which provides a full description of the symposium with roster of presenters and presentation titles.",,,Raphael’s Apostles and Portraiture in the Eighteenth Century

5332,RA-50103-11,"When European optical devices were first introduced into early modern East Asia, these devices affected not only viewing experiences and ideas about vision, but also the production of art. In contrast to the well-established effects on Japanese art, the effects on Chinese art have barely been explored, in part because the science of optics did not develop significantly in China prior to the mid-nineteenth century. Yet from the seventeenth century onward, Qing domestic production and use of optical devices resulted in significant relationships with art at the imperial, elite, and popular levels. The devices and the viewing experiences that they mediated created varying levels of foreign intervention into Chinese art, vision, and visuality. However, the consistent but diverse methods of Sinification of all these elements and the reliance on domestic products rather than imports offers new insights into how Qing art engaged the West without being limited to either the court or the capital. Through an art-historical case study of several different optical devices and their related works of art that are all linked through one particular type of magnifying lens, this presentation examined how the production and consumption of these new objects and images varied by place, format, audience, and social status.",Kristina Kleutghen,"Workshop - ""Visual and Material Perspectives on East Asia"" University of Chicago, IL ",04/15/2016,"http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/vmpea/ ","This URL links to the Workshop program, with presentation abstracts.

These assemblages are associated primarily with enslaved laborers who lived in three Antebellum quartering areas on the plantation. Building on previous research about slaves' acquisition of non-provisioned goods, this poster interrogates one subset of these data, imported ceramics, to assess the distribution of goods across the spatially-divided enslaved community. First, we establish a plantation-wide chronology using correspondence analysis to date deposits from the mansion backyard, outlying field quarters, and the First Hermitage, the earliest settled area of the plantation. We then review how specialized forms and decorated vessels varied across time and space between the three domestic areas, and whether this variation reflects relative investment in market goods.","Elizabeth A.

In this poster, we evaluate these conclusions with data from Andrew Jackson's Hermitage plantation. Recent analysis by DAACS of the collections excavated from slave quarter assemblages indicates five phases of occupation across the Hermitage property. In light of this fine-grained chronology, we explore the influence of Jackson's program of housing standardization and the proximity of domestic contexts to the mansion on enslaved people's access to market goods. Specifically, we examine whether diversity in the decorative techniques and elements on ceramics acquired by enslaved people shifts as a result of these two variables.

9701,RQ-50658-12,"In his nine-volume record of conversations with Whitman in the last years of the poet's life, published as With Walt Whitman in Camden, Horace Traubel and the poet joke about Traubel's collecting—not just the poet's words, but also his letters and manuscripts, even retrieving some of the latter out of the trash in Whitman's house on Mickle Street.  Traubel's volumes have been cited as evidence of Whitman's responses to a range of topics, from politics to poetry.  Lacking from the conversation, however, is a sense of Traubel as collector.  In the course of drafting his meticulous notes, Traubel also created an elaborate indexing system, noting at the top of the letters and manuscripts Whitman gave him the locations of corresponding transcriptions in his notes.  The Whitman Archive is currently engaged in the first comprehensive effort to publish Whitman's early prose manuscripts and his incoming correspondence, bringing several of the manuscripts and letters marked by Traubel to light.  Traubel's notes link individual documents to a rich context of conversations between Whitman and Traubel and Traubel's own efforts to create an archive of documents related to the poet.

Church KMBC Radio Collection. KMBC, a CBS-affiliated station in Kansas City, was established in 1927 by Arthur B. Church, the broadcasting pioneer responsible for several syndicated radio shows including The Texas Rangers, Phenomenon, and Brush Creek Follies. The sound recordings in the collection are a treasure trove of local and national history from the late 1930s through the 1940s, revealing the American experience during wartime through news broadcasts, political speeches, musical entertainment, rural comedies, and radio soap operas. Coupled with the sound recordings were a large number of stampers--metal plates used to press or ""stamp"" grooves onto plastic to produce vinyl records. These manufacturing parts contain a wealth of musical performances by the Texas Rangers, Tex Owens, Bonnie King, Tune Chasers, and Harry Jenks that had been hidden in our collection, and possibly others. We determined that in order to transfer the audio from these metal stampers, a special stylus would need to be acquired. As these particular styli are difficult to manufacture, we found ourselves in a ""waiting game."" With the impending deadline arose a new concern: How do we discover and provide access to content from these obsolete metal plates? In this poster, we demonstrate the multi-faceted process used to leverage existing resources and acquire additional materials in the most cost-effective way in order to preserve and reveal the hidden contents of an obsolete format. We present the issues, outcomes, and unexpected discoveries that led us to successfully identify and provide access to the recordings in the KMBC Radio Collection.","Sandy Rodriguez, Christina Tomlinson","International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres (IAML) Conference, Montreal, QC",07/26/2012,https://hdl.handle.net/10355/48325,Entry in the University of Missouri Institutional Repository--MOspace.,,,Tune Chasin’ the Past: Unlocking the Hidden Contents of a Disc Stamper Collection
9732,PW-50866-11,"Starting in the 1920s through the late 1950s, Kansas City-based broadcasting pioneer Arthur B. Church produced a broad range of syndicated radio programs including Phenomenon, The Brush Creek Follies and the Texas Rangers. The Texas Rangers were a particularly successful franchise, heard on over 100 of the 116 CBS affiliate stations. The eight-man choir played twenty different instruments between them, while garbed in western wear, topped, of course, with classic white hats. Their ability to traverse successfully between hymns, cowboy songs, novelty, and western swing demonstrates their incredible range as musicians both on their own show and on The Brush Creek Follies. Moreover, they displayed their acting skills in Night Time on the Trail and Life on Red Horse Ranch, broadcasts offering ""thrills of the old west"" that mixed drama, romance, comedy, and music. Skilled as they were, their formidable talents remain in relative obscurity. As part of an NEH-funded grant project, the University of Missouri--Kansas City University Libraries is bringing the Texas Rangers and their posse back to light! By providing bibliographic access and digital preservation to a collection of transcription discs, lacquer discs, and negative metal stampers that comprise the KMBC collection, radio aficionados will once again be able to delight in the antics of the Rangers.

The course examines historic controversies and cultural interpretations surrounding the evolving meaning of ‘natural state', paying special attention to the beginnings of the cosmos, life and humanity. Approaches from cosmology, molecular biology, environmental science, anthropology and religion are considered, ending with a discussion of fundamentalism and sustainability as they pertain to defining ""the natural state"" in the twenty-first century.  Sustainability is a difficult word to define, but most assume it involves some stewardship of nature. However, whose ""nature"" do we mean, especially in an environment so changed by man that some geologists now label it the Anthropocene? Can we ever return to a natural state? Would we want to, given the very real social and biological stressors involved? Finally, given a fundamentalist inclination to return things to ""the way they were"" in politics, religion, and society, what will be our definition of a natural human state? Who will decide? Today the question ""What is the Natural State"" continues to bring in new permutations. Can we return to a natural state, or are we now so inextricably creatures of technology that such a return would doom millions? Why is fundamentalism so powerful in the twenty-first century? Do many want to revert to ""the way it used to be"" because the future terrifies them? Are people ""naturally"" competitors or sharers? How do we reconcile the biocentric and anthropocentric visions of the natural state? Has humanity changed the ""natural state"" too much for any return?  This course was not designed to answer these questions, but it has stimulated conversation and has challenged students to think about their own views of what is ‘natural' in century that will force hard choices about sustainablilty and fundamental stands on what is ‘naturally correct'.",Kimberly Reiter,"International Interdisciplinary Conference for the Environment, Austin, Texas",06/28/2016,,,,,Defining the Natural State: Introducing students to the complexities of sustainability and fundamentalism

Civility is actually the overcoming of the will to power, the natural desire to dominate others, not a mask for covering over that natural political attitude. Without civility, there is only the will to power. And in order for civility to exist, there must be something higher, more important, than politics and the struggle for power. &#x0D; I begin with a brief philosophical history of the virtue of civility.

On the other end of the spectrum is a practice at the heart of the traditional humanities,&#x0D; close reading&#x0D; — the careful,&#x0D; in-depth analysis of a single text in order to extract, engage, and even generate as much productive meaning as possible. The true&#x0D; value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question&#x0D; with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design&#x0D; study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool&#x0D; for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology&#x0D; probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive&#x0D; impact technology can have on poetry scholarship.

9873,HD-228890-15,"Scholars of the ancient world&#x0D;     seeking to understand complex ancient landscapes (both natural&#x0D;     and built) commonly use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to&#x0D;     organize and analyze surveyed or excavated cultural data. GIS&#x0D;     places archaeological information within a two-dimensional (2D)&#x0D;     geospatial framework linked to real locations on the Earth's&#x0D;     surface. Human lives are not lived, however, on a flat surface or&#x0D;     plane, but are embedded within a three-dimensional world.&#x0D;     Archaeologists seeking a more contextualized framework for their&#x0D;     data must add a third coordinate, elevation or height, to their&#x0D;     analysis. Additionally, change over time (the fourth dimension)&#x0D;     is a fundamental aspect of human life, and necessary for any&#x0D;     study that aims to understand human experience in the past. These&#x0D;     elements – height and time – are often neglected in&#x0D;     archaeological GIS projects. The project 3D Saqqara attempts to&#x0D;     create a truly four-dimensional visualization of an ancient&#x0D;     Egyptian site. The project presents a workflow for how 2D&#x0D;     archaeological data can be transformed into 3D representations of&#x0D;     ancient built and natural environments, maintaining the&#x0D;     geo-spatial coordinate system of GIS and allowing for both&#x0D;     quantitative and qualitative visual analysis.  While the project&#x0D;     focuses on Egyptian material, such techniques can be applied by&#x0D;     scholars of the ancient world interested in landscape and human&#x0D;     perception in general.",Elaine Sullivan,"Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) Annual Meeting, San Francisco, CA",01/08/2016,,,,,3D modeling and GIS for temporal visualizations of multi-phased ancient sites

Visual literacy and close looking can help students innovate in any field, yet few have access to this vital training. With assistance from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Plymouth State University, NH, is developing an Applied Visual Literacy Curriculum that will infuse visual analysis skills into at least three preprofessional fields: business, health, and environmental science. The traditional art history major courses—currently organized by historical period and geographic region—will be replaced with a suite of thematic, interdisciplinary courses, including The Business of Art History, Envisioning the Environment, and Bodies of Art. Professors from these areas will collaborate to develop the new classes, creating an authentic blend of the participating discourses. Partnering with popular majors resolves practical enrollment issues in art history, creating a model that can be emulated by other institutions facing similar demographic challenges.

This talk will present research on how representatives of community organizations understand concepts pertaining to social justice. Seven representatives of community-based organizations (CBOs), which included faith organizations, nonprofits, and local government entities, participated in a virtual focus group to discuss concepts pertaining to organizational ethics. During the focus group, participants were asked: ""What is the difference between equality and equity? How do these terms differ from fairness?"" and ""What is justice? What is the distinction between performative justice and transformative justice? How do we know when we are engaging in transformative justice?"" Participants' conversations were video recorded and transcribed. Responses will be analyzed via thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2008). The findings have implications for psychologists working with CBOs to promote organizational and community justice, as well as for organizations looking to develop mission statements and organizational values centered around social justice concepts.","Michele M.

19614,AKA-270131-20,"Community-centered ethical decision-making often fails to capture constituent feedback (Persad, 2017). In contrast, epistemic justice (Fricker, 2007) builds both critical social awareness (Congdon, 2017) and procedural justice (Tyler &amp; Lind, 1988). To better understand community ethics, 23 people representing 17 community-based organizations participated in one of five focus groups. Focus groups lasted two-hours, and four to six participants each. All groups took place via Zoom, and were recorded. Participants discussed a series of questions, including ""What comes to mind when you think of the word ""ethics?"" ""What are the most important ethical values that guide your organization?"" ""Are the values of your organization ever in conflict with each other?"" and ""What values guide your leadership to act in the way they do and/or omit to do?"" Responses were coded using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). The findings indicate participants saw ethics along a multi-dimensional framework which varied along who their organization is accountable to (social norms or the community), the ecological level (society, the organization, or personal ethics), and where priorities are placed. Further, several values associated with ethics were identified, including integrity, equity, power, assumptions that people behave morally, law, and teamwork, among others. These findings indicate both some overlap with White supremacy culture (Okun, n.d.) and departure from it. Findings will be discussed in the context of improving community ethics.","Michele M.

Educators have called for much-needed diversification, flipped the classroom, and weighed the relative merits of chronological versus thematic approaches. However, previous publications and presentations on this topic typically highlight experimentation at the level of individual assignments or specific courses. The present panel expands this discussion to encompass program-wide changes. How are art historians reimagining the curriculum of entire majors, minors, options, certificates, or general education tracks? This is an urgent question at a time when the arts and humanities occupy a precarious position in higher education. Art history programs are adapting in response to shifts in enrollments, institutional priorities, and student demand. Possible solutions may involve strategically consolidating offerings, cross-listing classes with other disciplines, rebranding the major, or creating new interdisciplinary or pre-professional degrees. By sharing examples of how programs have responded to their particular circumstances, others can forge sensible solutions for their own contexts. More than simply reacting to logistical problems in higher education, however, curricular revision provides a valuable opportunity to reconsider the epistemology of art history and its role in the twenty-first-century academy and economy.",Sarah Parrish,,02/11/2021,https://caa.confex.com/caa/2021/webprogrampreliminary/Session8040.html,"Abstract for conference session at leading art history conference, College Art Association.",https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner id/266312/uiconf id/29731991/entry id/1 e72smyzi/embed/dynamic,Video of panel opening remarks.,"""Getting with the Program: Curricular Redesign in Art History,"" panel at College Art Association Annual Conference"

The ideal of integration had seemed, to civil rights advocates, both a logical aspiration and a plausible outcome when the Crawford suit and hundreds of others like it were initiated across the North and West in the early 1960s. Over the course of the 1970s, however, that ideal gradually fell apart. The progressive political goals that inspired powerful elected officials, civil rights lawyers, judges, and others to work toward the creation and enforcement of desegregation laws in the 1950s and 1960s were outmatched in the 1970s by the conjunction of conservatism and racism, which emerged with new energy as part of a nationwide backlash against court-ordered desegregation as it spread beyond the South.

An alternative is to view language as a kind of substance that is constitutive of the individuals and groups involved. But what kind of substance? To answer this question requires shifting attention from a diversity of languages to a diversity of -lects, including shamanic spells and flute music. This opens the way to examining the relation between speech, breath, semen and soul, and to viewing language, music and tobacco smoke as devices that give added substance to breath. In the Vaupés context, in its role as a substance constitutive of persons, language is something that is smeared on the body, trapped in the ears and eaten through the mouth.",Stephen Hugh-Jones,SALSA XIII Biennial Conference: Society for the Anthropology of Lowland South America,06/25/2021,https://www.salsa-tipiti.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SALSA-2021-Conference-Schedule.pdf,"This is the link to the conference schedule, last accessed on 09/24/2021.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y7BjJP7jAQ89LCjmG0YGKLx30hkYXzj50aJY1BvppCI/edit,This is the link to the panel schedule,What viewing language as a substance might tell us about Vaupés multilingualism
19719,PD-260978-18,"Since the 1970s, the Eastern Tukanoan groups living in Colombia and Brazil have been known for generalized multilingualism resulting from their practice of linguistic exogamy (Sorensen 1967; Jackson 1972, 1974, 1983; Hugh-Jones 1979). These groups are patrilineal, patrilocal and, we could say, ‘patrilingual'. In a nuclear family, husband and wife must belong to different patrilineal groups and, therefore, express their affiliation through the exclusive use of their father's language, in spite of the fact that children spend their childhood with women and learn their mother's language first. Several issues concerning the languages involved will be examined. The belief that the father's language is the expression of an individual's essence, reflected in the use of the verb ‘speak' to refer to the father's language but ‘imitate' for the other languages, including the mother's - as do the most traditional groups (Pira-parana river, Colombia). Intensive language contact between groups involved in preferential alliance relationships favors linguistic variation and linguistic acculturation - as in the Barasana and Edúuria case, with ‘languages' sharing the same grammar, differing mainly by their tonal system (Gomez-Imbert 1999). Or an extreme situation, observed in Brazil, where the father's identity language is abandoned in favor of the Tukano language. The marriage of lovers sharing patrilinearity and ‘patrilinguality' is forbidden, incestuous.

This presentation seeks to discourse ethnographic and sociolinguistic elements to broaden the debate on loans and the use of words that exactly reflect this peculiar model of exchanges, a characteristic that identifies them as peoples, at the same time distinct and similar, when seeking to understand more the linguistic and semantic ethnological context of words that are widely used in the Hupd'äh language.

Printed, often hastily, on single sheets of paper, these works portrayed current events in their geographical context. While a few are known depicting non-military events, the vast majority revolve around battles and sieges. This talk focuses on several of the earliest known examples, which were published in Rome and depict clashes between Ottoman and Habsburg forces in Austro-Hungary and the Mediterranean. From these modest origins the genre was soon to explode in popularity, becoming a key early form of the news.

19768,FEL-268066-20,"The paper explores early cinema professionalization through the transmedial career of Russian director Evgenii Bauer, who worked across different arts and practices including amusement gardens, theater scenography, and painting. Specifically, it tracks emancipation of film directing in Bauer's transition from the skills of stage designer to the crafts of film director as a profession, emerging circa the early 1910s. I argue that Bauer's role as a set designer, that included more than twenty years in the pictorial theater of operetta-féerie,and his techniques in the fabricated environment are crucial for shaping a new profession of film director. I further argue that the set design practice functioned simultaneously as a juncture of these two professions and a site of their separation. Considering Bauer's innovation in theater scenography – a reform of the stage wings that reveals a departure from the conception of space, offered by the post-Renaissance theater and dominated by the central axis – I survey how his architecture of the film set plays with materiality of various surfaces such as glass and gauze. I finally claim that Bauer's conception of the set as a designed milieu converged with the privileging of mood, while his techniques, especially the veil effect, became technologies of atmosphere and markers of the film director's craft.",Oksana Chefranova,DOMITOR 2020,11/17/2020,https://domitor2020.org/en-ca/techniques-of-set-design-technologies-of-atmosphere-professionalization-of-film-director-in-early-russian-cinema/,,,,"TECHNIQUES OF SET DESIGN, TECHNOLOGIES OF ATMOSPHERE: PROFESSIONALIZATION OF FILM DIRECTOR IN EARLY RUSSIAN CINEMA"

19803,FEL-267498-20,"This essay explores the discursive means by which ingrained trajectories of medical knowledge and practice have been re-envisioned and recalibrated in U.S. history. It takes for its case study the development of the field of fertility science and medicine, which is an outgrowth of Dr. J. Marion Sims's notorious, nineteenth-century gynecological tradition of invasive and injurious surgeries targeting the female body. More specifically, this essay offers a critical-comparative analysis of Sims's mid-to-late-nineteenth-century medical publications and Dr. Sophia Kleegman's mid-twentieth-century medical publications to highlight the differing pedagogies of sight at work therein. The analysis reveals that—in contrast to the objectivist, myopic, and exclusively female-focused visual pedagogy that Sims articulated—Kleegman's pedagogy provided disciplinary readers with a distinct, ""conservative surgery"" hermeneutic for scientific study and treatment that illuminated new diagnostic heuristics related to the proximity of pain, the scale of efficiency, and the boundaries of corporality and expertise. In this way, Kleegman's articles instantiated an alternative disciplinary optics that balanced past ways of seeing with emergent, ethically calibrated modes of clinical judgement. Ultimately, this technical intervention into medical vision facilitated the realization of increasingly humane and effective practices across reproductive medicine and fertility science beginning in the mid-to-late-twentieth century.",Robin E.

These factors enabled many cultural, journalistic, and humanities organizations to create unique audiovisual documentation for the first time. This format, however, was not commonly used for media distribution, thus a collected DV tape is very likely a camera original or a unique recording rather than a copy. While cheap and tiny, DV tape is far more susceptible to contamination, damage, decay, and environmental factors than other videotape formats from the same time period and there are few resources or tools to support the migration of data fromDV tapes Due to abandonment by market forces, the major software options for migrating DV tape are all now unavailable. This poses a tremendous preservation risk, as DV contains a wealth of metadata (including validation checks) allowing the results of a data transfer to be easily assessed. If captured digitally, the DV videodeck leaves thorough documentation within the resulting DV file regarding the success and failure of its transfer.  Falling in between the substantial eras of analog video tape and digital audiovisual files, DV tape was a transitional format which has not been sufficiently addressed by research and development in audiovisual preservation. Whereas preservation communities bring substantial expertise on the digitization of analog videotape and on the preservation of digital files, there are few resources or tools to support the migration of data from the surfaces of DV tapes into digital files. DV Rescue, a NEH-funded project, is an attempt to address this need via research and tool development focused specifically towards rescuing the content of DV tapes.

In 2016 the FAIR principles were introduced [MW16]: Research data and its metadata have to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Linked Data is an essential part of the FAIR principles: ""TheSemantic Web isn't just about putting data on the web. It is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. [TBL06]."" Publishing research data as HTTP URIs with RDF content containing links to other resources makes data FAIR! On top of that, these data should be open for access, re-use and universal participation. A five star rating system of openness [MH12] was introduced to rate Linked Data, i.e. ""Linked Open Data (LOD) is Linked Data which is released under an open licence. [TBL06]. "" Furthermore, LOD have to be usable for scientists and programmers to take advantage of all the LOD power. Following the LOUD principles[RS18] will make LOD even more FAIR. Merging all these principles to create FAIR and LOUD research data results in the Sphere 7 Data Model, which enables a wide array of digital humanities and archaeological (web-)applications using LOUD and FAIR data.

These are the two most prominent archaeology membership organizations in the United States, and it is clear that computation methodologies in scholarship and dissemination are increasingly in the mainstream in archaeology as a whole, and no longer a niche within certain departments; digital tools are inseparable from analog ones in cataloging and analyzing information and publishing new knowledge. In order to remain apace of these changes, it is also incumbent upon digital publishers to alter their workflows so that the scholarly profile of an academic can be populated and each contributor recognized for his or her work.

In line with these initiatives is the creation of student-based corpora of U.S. Spanish (e.g., Corpus of Mexican Spanish in Salinas, Spanish in Texas, Corpus de Español en el Sur de Arizona, Corpus Bilingüe del Valle), in which students take part in building sociolinguistic corpora. Student-based US Spanish corpora not only provide important data for variationist research including the opportunity to analyze changes in progress (Torres Cacoullos &amp; Berry, forthcoming), but also provide students with training in sociolinguistic methods. This hands-on approach in turn raises sociolinguistic awareness among students, especially among minority language speakers whose native dialects are often seen as mixed hybrids.

The researchers compared baseline transcripts from the two voice recognition software methods to a corrected version of the transcript for each audio file to derive measures of accuracy. Averaged together across interviews, there was an average accuracy rate of 26% for Audio from Speaker (SpeechNotes) and 65% for auto-generated (Stream), leading us to discard SpeechNotes as a viable option. In a follow up study during Spring 2021, 33 students participated in a sociolinguistic field methods course that focused on the development of sociolinguistic corpora at the two universities. Overall, students reported that 10 minutes of transcription took them approximately 3 hours and 24 minutes for the manual (ExpressScribe) and 2 hours for the auto-generated transcript revision (Stream). Students also widely preferred the auto-generated transcription method for its speed and ease of use.

19931,RA-235170-16,"South Asian historiography, which often takes as the bounds of its political imagination the geographical limits of state power, has been peculiarly blind to regions like the Konkan coast of western India, whose political fragmentation belie other forms of regional integration. This coast was, and is, the borderland mediating between the vast world of the Indian Ocean, and the mercantile, diasporic, ecumenical and imperial networks that operated within it, and the interior of the South Asian subcontinent. Despite its clear historical import, the coast has escaped the notice of historians as a coherent cultural region, due to its perennial political fragmentation. This paper presents an overview of a monograph project, which draws upon both early modern archival and ethnographic research to show how the Konkan must be understood as an interconnected and coherent region for both South Asian and Indian Ocean history. I focus in particular on two groups of mobile peoples and two cultural phenomena in demonstrating the regional coherence of the Konkan zone: 1) slaves and the Konkani migrant community of Kochi, Kerala and 2) deities of place and the Konkani language.

20065,PD-266994-19,"Early colonial records suggest that an extensive trade network linked the two major branches of the Amazon River, the Rio Negro and the Solimões, with the Jurubaxí River and adjacent southern tributaries of the Rio Negro playing a key role as connecting interfluvial routes. The area of the Rio Negro was dominated by Arawakan peoples, most notably the powerful Manao, who controlled the lower to middle reaches of the Rio Negro, as well as by allied groups inhabiting the upper reaches and various tributaries (Sweet 1975, Wright 2005). The Solimões, in turn, was controlled nearly to its mouth by the Tupi-Guaranian Omagua and Yurimagua peoples. However, the degree to which these exchange networks incorporated local peoples is not well understood, and most of the groups involved had already been decimated and absorbed into the local caboclo population by the mid-18th century, in the wake of epidemics, slaving, and wars of extermination carried out by the Portuguese. Similarly, the majority of the languages once spoken throughout this region have had no speakers for centuries, and disappeared with no or minimal documentation. A key exception is the Nadëb, a people who still inhabit the interfluvial zone in the region of the Jurubaxí and neighboring rivers, and whose language belongs to the Naduhup family, associated with forest-dwelling hunters throughout the region. In this paper, we draw on our current work with Nadëb to consider linguistic clues to their role as intermediaries in past systems of exchange, informed by triangulation with historical and ethnohistorical evidence. As we explore here, indications of extensive lexical and grammatical borrowing from Tupi-Guaranian and Arawakan sources suggest that the Nadëb were deeply involved in local networks, and provide further insights into the dynamics of those networks themselves.","Nian Pissolati, Epps, Patience, Obert, Karolin, Emily Luedke, Mark Simmons",Meeting of the Society for the Anthropology of Lowland South America,06/29/2021,,,,,Footprints of pre-Columbian trade networks?

20066,PD-266994-19,"Nominal classification is a robust feature in many Amazonian languages, and aspects of these systems offer significant challenges to our broader conception of the phenomenon. Yet a clear characterization of Amazonian classification systems must be firmly grounded in detailed descriptive analysis on one hand, and in a principled definition of classification as a typological category on the other – and a failure to do so may lead to spurious claims of typological rara. This paper offers a case in point through an exploration of nominal classification phenomena in the small Naduhup family (aka Makú; Brazil/Colombia): while several aspects of these systems have been highlighted in the typological literature as rare or otherwise remarkable, a reconsideration of these phenomena in the light of more data and analysis suggests significant revisions. We consider nominal classification phenomena across the four languages (Hup, Yuhup, Dâw, Nadëb) from synchronic and diachronic perspectives, and reassess their relevance for a broader typology of classification.","Obert, Karolin, Epps, Patience","Amazonicas VIII conference, Universidade de Brasília",06/02/2021,,,,,Naduhup languages and the typology of nominal classification
20067,PD-266994-19,"In northwestern Amazonia and beyond, many minority language communities are experiencing profound cultural and linguistic change. Such change often takes the form of language endangerment, most obviously in cases where the community language ceases to be passed on to children. However, processes of endangerment are complex: even where the everyday language is robustly transmitted, other aspects of language form and usage may still undergo change and/or loss in the context of external pressure – genres, registers, styles, and even structural features, all of which are components of global linguistic diversity and of speakers' cultural and linguistic heritage.  Such is the situation of Nadëb, a member of the small Naduhup family with about 400 speakers, as it is spoken in the community of Roçado (Amazonas state, Brazil). While Nadëb is still being passed robustly to children in Roçado, community members are well aware that transmission is faltering in some neighboring communities. They are also aware of changes in discursive practice in their own community, some of which are associated with a recent shift to evangelical Christianity, accompanied by a full translation of the New Testament into Nadëb. In this talk, we draw on collaborative fieldwork with the Nadëb people of Roçado to consider speakers' experiences with endangerment and contact-driven change as realized in grammatical structure – an area which tends to be less salient to speakers than are other targets of shift and change (see e.g. Silverstein 1981). As we explore here, speakers may nonetheless attend to structural changes, and may assess them in light of the contexts and practices that drive them.  From a typological perspective, one of Nadëb's most striking structural features is its preference for OAV constituent order, which is cross-linguistically very rare (see Weir 1984, 1986; Dryer 2013). As contact with Portuguese increases, one might anticipate pressure for Nadëb's secondary order – AVO – to","Mark Simmons, Patience Epps, Emily Luedke, Karol Obert",Workshop on American Indian Languages,04/30/2021,,,,,Constituent disorder? Community perspectives on sentence structure in Nadëb.
20068,PD-266994-19,"The Naduhup language family, located in northwest Amazonia, has four members: Hup, Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadëb, of which Nadëb is the most distantly related sister (Epps &amp; Bolaños 2017). Despite a strong signal of cognacy in basic vocabulary, the four languages are highly divergent in their grammatical profiles and morphological forms – particularly so for Nadëb. This divergence probably has much to do with their diverse contact histories, and has likely been facilitated by structural properties that feed grammaticalization, such as noun incorporation and verb serialization (see e.g. Epps &amp; Ananthanarayan forthcoming). In light of the diversity of its argument marking resources, the Naduhup family offers an intricate historical puzzle in its own right, which in turn provides insights into the diachrony of argument marking more generally. Despite their apparent recency, the historical sources of the core argument markers are not fully clear; however, those in Hup and Nadëb may represent an extension of directional and locational functions, respectively. For non-core arguments, the development of a more generic oblique suffix (-Vt) in Hup and Yuhup has probably been areally motivated via contact with Tukanoan languages (see Aikhenvald 2002 for a similar development in Tariana, Arawakan), and may derive from hut, a variant still attested in Yuhup. Similarly, Nadëb's development of pronominal subject-marking is a likely reflection of contact, involving Arawakan languages. Several postpositions show some evidence of cognacy across the family, as indicated in Table 2 above, while others may be innovations, although there is little evidence for non-adpositional sources. Finally, Nadëb has undergone a further historical stage in which the incorporation of a number of postpositions into the verb phrase has given rise to a set of verbal prefixes (example 1; see Weir 1986).","Epps, Patience","Workshop on Diachrony, Adpositions, Nuclear and Oblique Arguments, University of Sonora",11/12/2020,,,,,The diachrony of argument marking in Naduhup (NW Amazonia).

Vices can practically disable an agent for acting well on account of motivational and cognitive dispositions shaping necessities and impossibilities (even though the vicious agent does not strive to be disabled for right action). The explication of character-based necessity shows how practical necessity and impossibility can become durable, significant features of character as a result of voluntary activity even if the acquisition of those features was not intended.

10037,FB-52344-06,"One of the most popular and long-lived approaches to naturalizing the mind is the attempt to reduce mental phenomena to physical, biological, or neural phenomena. Reductionism has held a special allure among philosophers for a number of reasons: the intuitive appeal of part-whole explanations, reductive explanation's resemblance to the axiomatic method in mathematics, its apparent promise as a strategy for unifying different knowledge domains, and the fact that true reductions, when successful, are almost unique in yielding both metaphysical necessity and complete explanations. Reductionism was a very influential view in philosophy of science, both in early modernity and through much of the twentieth century, and some central contemporary issues in philosophy of mind -- the explanatory gap and the hard problem of consciousness -- are framed as claims that conscious mental states (and perhaps they alone) are not reducible to physical phenomena. In fact, however, most philosophers of science today would agree that true intertheoretic reductions are rare even in the natural sciences. I propose an explanation of both the appeal and the failure of reductionism in terms of a cognitivist approach to philosophy of science called Cognitive Pluralism, and then explore what implications post-reductionist philosophy of science has for philosophy of mind. If it is ""explanatory gaps all the way down,"" what are the implications for dualism and for reductive, non-reductive and eliminative physicalisms? Is the mind-matter gap different than other explanatory gaps? And, if the Cognitive Pluralist analysis is correct, is there any hope more generally for a unified science, or that scientific theories generally can provide answers to metaphysical questions?",Steven Horst,Mind-Matter Research Society (Annual Meeting),3/17/2014,,,,,Beyond Reduction: From Naturalism to Cognitive Pluralism

10063,FB-55612-11,"One of the more controversial doctrines in the Dvaita or ‘dualist' system of Vedanta thought is the belief that souls in the state of mok?a experience hierarchical degrees of bliss. This concept of moksataratamya was first articulated by the Dvaita movement's 13th-century founder, Madhva. In keeping with his realist epistemology and pluralistic ontology, Madhva maintained that souls possess innate capacities or ‘yogyatas' that predestine them to achieve not only specific but stratified soteriological ends. It is perhaps unsurprising that modern critics have objected that this doctrine potentially lends eternal validity to conservative Hindu social hierarchies, which often restricted access to moksa to male elites. But traditional critics also pointed out the doctrine's inherent unfairness, particularly its problematic implication of God's partiality. In the final chapter of his polemical text, the Nyayam?ta or Nectar of Logic, the sixteenth-century Dvaita polemicist Vyasatirtha defends this doctrine of moksataratamya largely by flipping the issue of fairness on its head. As part of a larger doxographic project, Vyasatirtha surveys a variety of ideas within Hinduism about how to achieve liberation from samsara. These ideas range from Vedanta prerequisites of Vedic study to Puranic traditions about achieving mok?a through hatred of God (i.e., ""dvesabhakti"") to popular notions of achieving moksa merely by dying in a holy city. Vyasatirtha argues that the relative difficulty of these various sadhanas (or ""means to mok?a"") necessitates hierarchy within mok?a. After all, it is only fair that those who have used a more challenging method should be rewarded with a better form of mok?a than those who took an easier, or, a less wholesome route.",Valerie Stoker,"The South Asia Conference, Madison, Wisconsin",10/22/15,,,,,The Social Life of Vedanta Philosophy: Vyasatirtha on Hierarchy in Moksha
10064,AQ-50581-12,"Smith argues that resentment has a crucial role in sustaining the determination to see that justice is done. He says, ""It is the safeguard of justice and the security of innocence."" No doubt, there are ways in which resentment can become toxic and morally problematic. Indeed, many thinkers urge the minimization of resentment because of how corrupting it can easily become or how corrupting it is alleged to be in its own right. Smith's view of resentment suggests an epistemic role and a motivational role for it. Resentment can be an appropriate expression of denunciation of the wrong done, reflecting a correct perception of it, and it can sustain the commitment to see that justice is served. Is Smith correct that the moral psychology of resentment has an important role in regard to criminal justice? How are we to understand resentment in the larger context of Smith's views about sympathy, imagination, and sociability? Is there tension between resentment's role vis a vis criminal justice and a liberal polity's concern to sustain an open, tolerant, pluralistic civil society?",Jonathan Jacobs,Joint Meeting of Adam Smith Society and Rousseau Association,07/22/2015,,,,,“Adam Smith on Resentment and Gratitude: The Moral Psychology of Justice and Civility”

Others before me have certainly noted the incongruity of Louis being employed as a symbol of American democracy when he, as a black man, suffered the injustices of Jim Crow inequality.  In this paper, however, I argue that the common embrace of Louis as the nation's standard-bearer in fact reinforced the racial schism evident in America.  &#x0D; In an ironic twist, Louis's fight against Schmeling provided white Americans with the ammunition with which they could claim U.S. superiority over fascism while permitting them to not actually improve conditions for black Americans.

With fascism on the rise in Europe and the world teetering on the brink of war, Americans' increasingly vociferous condemnation of the Nazis' racist creed smacked uncomfortably of hypocrisy.  Gradually, beginning with academics and social progressives, Americans began to reexamine their own system of beliefs about racial hierarchy and even to challenge the precepts underlying Jim Crow segregation.  &#x0D; Anxious to affirm the preeminence of democracy, particularly in the face of anti-discrimination protest emerging from the black population in the form of A.

10086,FB-52226-06,"This paper examines the twentieth century evolution of the expression of racial inequality through the prism of Joe Louis' experience as both a boxer and an icon. The study of sports in the United States offers a particularly effective mechanism for challenging the Whiggish assertion that race relations have been inexorably improving, with sports purportedly offering incontrovertible evidence of that trend. Americans' desperate yearning to sound the death-knell of racial strife can be seen in the popularity of films such as Remember the Titans (2000) that depict sports as the altar on which racism has died.&#x0D; Joe Louis' story exposes the fallacy of this contention. Despite Louis' unprecedented popularity among whites, that fact never contravened pervasive assumptions about black inferiority.  The interdictions on Louis' behavior, the stereotyped portrayals of him during his reign as champion, and the modern-day appropriations of his image expose a persistent unwillingness to view Louis, or other black people, as full-fledged equals.

In particular, there has been little attempt to interrogate the long-term (1918–today) discursive construction of Yugoslav identity by means of collective memory—that is, the selectively shared stories people tell about themselves in order to give meaning to the ‘nation,' a sense of belonging to the ‘national culture.' And yet from the moment Yugoslavia was created, ordinary Yugoslavists began constructing the Sarajevo assassination as a heroic narrative of opposition and liberation that transcended the particularist identities of ethnicity, nation, religion, and history.

The talk will describe the research methodology used to compile this information, and then correlate art market turnover with French GDP. The findings will be interpreted in light of both the political upheavals and financial crises that afflicted the era.

10178,FA-54864-09,"In Tunisia, trance rituals animated by praise songs to Sufi saints are not exclusive to members of Sufi orders or participants in Sufi ceremonies. Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, those of women, Jews, blacks, and hard-drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical ""journey"" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community. This paper emphasizes the important role of women and minorities in cultivating Sufi aesthetics, and shows how Sufism resonates throughout Tunisian society via listening publics associated with numerous genres of music—both ""sacred"" and ""secular""—that evoke the spiritual and therapeutic power of music and trance. Based on ethnographic research between 2009 and 2015, this presentation takes as its starting point the changing politico-religious climate after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 and the concomitant threats to the survival of musical practices associated with Muslim saints.",Richard Jankowsky,Society for Ethnomusicology Annual Conference,11/11/2016,,,,,Ritual Journeys and Devotional Niches: Ambient Sufism in Tunisia

20255,FT-264476-19,"Itamar Even-Zohar has queried, what if the translated work maintains the central position within a literary polysystem and influences the literary history of another country? Ernest Hemingway was ""rediscovered"" during Nikita Khrushchev's reengagement with the West and became a ubiquitous cultural figure with his portrait found in Soviet apartments during the 1960s and ‘70s. Ivan Kashkin and his school of translators first offered Hemingway to Soviet readers in 1934, but it was his posthumously published Ernest Hemingway. A Critical-Biographical Study (1966), which significantly informed the first Soviet biography (1970) of the American author. In this paper, I will focus on Kashkin and this late-Soviet version of Hemingway. Kashkin had equated the inner lives of Hemingway's characters with the author himself. As a result, when Soviet readers found characters who directly reflected their own outlook on life, their inner world seemed to align with Hemingway's. Readers could empathize with Hemingway in ways that they might not with Count Lev Tolstoi or the cosmopolitan writer Il'ia Ehrenburg. Because this reading was so personalized, there was a connection with an author who also offered an escape from the Soviet reality.   In 1985, Sergei Davlotov argued that Hemingway had somehow become embedded in various spheres of daily Soviet life. His books were prominently displayed in most homes of the Soviet intelligentsia. His portraits frequently appeared in popular journals. For a generation of Soviet youth, it was even trendy to quote from Hemingway's works. Despite the dissimilarities, Hemingway had become a Soviet writer.",Frederick H.

He was assigned the codename ""Argo"" and met with Soviet agents several times in the following years, but never provided the Soviets with any valuable information. In this paper, I will suggest a plausible answer for why Hemingway might have worked with the NKVD.  During the Spanish Civil War, Hemingway was friends with the Soviet documentarian Roman Karmen, journalists Mikhail Kol'tsov and Ilya Ehrenburg, NKVD Station Chief Alexander Orlov and others. I will concentrate on Hemingway's relationship with Kol'tsov to suggest that that Hemingway had benefited greatly from this relationship and possibly saw his work with the NKVD as a continuation of his work in Spain.",Frederick H.

20276,AQ-50184-10,"This paper considers two points about teaching chivalry. First, chivalry is often taught essentially as a charming theory of behavior, but what happens when reality meets theory is explored far less. Second, though chivalry and just war tradition each played a major role in medieval society, they are often inexplicably separated. To address these points, this paper treats the pairing of chivalry and just war in the classroom context of medieval applications (ius in bello). The paper draws from my experiences teaching the standard medieval history survey, an upper-division crusades course, and a ""History of Just War"" seminar funded by my National Endowment for the Humanities Enduring Questions Pilot Course Grant (2010-2012) for the project, ""Is there such a thing as a just war?"" Case studies include student research projects on Richard I's slaughter of Muslim prisoners at Acre, crusades events from Muslim and Christian perspectives, and Joan of Arc's leadership. The paper also revisits my article, ""Chivalry: A Door to Teaching the Middle Ages,"" The History Teacher 28 (1995), published before the post-9/11 perspective that, for better and worse, is the major prism through which students view these issues, often with a presentist or ahistorical lens.",Christopher M.

20330,FA-252317-17,"Two rural traditions of sung poetry in Timor—separated by 300 kilometers and belonging to different language families—exhibit similar processes of poetic fragmentation.  In both traditions, the poems are couplets, but each tradition has its own metrical pattern, applied uniformly to every line.  Couplets, chosen extemporaneously by the singers, are sung to strophic melodies, one line per strophe.  Each tradition's invariable meter divides the lines of poetic text into units, which, in singing, are interspersed among vocables and extraneous words that are fixed, always the same and falling in the same places in every statement of the melody.  Thus there are two levels of sung text: the poetic text, changing with every strophe, and the melodic text, which belongs to the melody and must be repeated every time.  Any couplet may be sung to any melody, but every melody has its own template of melodic text, so the same couplet will be realized differently in different melodies.  Between couplets, singers may shift from one melody to another; this entails switching templates, which constitutes a challenge and, I suggest, an aesthetic pleasure.  A search in the literature has yet to turn up counterparts to this system, but often published studies of sung poetry give ""fillers"" short shrift, leaving it unclear whether they are fixed and requisite elements or casual and variable insertions.  So, two questions: is this interweaving of fixed melodic text and changing poetic text known in other traditions?  And how could such a counterintuitive system come about?",Philip Yampolsky,Society for Ethnomusicology 2021 Annual Meeting,10/28/2021,,,,,Poetic text vs. melodic text in the sung poetry of Timor
20331,FA-252317-17,"While solo singing and singing in monophonic or heterophonic choruses are common throughout Island Southeast Asia (and polyphonic choruses are also found, though less frequently), singing in polyphonic duet is extremely rare.  It is known only in two circumscribed regions in the islands—one on Flores and one, some 450 km to the east, on Timor—and also, farther afield (another 2,270 km east from Timor), in the Manus Islands east of New Guinea.  All three traditions are characterized not only by the duet format itself, but by the pervasive presence of harmonic seconds (major, minor, and approximate), and the duets of Flores and Timor—although practiced by speakers of contrasting language families—have many other similarities as well.  (The Melanesian tradition, with fewer similarities to the others, may for the purposes of our presentation be considered an outlier.)  The presence of two geographically separate traditions, strongly resembling each other but remarkably different from any other (known) traditions in the 17,000 islands of the region, presents what Rappoport calls (2010) an enigma. We propose to offer, in a combined, double-length paper, a detailed analytical comparison of the duet traditions of Flores and Timor.

20387,FT-264551-19,"How can we excavate experiences of enslaved people from archives that systematically exclude enslaved voices, while negotiating the demands of a liberal sensibility that requires subjects to speak for themselves? In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan. They had been caught, terrifyingly, between two factions struggling over who would succeed their dead master, a Né (or Yi) native hereditary chieftain, as the sovereign of his extensive domain. Their plaint, which named the slaves as its collective author, was written in Chinese, a language they could neither speak nor write. This paper traces their footsteps as they accompanied their master's widow to the prefectural capital, found a cut-rate litigation master to fashion their plaint, then dispersed through the city on errands for their master's widow. I think about how the slaves' own form of spatial literacy, developed through their service in their master's house and participation in his rituals, might have helped them read and navigate the unfamiliar city. Thinking through the specificities of how slaves became writers and readers also helps better delineate the shape of slavery in Né places, which have served as China's designated ""slave societies,"" despite widespread slavery in every region and economic sector of the Empire. I argue that the native chieftain system itself became a system of bondage in Qing society, confining Né and other ‘non-Chinese' to mountain enclaves while extracting their wealth and using their lives in military actions.",Erik Mueggler,"Association for Asian Studies annual conference, 2021",03/24/2021,https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2021 AAS Program 0324.pdf,Conference program,https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2021 AAS Program 0324.pdf,Conference program,"Rewriting Bondage: Literacy and Slavery in a Native Domain, Southwest China."

20758,RQ-266249-19,"This paper argues that Gershwin's An American in Paris is a modernist musical manifesto—a statement of the composer's ambition to write musically sophisticated yet accessible music that made money. It examines Gershwin's work from three perspectives: as popular modernism, as a synthesis of program and absolute musics, and as an exemplar of Gershwin's economics. Sources include an overlooked 1920 Gershwin interview, discoveries from the work's new critical edition, and financial documents from contemporary newspapers and the Library of Congress. It concludes that Gershwin's music is more modern and compositionally rich than typically understood, while serving to make classical music pay.",Mark Clague,46th Annual Conference of the Society for American Music,07/16/2020,file:///Users/andrewkohler/Downloads/3c ClagueMark Abstract.pdf,Link to abstract.,https://www.american-music.org/page/SAM2020ProgramLive-Thurs,Link to conference program.,A Modernist Manifesto: Reconsidering George Gershwin’s An American in Paris
20797,RZ-271273-20,"ABSTRACT OF ""GOING TO JACKSON: the Mississippi State Hospital in Faulkner and Welty""  Since opening its doors in Jackson in 1855, the Mississippi State Hospital has played a powerful role in the public imagination as reflected in The Sound and the Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930), The Ponder Heart (1953) and several of Welty's short stories.  As a variation on the southern gothic mansion, the ""lunatic asylum"" in Faulkner and Welty mocks and mirrors institutions—plantation house, hotel, bank, church, courthouse, the Old Ladies Home, and prison.  In sending their protagonists by train to Jackson, the authors question definitions of sanity, the role of the exiled artist, and race relations of the post-bellum south.  More particularly, we see how the fate of Welty's Uncle Daniel Ponder is in part a reply to Faulkner's Benjy Compson and Darl Bundren.  Amid scenes of humor, violence, and sexuality, the historical State Hospital is transformed into a potent symbol of social change and individual conscience.  AUTHOR BIO Michael Gleason has been introducing Millsaps undergrads to Homer, Virgil, and Beowulf since 1994.

20824,FEL-267748-20,"The Legal Authority of Merchants and Brokers in India's French Courts The importance of commercial brokers to the trading world of the eighteenth century, and especially the Indian Ocean, has long been recognized. Through their familial, religious, linguistic, and generational connections, such brokers were at the absolute center of globe-spanning networks of commercial exchange. This paper examines how comercial brokers and other merchants engaged with the French Compagnie des Indes in India were also crucial legal agents in Pondichéry's French-run courts. Although these courts were staffed by French colonial officials, and dispensed law according to legal codes imported from Paris, commercial brokers and other local merchants were responsible for bringing forward suits, managing their evolution during witness testimonies, and even making decisions regarding sentencing and punishment. Their unofficial roles in French-arbitrated legal matters were recognized and eagerly encouraged by the colony's French courts. Focusing on a 1743 criminal litigation by the Pondichéry Superior Council regarding the trafficking and enslavement of a large group of Indian men, women and children by a French trader and his local broker, this paper shows how ostensibly French law, derived from metropolitan codes, was enmeshed in the same familial and linguistic networks that facilitated trade in a French colonial city on the Coromandel Coast.",Danna Agmon,"Nodes of Early Modern Capitalism, European University Institute, Florence",11/23/2021,,,,,The Legal Authority of Merchants and Brokers in India’s French Courts

However, promotion of narrowly epistemic goals cannot be the only function of a healthy epistemic practice.  Human community—indeed, rational agency itself—cannot exist without a vast store of common ground: shared background beliefs about norms and institutions, but also factual beliefs about the shared world we inhabit.  Given this, it follows that a central function of any society's epistemic practice must be doxastic coordination—that is, the production of consensus sufficient to enable community, communication, and coordination.",Jeremy Koons,Why and How We Give and Ask For Reasons: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives,10/19/2021,https://www.uhk.cz/en/philosophical-faculty/about-faculty/departments/department-of-philosophy-and-social-sciences/news/a,conference site,,,"“Doxastic Coordination and the Social Function of Reason-Giving,”"
20890,FS-261503-18,"Traditional analyses of knowledge (such as JTB+ conceptions of knowledge, and even many conceptions from within the social epistemology tradition) treat knowledge as an individual status or state, analyzable largely in terms of individual epistemic agents.  I argue that most knowledge is better represented as a collective resource—literally, a commons (in the traditional sense of a resource that is available and usable by an entire community).  Further, to the extent that we can talk about knowledge as something possessed by individual agents, such possession will usually be not merely causally but instead logically dependent upon the existence of the knowledge commons.  Thus, individual instances of knowing are generally strongly parasitic on the existence of the knowledge commons. Previous work on knowledge as a commons has overwhelmingly addressed itself to a specific issue, namely, the ‘fencing off' of the commons represented by placing knowledge (such as academic articles) behind paywalls.  I instead propose to pursue the more radical understanding of the knowledge commons outlined above.  It will turn out that understanding knowledge in this way forces us to reconceive of much of our epistemic practice, including the very goal of epistemic assessment itself.",Jeremy Koons,"Reasons, Rationality, and Culture Workshop",10/15/2021,https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/tilps/calendar/rrc-workshop,conference website,,,"""Knowledge as a Commons"""
20891,FS-261503-18,"Bernard Williams's essay ""Internal and External Reasons"" presents a now-classic challenge to the categorical bindingness of moral reasons. I argue that for Sellars, moral reasons are internal (in Williams's sense), but nevertheless categorically valid for rational beings. This conclusion follows largely because of Sellars's radically social conception of reasons. Reasons internalism is often tied to the Humean theory of reasons (HTR). Sellars's anti-reductionist and anti-individualist conception of reasons presents a powerful challenge to the HTR: A significant range of reasons have a social and intersubjective dimension that resists a Humean analysis. Indeed, most reasons we have display this anti-Humean character; and to focus only on reasons that admit of a Humean, individualistic analysis is to leave us with a violently truncated agent—indeed, one who might not even be a rational agent. The intermediate conclusion is that most reasons are social—we are subject to them not qua individuals but qua members of a society, occupying various roles and identities. The strategy suggested by Sellars's approach—which holds to the inherently social nature of reasons—is to argue that reasons are already, by their nature, inherently public; that to occupy the standpoint of rational agency is to occupy the standpoint of the ‘we' and to be bound by its norms, including its moral norms.",Jeremy Koons,"Ethics, Practical Reasoning, Agency: Sellars’s Practical Philosophy",8/12/2021,https://www.gvsu.edu/sellars-conference/,Conference website,,,Sellars on External Reasons

These editions include hymnals created by and for Black, white, and Native American communities in the US South and its diasporas between the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. All are part of Sounding Spirit, a National Endowment for the Humanities–funded research lab that publishes scholarly editions and thematic collections examining race, place, religion, and culture in southern vernacular sacred music publishing. The hymnals included in Sounding Spirit feature diverse genres ranging from gospel to spirituals, dispersed harmony to ""scientific"" music. The editions, which pair high resolution page images with critical introductions and contextual annotations, analyze how these hymnals refracted the racial politics of the US South and its diasporas. The sacred music making represented by these works was connected to oppressive structures of slavery, Jim Crow, and Indian Removal. Hymnals also furthered resistance to racial discrimination in connection with the establishment of Black denominations and colleges and document complex relationships to settler colonial missionizing among Native Americans through hymn translation and composition.

This kechi was not the resurrection of earlier strategies to survive dire hardship born of the necessity of survival, but a ""bright"" and ""new"" stinginess that was repurposed as a means to maintain the middle class aspirations and achievements of the ""bright life"" at a time when the possibility and temptation to be wasteful were real.  This remaking of kechi reflected the practices, characteristics, and concerns of an affluent, mass consumption, middle class society; rested on certain assumptions about the relationship between material comfort and happiness; and revealed the depth and tenacity of the values forged in the making of a wealthy Japan.",Eiko Maruko Siniawer,European Association of Japanese Studies,08/29/2014,,,,,"""A Bright New Stinginess: Waste Consciousness in the 1970s"""
10201,FB-55583-11,"With the Garbage War of 1971 and the Oil Shock of 1973, issues of waste and wastefulness were catapulted to a place of visibility unprecedented in the postwar period, to the nexus of interconnected and interwoven conversations about rubbish, resources, energy, environmental awareness, consumption, and economic growth.  This presentation examines two dimensions—the significant shifts as well as the undercurrent of continuity—to the conceptions of waste and waste consciousness in the 1970s.  On the one hand, the jolts early in the decade helped inspire the idea that waste and wasting were the result of the high growth era with its promotion of a mass consumption society and culture of disposability.  Garbage was no longer considered an inconvenient byproduct of economic success, but a problem that required a rethinking of values and priorities that came to be seen as wasteful.  Practices of reuse, recycling, and the saving of resources and energy were actively promoted.  On the other hand, such substantial shifts and developments were moderated, challenged, and perhaps even undermined by the abiding allure of the conveniences, comforts, and pleasures of affluent, mass-consuming, middle-class lifestyles.  Waste consciousness was not to compromise standards of living or to dramatically change consumers' preferences and behavior.  What this presentation would like to suggest is that these conceptions of waste and wastefulness reveal a fundamental tension in the 1970s between profound skepticism about the promises of economic growth and the tenacity of the values, desires, and ways of life forged in the making of an affluent Japan.",Eiko Maruko Siniawer,"Japan History Group, University of Tokyo",06/09/2016,,,,,"""Reconsidering Affluence: Waste and Waste Consciousness in the 1970s"""

10229,HR-50399-08,"The same space could be simultaneously assigned multiple and even conflicting values reflecting the aspirations and agendas of different observers. At the same time, the same space could acquire different meanings in the eyes of the same beholder. Personal experiences and mutating historical circumstances determined how the same person would relate to the same space at different points in time. The production of space, in other words, was open-ended even when it was not multi-vocal.  This paper uses the poems, letters, and diaries of the Fukuoka poet, nun, and loyalist Nomura Boto (1806-67) to examine the various meanings she attached to her retreat in Hirao. Boto moved to the retreat in 1845. Over the next twenty years, in parallel with changes in her personal life and in the political landscape of the country writ large, the Hirao retreat came to symbolize escapism and engagement, loss and gain, the unbearable sadness of the present and the uplifting joy of timelessness. While Boto reinvented the space of the retreat many times over, I suggest that the opposite was also true: the space transformed Boto in return, affording her opportunities that her physical body otherwise denied her and enabling her to transition from one phase of her life to the next. The production of space was thus a two-way process: the observer created a space, while the space reinvented its creator in return.",Laura Nenzi,"Annual Meeting of the Association for Asian Studies, Philadelphia",03/20/2014,,,,,"“A Space to Escape, A Space to Engage: Nomura Boto’s Retreat, 1845-1865”"

In the spring of the following year she traveled to Kyoto to denounce the misguided Tokugawa policies before emperor Komei.&#x0D; Much has been made, in twentieth century works, of Tokiko's ""solitary"" mission to Kyoto; she has been hailed for her bravery and determination in embarking on such a mission alone, despite being a woman. Tokiko herself, in the diary of her Kyoto journey, mentions the difficulties she faced for being a solitary traveler. If we look closely behind the scenes, however, we will discover a much more intricate picture than the simplistic (but irresistible) ""woman travels alone"" headline. Tokiko lived and worked at the intersection of several circles and neither her political education nor her journey to the capital occurred in a vacuum. An array of different social and economic networks borne out of her professional life and personal interests facilitated her access to information and provided concrete on-the-ground support before, during, and after the Kyoto mission.",Laura Nenzi,"Symposium Women and Networks in Nineteenth Century Japan,  Sophia University, Tokyo",06/10/2013,,,,,A Loyalist Mission Behind the Scenes: The Many Networks of Kurosawa Tokiko

The many historiographical reincarnations of Tokiko as a ""woman in transit"" reveal various and sometimes contrasting degrees of agency and ability to call the shots – she is alternatively portrayed as a victim of circumstances or hailed as the epitome of a free, independent, untamed spirit that all women (and even some men) should emulate.

Late-Tokugawa Japan was one such times of crisis.

Appeals to cosmic forces took many forms, from the observation of the heavens to the interpretation of dreams or the ""reading"" of perfectly natural phenomena as political omens.&#x0D; In this paper I present the case studies of three women who were witnesses to and involved with the political debate of the bakumatsu.

10245,FT-61504-14,"I presented a global perspective of technology transfer and foreign patenting, using Argentina as a case study from 1866 to 1914. I focus on the technological transfer and patents of farm machinery and tools. My principal research questions are: How effective were imported technologies and techniques once they arrived in a farming region?  Did these foreign technologies lead to new and local patented inventions or innovations? My hypothesis is that the introduction of foreign machinery did not lead to patented domestic inventions and innovations. I examine two practices that might explain the limit to patented new inventions in farm machinery in this agro-exporting country. First, foreign manufacturers took out patents on their machinery imported to Argentina.  Second, foreign companies oftentimes purchased from local farmers the patented modifications specific to their machinery, tools, and techniques.  I created two new data sets on the importation of agricultural machinery and tools to Argentina from 1880* to 1914 and a patent data set of nearly 12,000 patent records from 1866 to 1914 to develop and test my hypothesis.

10260,HB-50225-12,"The Nigerian city of Ìl?rin is renowned for its local, national, and international status as a centuries-old, iconic Muslim city poised between the North and South of Nigeria. However, Ìl?rin is also home to a rich Yorùbá cultural heritage that includes a diversity of practices and beliefs. Ìl?rin's cultural diversity has produced many exciting oral performance styles, such as the popular music style called Fújì characterized by what I call a ""Yorùbá Muslim fusion."" While predominantly Muslim men perform fújì, Muslim women perform several fújì-like, yet distinct, Yorùbá Muslim styles: Bààlúù, S?nw?l?, and Islamic. Since the Quran and hegemonic Islamic institutions oppose the role of women as public performers, Ìl?rin women artists continue to risk being marginalized as insincere and amoral women, Muslims, and citizens. Building on decades of fieldwork with Yorùbá performers and based on recent ethnographic fieldwork with Ìl?rin-based performers, this paper examines artists' life stories and performances in order to piece together a larger narrative about the politics of Yorùbá gender, class, and morality in and beyond Ìl?rin. Drawing upon the work of Barber (2000), Mahmood (2012), Na'Allah (2009), and Omojola (2012), this paper argues that women artists, through their performances, bring together the Yorùbá concept of orí (potential for final self-realization) and the Islamic concept of kádàrá (destiny), thus embodying a Yorùbá Islamic sense of self. By realizing their Yorùbá Islamic selves, these artists remind us how Yorùbá and Islamic sensibilities can enrich and sustain one another.",Debra Klein,Society for Ethnomusicology Annual Conference,11/18/13,,,,,"Destiny: Yorùbá Islamic Performance and Politics of Gender in Ìlorin, Nigeria"

Distinct from the other genres, fújì grew out of Yorùbá Muslim communities and is a popular dance music characterized by its Islamic-influenced vocal style, Yorùbá praise poetry, and driving percussion. While fújì's original ""big men""—charismatic and successful front men credited for shaping the genre—propelled fújì into popularity, lesser-known musicians in the Yorùbá city of Ìl?rin, the ""Mékà of Yorùbáland,"" have been performing fújì since its beginning with a regional emphasis on its Islamic roots. My recent research centers on the fújì community of Ìl?rin, where I have been working with performers of fújì and fújì-related genres since 2010. This paper draws from Martin Shaw (1995), Mahmood (2005), Vargas (2012), and Shipley (2015) to ask how differently situated fújì performers challenge hegemonic discourses of gender, class, and morality that shape local and national politics in Nigeria, such as the Nigerian government's relationship with the terrorist movement, Boko Haram. This work in progress examines recent performances by Lagos-based fújì big man, Malaika, and Ìl?rin-based artist, Alhaja Sheidat Fatimah. Taking inspiration from Martin Shaw's discussion of Kikuyu gender ideology within competing discourses of female power and male dominance, this paper reveals the tensions between gendered discourses of morality and ""big man"" neoliberalism in the shaping of Nigeria's moral and political landscape.",Debra Klein,American Anthropological Association annual conference,11/07/15,,,,,Stop the Violence: Fújì as an Allegory of Nigerianness in the Era of Boko Haram

It sheds light on the politics and economy of prison location in French Senegal. In 1820, the French opened the first prison. However by 1900, prisons mushroomed rapidly and their chosen locations were evident in the toll they exacted on the colony's landscape. Prisons were anchored around early towns, forts, commercial enclaves, trading posts, and colonial towns. By 1960, when Senegal became independent, there were a total of thirty-six prisons.

As more of the nearly 2000 entries are plotted, we anticipate gaining valuable insights into the distribution of items in Boccaccio's geographical inventory. The benefits of plotting the De montibus on a modern map are, we believe, rather obvious. However, certain aspects of this project are somewhat ""betrayed"" by modern cartography. To cite but a single example (and one that is readily apparent in the Fusion sample), the fantastic lake of Nilides mentioned by Juba II and Pliny as the western source of the Nile is, of course, not present in Google Maps. Plotting such geographic features, therefore, requires a certain dose of conjecture. As the project advances, it may well be that the creation of a more ""medieval"" cartographic representation would be more useful, one – for example – that does not take into account the Western Hemisphere, sub-Saharan Africa, Australia or the farther reaches of Asia. In this sense, it would perhaps make more sense to see the De montibus against the backdrop of a vision of the world more comparable to that of Herodotus (if not actually a T-O map).

10453,FT-57973-10,"The paper argues that construction of the myth of ""Partisan Glory"" went through three stages that broadly coincide with late Stalinism, Khrushchevian destalinization, and Brezhnevite stagnation. In the first, the regime's main emphasis was on sifting out all elements of resistance whose behavior under occupation did not fully meet its unrealistic expectations of ideological orthodoxy and fanatical self-abnegation. As a result, what emerged from officially sanctioned accounts was a partisan glory without partisans, so scarce was registry of names of those officially recognized as worthy of this title. In the second, regime displayed interest in rehabilitating some of the previously vilified and repressed ""traitors"", especially former communists, even if their wartime record was uneven at best. The notion of ""restoring good name to honest communists,"" some of whom were pronounced heroes, carried implication of the party rediscovering its true sole. It also tended to lend credence to Khrushchev's claims to rejuvenation of the country. In the third, Brezhnev's leadership endeavored to boost the regime's legitimacy by involving as many people as possible in the celebration of its myths. Consequently, it proved willing to confer the title of ""partisan"" on many a person whose role in the movement was marginal. In each of those phases former resisters, whether real or false, actively participated in shaping and reshaping the public discourse on ""Partisan Glory"" either by denouncing their comrades as ""traitors"" or lending their testimony to party's search for reasons to rehabilitate them, or actively seeking recognition for their friends and acquaintances. Shaping and reshaping the ""Partisan Glory"" was thus a fully social enterprise.

10460,FN-50009-06,"Rivero (1994) makes a distinction between true imperatives (imperatives with unique morphology) and surrogate imperatives (imperatives that make use of the morphology of other moods or features). For negative commands, some languages use true imperative with negation and others use surrogate imperatives. Zejlstra (2004) attempts to capture this phenomenon in an interesting generalization, namely, that only languages in which the negative is X° impose a ban on true negative imperative. This paper reviews this generalization in the light of data from Tanzanian Bantu languages of Kikisi, Kindendeule, Chingoni, and Kimatuumbi, all of which have postverbal negative clitic and use surrogate negative. The particles are ndali (Kikisi), yee (Kindendeule), hee (Chingoni) and lí (Kimatuumbi). The data show that the negative particles exhibit distributional features of adverbs. This paper argues that the post-verbal position of the particle is a result of movement of the verb to a position higher than the adjunction position of the negative. As an adverb, it does not prevent the verb from moving across. This accounts for why in spite of being in post-verbal position, it takes scope over the preceding predicate. The languages in this study do not have a true negative imperative. The verb morphology used for imperative cannot combine with negation to express a negative command. Instead, a negative command is expressed by the prohibitive      –somu (Kikisi), -koto (Kindendeule and Chingoni)  ‘stop' and –kotoka  (Kimatuumbi) ‘do not do' together with an infinitive form of the main verb. Kindendeule also allows an infinitive verb followed by the negative particle yee.

10462,FN-50009-06,"In the Bantu languages of Kikisi (G67), Kiswahili (G42a), Kindendeule (N101) and Chingoni (N12), the subjunctive is a grammatical category that stands in contrast with the indicative mood. Morphologically, the subjunctive is characterized by the verbal suffix –e (or some other variants). Semantically, the subjunctive expresses irrealis and is therefore associated with irrealis-inducing environments such as irrealis-inducing adverbs and complements of manipulative verbs (Givón 1994).&#x0D;  This paper describes the subjunctive in these languages and explores its morphosyntactic characteristics. Drawing on work by Quer (2006) and Stowell (1993), this paper identifies its distribution and its semantic features. It argues that the subjunctive ambiguously exhibits Inflection or Tense features as well as COMP features. With respect to Inflection features, it is in complementary distribution with tense marking. However, it displays COMP features in its selectional relations with the superordinate volitional and directive predicates. This ambiguity is accounted for if we adopt Rizzi's (1997) proposal an of an articulated CP.

These include discourses but also other media—representational apparatuses of all sorts that evoke erotic feeling and shape it as experience and as expression.  Spenser's concern with such technologies surfaces immediately in the proem, as it mirrors (and foreshadows) the Busyrane episode, and later in an allegory that seeks to represent representation along with the damage it can do, as images, objects, creatures, and characters disappear from the narrated action, quite literally absorbed into discourse. Against the pervasive harm of unchaste discourse, Spenser poses on the one hand a utopian fantasy of untrammeled freedom in erotic address, and on the other a visionary quest for the ungesehenmachen (""making-unhappened"") of the amorous discourses dominant in Elizabethan literature, staged as a re-virgination of the culture's erotic imagination. These concerns re-emerge in Amoretti and Epithalamion and carry over into the 1596 installment of The Faerie Queene, where Scudamore appears as a failed counterpart to the poet-speaker of Spenser's sonnet sequence and marriage poem. The Dance of the Graces in canto x of Book VI offers a culminating version of the utopian fantasy of unconstrained erotic celebration, located now in the intimacy of the nuptial relation.",David Lee Miller,,05/15/2014,,,,,"""The Chastity of Allegory"""

Kikisi (G67), a Bantu language spoken in the southern highlands of Tanzania, has not been previously described. Thompson (1988) termed the expressions that modify nouns property concept words. The most well-studied property concept expressions are adjectives. However, adjectives as a lexical category is disputed by some as a universal category. The paper seeks to answer three questions:  (a) How are property concepts expressed in Kikisi? (b) What morphosyntactic properties characterize adjectives? (c) How is gradation and intensification expressed? Following Dixon's (2004) survey findings, Kikisi is identified as a language with a closed adjective class. Other property concepts are nominal in the form of associative structure and possessive form, and verbal property concepts in the form of finite relative and infinitival relatives. Intensification of property concepts is accomplished by the adverb nesu ‘very' or specific ideophones.

The demonstratives are based on spatial relations between the speaker, the addressee, and the object referred to. They may be proximal to the speaker, addressee or neutral. In addition the speaker may use medial or distal distinctions to point or refer to other objects. With respect to form, the demonstratives exhibit agreement with the head of the noun phrase, an agreement that appears in the form of reduplication. The same demonstrative forms appear in pronominal positions, in noun phrases, and as arguments in copula constructions. In addition there is an adverbial demonstrative naha ‘this/that way.'&#x0D; The demonstratives have four different functions: (i) They provide deictic reference by pointing at the object referred to discourse; (ii) the medial demonstrative serves in addition as a marker of definiteness, very much like definite articles; (iii) they may occupy the pronoun positions; (iv) co-reference with antecedents as well as nominal or verbal expressions that appear after the demonstratives.&#x0D; The fact that what Diessel (1999) calls demonstrative pronouns, demonstrative determiner and demonstrative identifiers have the same form gives rise to the question of what is their categorial status. Also consider the fact that Kindendeule does not have 3rd person pronouns. However, demonstratives can function as third person pronouns.

21170,FEL-268372-20,"Medicolegal expertise attracted scrutiny and calls for reform, as its influence in both French courts and culture grew during the nineteenth century. Leading figures in the field were the most vocal proponents of reform. Their critiques crystallized around a number of key issues concerning systemic shortcomings as well as incompetence among some medical experts. While demanding sweeping reform, a number of commentators lamented that deficiencies in medicolegal expertise were responsible for wrongful convictions and for undermining the field of forensic medicine itself.   This paper examines the tensions between confidence and uncertainty in the field of forensic medicine as well as the outcry over insufficiently trained and incompetent practitioners who carried out forensic expertise that exceeded the limits of their knowledge and skills. Serious concerns about medical practitioners' erroneous findings came to the fore in a number of criminal proceedings, including cases of suspected infanticide, poisoning, and suspicious death. Flawed autopsy reports were a lightning rod for criticism. Some doctors demonstrated discomfort or a lack of confidence in distinguishing between various manners and causes of death and carrying out forensic expertise that exceeded the limits of their knowledge or training. For example, a doctor testifying before the assize court of the Seine-Inférieure in 1855 about the inconsistencies in his autopsy reports explained that he had studied forensic medicine only briefly twenty years ago and was ""very ignorant"" about its practices. Nonetheless, forensic doctors advanced a narrative of progress that emphasized the triumph of science and justice, despite the considerable challenges that practitioners of forensic medicine confronted in death investigations during this period.",E.

21175,FT-278632-21,"""From Greek dances on ancient vases, then suddenly to Chopin? How could she have come to this?"" Thus began a 1903 review of Isadora Duncan's new Chopin program by Austrian playwright, critic, and figurehead of the Vienna Secession, Hermann Bahr. This reflection was just one of many as Bahr chronicled Duncan's turn from pictorial to musical inspiration. His reviews of Duncan in the Neues Wiener Tagblatt, along with transcripts of their conversations in his sketchbooks and diaries, richly detail Duncan's early struggle to create of an abstract line in movement that could rival the directness of musical expression. Two private performances in Vienna in Feb., 1902 sparked Bahr's interest in Duncan's endeavor to dance an ""exact, scientific line"" in her pictorial evocations of Greek art. The Chopin program she presented to the Viennese public in March, 1903 thus caught Bahr off guard, causing him to reflect on the impetus for Duncan's new approach. In this presentation, I consider Bahr's attempt to capture the trajectory of Duncan's development from pictorial to musical inspiration and further to explain this development to a Viennese public at once skeptical and fascinated with Duncan's modern experiment. Duncan notoriously moved on from Chopin to Beethoven in Feb., 1904. Yet the initial turn to music as her primary material is still not well understood.

Yet the path for the widely circulated images of her exposed natural body in the German popular press had been prepared by a popular youth artist known as Fidus (1868–1948), whose drawings of chastely dancing nudes illustrated many German youth magazines and by 1903 ""hung in almost every German apartment.""  Also responsible for the frontispiece drawing of Duncan published in her 1903 manifesto, The Dance of the Future, Fidus was an ardent admirer of Duncan's dancing. Many German commentators noted a connection between Fidus and Duncan's visual aesthetics and, more importantly, the political implications for their shared visions of physical health and beauty.  In this presentation, I consider couplings of Fidus and Duncan as like-minded prophets by German critics within the pre-war German body culture (Körperkultur) movement. While in 1903 Duncan had declared herself a Darwinist, she could not have foreseen the program of race regeneration the body culture movement eventually served. Fidus, however, became a zealous National Socialist and eventually dedicated his ""temple art"" to the promotion of Nazi ideology. Drawing on writings by Fidus and proponents of Körperkultur, I present the relationship between Duncan and Fidus as but one in a complex of threads connecting Duncan's choreographic display of the strong, healthy, liberated body to the ideals of race purity and eugenics promoted by many of her German admirers.",Chantal Frankenbach,Dance Studies Association: Galvanizing Dance Studies,10/10/2021,,,,,Isadora Duncan and Fidus:  Images of Race Regeneration in Pre-War Germany

21200,CH-51229-15,"In 2016, the University of Florida (UF) established an international partnership with the Centro de Documentación e Investigación Judío de México (CDIJUM) in order to engage in joint digital projects. CDIJUM was first established as the Centro de Documentación e Investigación de la Comunidad Ashkenazí (CDICA) in 1990 with a mission to rescue, preserve and provide access to the documents, archives, and books that used to be in the building of the Ashkenazi community. The 1985 earthquake in Mexico City compromised the building, and its holdings were scattered across different store houses of the community. Access was restored in 1993, and in 2009, the center's holdings were declared a World Heritage collection by UNESCO. On March 9, 2015, the CDICA expanded its mission to hold and preserve the cultural heritage of all the Jewish communities in Mexico, and it changed its name to reflect this broader vision. The new partnership with the UF Libraries (specifically, the Latin American and Caribbean Collection, the Judaica Library and the Digital Library of the Caribbean) began with the digitization of the complete run of the long-running Spanish-language Jewish newspaper, Kesher. Other scarce Mexican Jewish periodicals were also identified for future iterations of the project. However, the devastating earthquake in Mexico City in 2017 has further highlighted the vital need for such projects. Thankfully, the newspapers had all been taken off site for digitization, but meanwhile the CDIJUM building suffered irreparable damage and their precious archives had to be transferred to temporary storage while a new building is constructed. This paper will describe the above collaborative project and why it is critical to preserve these newspapers and documents.",Margarita Vargas-Betancourt and Rebecca J. W.

21222,RZ-255605-17,"The impetus for the international symposium on which this volume is based stems from ""The Badakhshan Genealogical Project,"" a collaborative project I directed with Daniel Beben and Umed Mamadsherzodshoev with the support of a 3-year National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Collaborative Research Grant. The NEH project was comprised of two parts: the creation of an open access digital repository in the Princeton University Library and a publication of m forthcoming co-authored book with Daniel Beben and Umed Mamadsherzodshoev, titled Ismailism in Badakhshan: A Genealogical History. The goal of the project was to render a corpus of Persian-language (often with Arabic features) genealogical texts, dating from the 15th to the 20th century, legible as historical sources by digitalizing them, identifying their features, defining local genres of genealogy as historical practices, and analyzing them as a source for local, regional, and transregional knowledge of the Isma?ili tradition of Badakhshan and the wider Pamir. Some 65 genealogical texts were located and digitally photographed by me during field research I conducted between 2004-2019 in the towns and villages across the regions of Badakhshan in Tajikistan. This talk will explore how a project I initially conceptualized as one focused on shrine culture evolved into a long-term collaborative project focused on genealogical documentary practice in Afghan and Tajik Badakhshan as a local, archival, familial ""site of knowledge production,"" to use the words of Ann Laura Stoler (2002) and resulted in the construction of an institutional digital archive in Princeton University Library's Digital Repository that preserves these texts as a new public, global, ""site of knowledge production.""

21362,RQ-266203-19,"Bryant identified Redwood as the ""first American novel, strictly speaking."" And he considered the novel an ""hazardous experiment"" because it focused on contemporary society. Twenty-first-century critics have claimed that Redwood is Sedgwick's ""second best novel"" (Fetterley), and possibly the first to challenge slavery twenty-five years before Uncle Tom's Cabin (Karcher). While not an epistolary novel, interpolated letters by multiple characters are vital in forwarding the novel's action and providing the reader with diverse perspectives. This essay argues that Sedgwick's epistolary interludes function as models of the kinds of introspection and questioning that would serve her readers as they navigate their own roles and responsibilities in civic and spiritual life, and they demonstrate the efficacy of letter writing itself as an agent of change. In addition to examining how the cultural work of the novel is advanced through its letters (particularly related to developing religious tolerance and increasing female agency) I will introduces several private, unpublished letters by early readers of the novel that not only shed light on 19th-century responses but also illuminate Sedgwick's historical influences and writing processes.",Lucinda Damon-Bach,,03/04/2021,https://www.societyofearlyamericanists.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SEA 2021  Virtual  Biennial Conference-PROGRAM  final .pdf,See page 24 of conference program,,,“The Cultural Work of Letters in Catharine Sedgwick's Redwood.”

21375,RQ-266203-19,"In her second novel Redwood (1824), Catharine Maria Sedgwick interpolates 24 letters and notes by 15 different characters within the book's 27 chapters. These letters are situated in 8 scenes of letter writing (in which a character is actually writing a letter) and 19 scenes of letter reading. Sedgwick's privileging of these epistolary elements, which include her bookending of the volume with long missives penned by two individuals who are opposites in many ways--Henry Redwood, the eponymous hero, a twice-widowed, wealthy Southerner, and Deborah Lenox, a never-married Vermont farmwoman--demands further consideration. As Caroline Karcher has noted, Sedgwick's narrative experiment in Redwood to ""share authorship with her characters by letting them narrate parts of the story through interpolated letters . . . allows [her] to present multiple perspectives on events and to give voice even to marginal or evil characters"" (10). But in her brief essay aimed at repositioning Sedgwick in American literary history, Karcher did not delve into particulars.  This essay builds on and interrogates Karcher's observation, considering how Sedgwick's epistolary experiments make the novel a bridging text between the completely epistolary novels of the eighteenth century and works published after hers, and examines how her interpolated letters function as models of the kinds of introspection and questioning that could serve her readers as they navigated their own roles and responsibilities in civic and spiritual life. How does Sedgwick use letters to give voice to the voiceless (particularly female characters)? How is the cultural work of the novel advanced through its letters? How might Sedgwick's use of letters demonstrate the efficacy of letter writing itself as an agent of change?

21440,RA-259286-18,"Starting in the year 1870 a new type of public recreation space called ""people's garden"" or millet bahçesi started to take root in the Ottoman Empire's urban centers, from the Balkans to North Africa. These formally landscaped spaces took as their inspiration the Haussmann-era Parisian promenades designed in the ""English style."" Proponents of the recreation movement in Europe advocated for the establishment of public parks to give residents of industrializing cities a respite from pollution and overcrowded slums. Calls for the necessity of new public gardens were concurrently being voiced by Ottoman municipal leaders as well as members of Ottoman civic society. Unlike the sprawling Bois de Boulogne or Bois de Vincennes, however, Istanbul's new parks occupied a much smaller footprint, especially in relation to the city's plentiful meadows or river banks that were already in use as popular sites of recreation. Ottoman government documents, newspaper articles, and personal memoirs provide documentation of the belief that these new public gardens would promote better public health and hygiene. Yet the establishment of these public gardens were less about giving urban residents much needed access to outdoor recreation and fresh air than about serving as symbols of Istanbul's modern urban transformation. This paper looks at textual and visual documentation of some of first public gardens built in key Ottoman cities in 1870, and contrasts them to longstanding Ottoman public recreation spaces and their aesthetic lineage. Studying Ottoman urban renewal in the late nineteenth century raises questions about public access, civic engagement, and the health of growing cities and their publics that are still relevant for urban centers caught in the grip of neoliberal transformation today.",Berin Golonu,"Middle East Studies Association, annual meeting 2021",12/03/2021,https://mesana.org/mymesa/meeting program abs.php?pid=5ba86dac21aeaf233efcb6ec1b8c17eb,conference program,,,Taming the pastoral: Late Ottoman public gardens established in the ‘new style’

This is evident in a diverse state like Florida where nearly one out of four minority residents live below the poverty line, and minority residents are nearly twice as likely to die from chronic diet-related illness than white residents. The Florida Heritage Foods Project at (presenters' home institution) is a student-centered, project-based learning initiative that aims to increase access to fresh and local food for low-income residents by linking local food to local culture. Heritage food lessons in humanities courses guide students toward generating public education materials that 1) provide information on the nutritional and cultural value of specific nutrient-dense crops that are easy and inexpensive to grow in a Florida home garden, and 2) provide quick and easy recipes to promote the consumption of healthier foods. Student-generated artifacts have been adopted by (a local university's) Health Street program, which aims to reduce disparities in healthcare, and by (a local county) K12 Farm-to-School program. By connecting the classroom to public service, instructional artifacts in the Florida Heritage Foods Project empower students to take a proactive role in promoting more sustainable and just food systems in their community.

Together we'll seek to articulate the kinds of knowledge these different approaches offer—one an example of early statistics, and the other more narrative and affective.

She's been frank about seeing real people and hearing their everyday stories, rather than ""all this theory and reading"" and runs a Tuesday evening community update focused on transmission rates and demographics.

The subjunctive ambiguously exhibits Inflection or Tense features as well as COMP features. With respect to Inflection features, it is in complementary distribution with tense marking. However, it displays COMP features in its selectional relations with the superordinate volitional and directive predicates. This ambiguity is accounted for if we adopt Rizzi's (1997) proposal of articulated CP.

I will focus on Temir-Aksakovo deistvo (The Play of Tamerlane), a play written in early 1675 and performed again later that year.  This work will serve as a focal point, from which we can expand to consider the web of communication among many different participants: the playwrights, actors, and audiences in Moscow and their counterparts in the West.

The formal documentation&#x0D; concerning the relatively infrequent embassies sent abroad—instructions to ambassadors and&#x0D; their reports (stateinye spiski) on returning to Moscow—have been mined for what they&#x0D; reveal, but that is only a small part of the evidence that needs to be examined.

The turbulent history of this major Flemish city offers instructive examples of migration – of people and of music: a forced migration of the two abbey communities after Viking invasions to the refugee community of intellectuals in Laon led to defining changes in liturgy and music in Ghent in the tenth to twelfth centuries. In the thirteenth century, migrating clergy brought music for the local saints of Ghent to Prague and Pécs. Finally, between the late fifteenth century and 1559, the monks of St Bavo's abbey were forced to migrate to the church of St John's in Ghent, where they would constitute the chapter at St John's, now renamed and raised in status to the cathedral of St Bavo. This migration forced the monks to adapt to their new environment by renouncing their monastic liturgy and music in favor of the internationally-renowned choral polyphony of the Low Countries, which was accomplished with assistance from leading musicians, including those of Emperor Charles V.

My historical study draws on a vast array of source on and by the people held at the Canton Asylum, as well as oral histories and extensive collaboration with some of their descendants. Conceptualizing asylum life as community history offers a reinterpretation of conventional institutional histories, which privilege administrative perspectives.

10552,FT-59223-11,"The impetus for the rise of ""palatial"" civilization in Crete during the Bronze Age has been a focus of discussion among Aegean and Near Eastern scholars since the first excavations of Knossos at the dawn of the twentieth century.  Arguments for indigenous evolution of the Minoan palaces or exogenous influence from the Near East have oscillated, often in concert with popular theoretical trends in archaeology.  Though much early scholarship on this debate focused on the actual construction of the palaces, in more recent years, many scholars have turned their attention away from the palaces themselves, looking instead for evidence of social ranking in the formative Prepalatial period.  Studies of Prepalatial tombs, seals, pottery, and metals suggest the presence of emergent elites in Prepalatial Crete.  My research on Near Eastern imports to Prepalatial Crete further supports this conclusion.  As many of the imports were used as bodily adornment, they were highly visible and may have played a performative role in Prepalatial society.  &#x0D; &#x0D; In this paper, I analyze the evidence for performance spaces that may have been used by emergent elites in the Prepalatial period to display and reinforce their nascent and perhaps tenuous social power.  Notably, such spaces first appear at the same time as Eastern imports used as bodily adornment, and at the same sites where these imports are concentrated.  This suggests that Near Eastern imports may have played a prominent role in ritual performances in the formative Prepalatial period.",Cynthia Colburn,American Schools of Oriental Research,11/16/2011,,,,,Performance Spaces in Prepalatial Crete

As a result of its dynamic nature, embodied performance can often create and convey meaning more effectively and powerfully than other forms of communication and, therefore, has a more powerful impact on social memory.

This early itinerant history, while well studied in broad strokes, contains one theme just beginning to be explored by scholars: its Jewish connections. In this talk, I focus on the conjoined Jewish-Cabo Verdean diaspora, exploring how this largely unknown yet historically significant dual diaspora is now being re-evaluated among contemporary Cabo Verdeans themselves (both on and off the islands). Parallel to the efforts of many contemporary Portuguese and Brazilians, many Cabo Verdeans are now curious to chart and reclaim the somewhat submerged yet historically critical Jewish component of their island's identity. They are seeking out both their Jewish family history and their peers with Jewish ancestry. This ethnography of Cabo Verdeans with Jewish ancestry will summarize contemporary activities in which many Cabo Verdeans are now engaging in Lisbon, Praia, and New England, where they are reassessing the frequently overlooked Jewish underside to both their family histories and their national identity.

10626,FT-54309-06,"Since its incorporation into the expanding Portuguese empire some 550 years ago, the West African archipelago of Cape Verde has imagined itself as Catholic.  Yet that hegemonic discourse conceals an important subaltern narrative.  Starting with the first years of habitation on these remote islands during the 1460s, Jews arrived in significant numbers.  Their motive?  They fled anti-Semitism first in Portugal and Spain (from the 1492/1496 Edicts of Expulsion and the ensuing Inquisition), and later in Morocco.  The Catholic Church and its legal apparatus immediately suppressed their religion, and they and their descendants married local residents steeped in Catholic as well as local (""animist"") traditions.  Yet in habitus both conscious and unconscious, their descendants embodied many Jewish practices of their ancestors.  These habits and rituals range from dietary and culinary preferences, to life cycle events, to values concerning education and time.  Often taking these mysterious practices as a starting point, many contemporary Cape Verdeans across Europe and the US are (re)discovering the Jewish history of their nation and their individual families.  What does it mean—both at the individual level and at the level of the nation--to refamiliarize oneself with a religious tradition that, until recently, appeared strange, yet was intimately familiar to one's ancestors?

10628,FT-54309-06,"For decades, and in some cases centuries, Cape Verdeans suppressed discussion or even knowledge of their Jewish ancestry, often in order to avoid anti-Semitism.  For a variety of reasons, in recent years many Cape Verdeans (both on and off the islands) have begun exploring their (individual and collective) Jewish heritage and developing a variety of ways to revisit their spiritually mixed identities.  In this talk, I explore these links.  I base my remarks on fieldwork (both formal interviews and informal participant-observation) conducted in Portugal, Cape Verde, and the U.S.  Using this comparative research as a backdrop, I focus on a single ritual event: a Passover Seder held in Boston, and produced jointly for Jewish Americans, and Cape Verdeans with a spectrum of religious backgrounds.  I suggest that this annual occasion (which has just enjoyed its eleventh celebration) highlights the 550+-year-long conversation that Cape Verdeans and Jews have held since the mid-15th century, and that they are now reviving and reconfiguring in the contemporary era.  Drawing at theoretical levels from three decades of prior research on religion in rural, francophone West Africa (among the Beng people of Côte d'Ivoire), I approach the ritual event of the Passover Seder in Boston as an occasion allowing Cape Verdeans to variously reinforce, re-evaluate, and reconfigure their identity through personal interaction, textual reinterpretation, and symbolic performance.  More broadly, combining theoretical perspectives from diaspora studies/hybridity theory on the one hand, and ritual studies/performance theory on the other hand, I argue that the notion of ""African Jewry"" is one whose scholarly time has come.  In the context of contemporary challenges posed by migration, processes of Creolization, and the quest for racial justice, does this new attempt to combat earlier anti-Semitism, which is often embedded in internalized identities, have a space for joining the conversation?",Alma Gottlieb,"2nd Annual Cape Verde Studies Conference, Pedro Pires Institute for Cape Verde Studies (Bridgewater State University), Bridgewater, MA.",06/25/2016,,,,,"Passover, Crioulo Style: Reflections on a Joint Seder"
10636,FB-56944-13,"This paper offers an analysis of Violeta Parra's first solo album, ""Violeta Parra, la voz de los campos chilenos"" (Odeón Chilena, 1955). The record represents the pivotal moment in Parra's life as she left behind a promising and decades-long career as a performer of música popular to pursue her newfound vocation of folklorist. Beyond capturing the musician in her personal moment of transition, the album illustrates key and diverse aspects of the cosmopolitan musical scene of the 1950s. It includes two traditional songs Parra collected as a folklorist, elaborately arranged with Parra on vocals accompanied by a small ensemble of studio musicians. It also features Parra's original composition ""Casamiento de negros,"" which would be picked up and recorded the next year by the U.S. musician and composer Les Baxter, pioneer of the exotica movement of the 1950s and early 1960s. Finally, it includes Parra's hit, ""Que pena siente el alma,"" which would be included on an international demo album for television and radio put out by Capitol Records in 1956. The multi-directionality of Parra's first solo album underscores the ill-defined and transitory cultural moment in which it was produced. It reached ""back"" to the ""root"" music of the Chilean countryside even as it adapted the traditional cantos to modern musical styles. It was the first release in Odeón Chilena's series, ""cantos de Chile"" and thus a nationalist project, yet it provided Parra with her first exposure to an international audience.","Verba, Ericka",XXXIII International Congress of the Latin American Studies Association,05/27/2015,,,,,“The Hybrid Purty and International Nationalism of Violeta Parra’s Folkloric Project”

This dilemma is compounded by other readings shared across branches, and complicated by the survival of chapter headings written to fit one branch in a manuscript of the other branch. None of these problems are new, but they are problems that seem to arise from the fact that the HE and its vernacular counterpart circulated together in Anglo-Saxon England. If it is too circular to say that a palimpsest in Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 10 used the OEHE as a source for itself, it may be safe to say that the OEHE provides one of the clearest surviving examples of a text that was revised and restored (variably) by reference to both itself and its Latin source. I am in the process of editing the OEHE Book III.14-18, and hope to shed new light on the question of the divergence because I have access to materials unknown to Thomas Miller, the last editor of the OEHE.

10759,BH-50600-13,"Jazz is a fascinating study of multiple binary systems: high/low; black/white; popular entertainment/historical artifact. Today, jazz supported with funding and celebrated as an important authentic American art form. Founded in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts did not initially recognize jazz; in 72 years, the Pulitzer Prize for music has only been awarded to one jazz composition (1997). The ""American-ness"" of jazz comes through an amalgamation of folk and roots musics, but became a cultural juggernaut, cutting race, gender, and class, through the recording and film industries, the dance craze, and its core ideologies of hope and rebellion. Following the War of 1812, Americans wanted art forms that would assert our nation's cultural independence; but by the Jazz Age, ""culture"" was associated with upper class refinement and drawing boundaries. Duke Ellington, arguably one of the most important composers of the 20th century, defied musical categorization and transcended boundaries. He wrote the song that names the Swing era, as well as long-form pieces that tell the history of Black people in America. Through his music, Ellington provides a lens by which to examine the spectrums, gradations, multiplicity, and mixture of what we call American culture.",Laura Nash,Humanities Education and Research: Beyond the Binary,4/9/2015,http://www.h-e-r-a.org/Conferences/2015%20San%20Francisco/hera 2015 conference program.htm,,,,"Duke Ellington and American Popular Music: High/Low, Black/White…?"

21498,PD-260978-18,"This paper considers the common assumption that grammatical morphology is likely to preserve more signal of language relationship than is basic vocabulary, and evaluates ways in which the dynamics and mechanisms of language change may make crucial reference to spatially and temporally variable aspects of typological structure and sociolinguistic practice. Through the lens of the Naduhup language family, further informed by a comparative look at three other Amazonian families, I present evidence for processes of morphological change that appear cross-linguistically unusual or extreme. These relate particularly to the rapid generation of new grammatical forms, even while basic vocabulary remains relatively conservative. They also are associated with ‘debonding' processes, flexible behavior of functional elements as between morphology and syntax, and relative promiscuity of grammatical elements' association with different word classes. Many of these phenomena can be linked to areally relevant structural characteristics, particularly the prevalence of verb serialization and noun incorporation, and an emphasis on nominalization as a subordination strategy. Many can also be shown to be grounded in locally salient sociolinguistic practices, most notably relating to zones of intensive, stable multilingualism, in which language contact has had a heavy hand in shaping rates and processes of change.",Patience Epps,University of Oregon Department of Linguistics Colloquium,10/22/21,https://linguistics.uoregon.edu/colloquium-2021-2022,"University of Oregon, Department of Linguistics Colloquium schedule for 2021-2022.",,,Exploring innovation in grammatical morphology: A view from the Amazon

In this paper, I explore the hypothesis that specialized and ritual discourse forms – particularly song, myth, and shamanic incantation – are relevant loci for the development and propagation of linguistic innovations in the Amazon basin, particularly those associated with language contact. This possibility is suggested by a number of observations regarding these discourse forms: their extensive circulation and close replication across speakers, communities, and languages (see e.g. Beier et al. 2002, Epps &amp; Stenzel 2013), their importance within multilingual regional communicative networks, and the social position of the specialists themselves, who tend to bring together both diffuse social networks and relatively high status. Also of note is the tendency for specialized discourse forms to involve alternative lexical and morphological forms, such that the diversity of lects and registers figures in a broader constellation of multilingual interaction – which goes well beyond the languages ‘proper' that are associated with geographic and ethnic distinctions (Epps forthcoming). I consider several examples of grammatical and lexical change in languages of the northwest Amazon that have plausible ties to specialist discourse.",Patience Epps,"Workshop ‘Towards a holistic understanding of language contact in the past’, Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea",09/03/2021,http://sle2021.eu/programme,Website for the conference program,,,"Specialized discourse, language contact, and language change: Observations from Amazonia"

It is often a long-term developmental process, requires recursive planning and assessment, and often engages multiple communities. We present a case study of a research project that grew into a community and collaborative archaeological endeavor that balances engagement between two descendant communities of opposing sides of St. Clair's Defeat, and the Northwest Indian War. Bridging the cultural gap between these two communities while maintaining commitment to accurate retelling of historical narrative presents many challenges. However, these challenges present direct opportunities to use anthropology in the public sphere to foster empathy and understanding through historical archaeological context. We engage with the popular, but uncritically one-sided, narrative represented in historical public interpretation and even school curricula. We confront this narrative with the full context of the historical and archaeological record. This confrontation facilitates frank, educational discussions about the innate humanity of the other side, leading to reflections about assumptions and a critical assessment of identity and self-history. These reflections enable engagement of both communities with the history and consequences of colonization for American Indians formerly of the Northwest Territory and beyond.","Christine Thompson, Kevin C.

Terry argued that the architectural modifications made by the Lutheran Reformers in the 16th century directly affected Bach's compositional palette by reducing the reverberation time and allowing more polyphonic and temporal variation in the liturgical works composed for the space. Here the history of the building and its renovations are presented, as well as acoustical measurements in the current church, which has been renovated since Bagenal's time to more accurately match the interior as it existed in Bach's time. Some comments are provided Bagenal's theory as well as the effect of the material and geometric changes made by the Reformers on the performance of Bach's music during his lifetime.","Braxton Boren, Jackson Anthony",International Congress on Acoustics (ICA2019),09/09/2019,https://pub.dega-akustik.de/ICA2019/data/articles/001268.pdf,,,,Acoustical and architectural history of the Thomaskirche in Leipzig

21616,RZ-260848-18,"The Bouleuterion (Council House) at Notion is one of a number of similar structures in western Asia Minor of comparable plan, size, and location; their identification as Bouleuteria is based largely on the latter two characteristics; they enclose large auditoria, capable of holding significant numbers of people, and they are situated on or near public squares.  The history of this building type is conventionally traced back to the Old and New Bouleuteria of Athens, dated to the late 6th and late 5th centuries respectively, but all the comparable buildings in Asia Minor are considerably later; the earliest securely dated example is the Bouleuterion at Miletus, constructed according to the dedicatory inscription to Antiochus IV between 175 and 164 BC. Thus while the Athenian Bouleuteria may indeed have served as precedents, and the New Bouleuterion at Athens was in fact also renovated in the 2nd c. BC, the building type exemplified by the Bouleuterion at Notion was essentially a Hellenistic creation.  The Bouleuterion at Notion was partially excavated by Mustafa Büyükkolanci in the 1994, and has recently been cleaned and documented. Rectangular both in external outline and in its internal seating arrangement, it is larger in plan (24.2 X 30.5 m) than any other comparable building – considerably larger than the Bouleuteria of Priene and Heracleia, for example, and larger also than both the Old and the New Bouleuteria at Athens. It can be reconstructed in detail both in plan and in section, thanks to its remarkably transparent design; the whole building is based on a unit of 16 Attic/Ionic feet. In its design, construction, and urban setting, the Bouleuterion at Notion adds new detail both to the history of the local community and to the development of one of the preeminent civic building types of Hellenistic architecture.",Christopher Ratté,,01/08/2022,,,,,The Bouleuterion at Notion
21714,PR-276851-21,"Creating ""oneness"" through communication structures and research means creating inclusive and accessible communication research. Mobile technologies in recent years have been at the forefront of making more-accessible communication and media, with dozens of mobile-first accessibility features emerging. These technologies also have inspired many profound reconsiderations of space and place that increase accessibility. Therefore, the Mobile Communication Interest Group is uniquely positioned at ICA to support more media-accessibility studies but also, in particular, to support novel research approaches to accessible place-based media. Such studies radically could transform otherwise inhospitable terrain for people with disabilities, such as blindness, into comfortable and coherent common ground. In that regard, people who are blind advocate for more and better Audio Description – the remediation of visual media into audible media – like people who are deaf advocate for high-quality Captioning and Sign Language Interpretation. While Audio Description is primarily created for the benefit of people who are blind or people who have low-vision, it also can be helpful for people who are print dyslexic or even people who just want to learn more through their ears. In other words, more inclusive media is simply better media for more people. This study originated in a hackathon-like workshop, called a Descriptathon, in which more than 100 people from across North America (the U.S. and Canada) were brought together, gathered into teams, and trained over three days how to create Audio Description with the end goal of the intensive workshop to leave with an audio-described version of their place's print brochure.

21715,PR-276851-21,"This paper is aimed at identifying core values of Audio Description that affected feelings of Social Inclusion. To identify these values, the authors hosted a hackathon-like ""Descriptathon"" that brought together more than 100 people from throughout the United States and Canada in a three-day intensive workshop designed to audio describe print brochures of communally important public places (16 national parks), with those descriptions being evaluated by blind or low-vision people using validated scales measuring aspects of Social Inclusion (Jason et al., 2015; McColl et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2008). Within that judging feedback, the authors also conducted a content analysis of the 122 qualitative responses received. An independent coder and one of the co-authors established a sufficient inter-rater reliability (78.6%, Cohen's Kappa= 0.71) over three passes through the data, which began with a list of 17 identifiable social-inclusion values that eventually were parsed to 5 broader labels, plus an ""other"" value for outliers. Those social-inclusion values in the description feedback were ultimately labeled as ""Detailed,"" with description answering all of the questions of the listener, ""Organized,"" when description seemed created with a clear structure, ""Objective,"" when description was delivered from a neutral perspective, ""Concise,"" when description avoided extraneous details, and ""High Quality,"" when description was created with a polish and flair that the judges appreciated. By identifying and operationalizing those core values in this study – as compositional techniques for potentially increasing feelings of social inclusion and improving public health through more-inclusive public discourse – we then were able to test those values in practice in a second Descriptathon, offered in October 2021, which also included participants in the United Kingdom.

21716,PR-276851-21,"With a Grounded Theory approach, we have been analyzing texts to try to determine ways in which this type of description can be effective, to develop best practices for the field. In very quick summary of that process, we first read each description to determine its distinct thought units (which can be a word or a phrase). Then we categorize those units into themes, such as Age, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, etc. And then we go back into those higher-order categories, such as Gender, and really dig into them. Gender identity is constructed through 4 primary approaches in portrait Audio Description: •Use of a gendered name, such as John or Jennifer •Use of a gendered noun, such as man, woman, daughter, etc. •Use of a gendered pronoun, such as he, she, his, hers •And, use of descriptive words (adjectives, like bearded, female, etc.) or descriptive phrases (like wearing a dress, or carrying a purse)  And by determining those gender-construction methods, we can evaluate a description by how it uses such conventions, or not.  Gender is a good example of an area of contemporary discourse under negotiation, where some people are choosing gender-neutral pronouns, such as they, as a rhetorical act of protest against gender designations. Where this all will go, I have no idea. It's really beyond the scope of our project to try to shape or determine evolving discourse strategies.

21718,PR-276851-21,"Audio Description typically involves a sighted intermediary, who translates visual media into acoustic media, as neither the creator of the source material nor its intended recipient. This person audibilizes what can be seen in the source material, but the quality of that audibilization depends greatly on the skills, training, style, motivation, and engagement of the describer. This remediation process usually is conducted for the explicit benefit of people who are blind or low-vision. The image and the audible description often then are divorced, to create segregated experiences, involuntarily splitting people apart by how well they can see. In this process, one group of people typically learns about the source content from sight and the other from sound. Yet those acoustic representations – in terms of overall fidelity – are rarely equivalent in merit to the source material, so scholars and practitioners, especially in the past decade, actively have been refining industry best practices and academic insights in order to improve Audio Description qualities. A primary area of such scholarly focus is the quality of Audio Description products as artifacts of discourse.To address that topic, this study's author gathered more than 100 self-descriptions during two separate Audio Description-oriented workshops, about six months apart.

As the number of English and other Humanities majors has decreased over the last decade, the English Department at Doane University designed the Integrated Humanities program to attract students to our classes and emphasize our role in students' long-term career successes.   This session provides an overview of the Certificate in Integrated Humanities Program, which offers students a humanities-centered pathway through their general education requirements with an attention to their professional goals. In a pathway, students study a contemporary, complex issue, such as opioids and addiction or the politics of fear, from multiple disciplinary perspectives and engage in interdisciplinary, independent research to earn a Certificate. What makes this program particularly unique is that each pathway is rooted in experiential learning and intentional collaboration among faculty to make explicit to students the value of a strong liberal arts foundation. The coursework is also connected to co-curricular programming and community events that bring experts and practitioners from the region to share their experiences and perspectives with students.

21841,AKB-270210-20,"More and more students enroll in college with a career or a professional goal in mind. Given that mindset, students are often frustrated by their general education requirements; the relevance of the broad foundation of general education to a specific career or major is not obvious to them. And yet, the broad foundation general education courses offer are integral to develop the range of skills needed in most careers. The aim to enhance students' general education learning and help them connect that foundation to their major programs of study is one shared by many faculty and administrators.  In 2020, Doane University launched the Certificate in Integrated Humanities, which connects students' career goals with a strong liberal arts foundation. The Certificate in Integrated Humanities establishes pathways through the Doane Core, the general education program, where students study an contemporary interdisciplinary issue, such as Opioids and Addiction, from multiple disciplinary perspectives. The program bundles existing courses with these new concept-based courses to make transparent the connections for students.  This interactive seminar will draw upon Doane University's successful launch of the Integrated Humanities program and utilize small group activities, individual brainstorming, and larger group discussion to help attendees think creatively about ways their institutions and departments might innovate their general education program. The activities will highlight potential obstacles and ways around them; practical steps to consider; and adaptability and scalability for these innovations.

From data visualization to a collaborative online exhibit, The SYRIOS Project demonstrates how digital humanities enhance the value of coins as historical evidence.    Phase One of the project critically reassesses the city of Antioch by applying the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis and digital mapping to a database of 300,000 coin finds. Although Antioch's prominence is famous, a quantitative analysis of coins minted in the city and excavated throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East exposes the gradations of imperial power and local agency mediated within its walls. Patterns in coin distribution serve as a significant index of spatial politics and the policies of the different authorities making use of the city. Evaluating the coins against other historical material reveals that Antioch's status was not fixed, nor the people passive pawns for external powers. Instead, as imperial governments capitalized upon Antioch's location and amenities, the citizens developed in their own distinct identities and agency – both financial and political. Antioch of the Antiochians must therefore be elevated from traditional narratives and static characterizations, being studied and celebrated for the dynamic polis it was. The results of Phase One will be published as a monograph with Cambridge University Press in Summer 2021.    Phase Two of the project aims to bring this scholarly research to a public audience through a dynamic online exhibit. Funded by the NEH, our collaborative team from the humanities and technology studies is currently developing a prototype focused on the coins and people of Antioch.

21922,FN-271117-20,"Small-scale multilingualism has been described as intrinsically different from more well-known polyglossic forms of multilingualism in contemporary urban/globalized societies.  In this talk, we take a closer look at one of the better-known cases of small-scale multilingualism: the Vaupés region of northwest Amazonia. In this highly multilingual society, individuals are commonly proficient in multiple indigenous and colonial (now national) languages.  Longstanding norms of exogamous marriages, political equilibrium among groups, and language ideology have traditionally supported this individual polylingualism and societal multilingualism. Local ideologies promote one's father's language as the primary marker of social identity and ostensibly mandate loyalty to this patrilect. Indeed, some ethnographic accounts argue that such patrilect-based essentialist ideologies are key in shaping some observed linguistic practices, including avoidance of lexical borrowing and restrained displays of multilingual prowess. Nevertheless, little is known about the actual use of multiple languages in everyday interaction, a gap our work seeks to address. We draw on a large corpus of video recordings of informal, everyday interaction collected from 2017-2019, focusing on cases of code-switching and accommodation, long presumed to be either unattested or highly dispreferred. We present evidence for a wider range of multilingual practices in the Vaupés than previously claimed, demonstrating the everyday accomplishment of multilingualism in social interaction. Our analysis and findings call into question the bifurcation of multilingualism into ‘small-scale' and ‘modern'(?)/'non-small-scale'(?) types. Instead, we argue for the development of a typology of multilingualisms based on empirical analysis of actual multilingual practices in everyday life.","Kristine Stenzel, Nicholas Williams","Sociolinguistics Symposium 23, Session “Unsettling multilingualism: insights from non-polyglossic communities around the globe”",6/7/2021,,,,,Toward an interactional approach to multilingualism: insights from the Vaupés

Our talk and recent work analyzes data from a large corpus of video recordings of sociolinguistic interviews and spontaneous interaction collected in Kotiria and Wa'ikhana communities between 2017-2020. Our findings illustrate the need to distinguish explicit ideologies, observable in ""people's opinions about the languages around them"", from implicit ideologies, ""covert systems of beliefs"" revealed in actual language use  and how these may compete within speakers in different contexts. Excerpts from interviews and informal everyday interactions demonstrate both speaker perspectives on ""being multilingual"" (often orienting to explicit ideological norms) and their actual behavior ""doing multilingualism"" through a range of attested and common practices — from monolingual exchanges to cases of code-switching and accommodation — long presumed rare or highly dispreferred.

22017,HAA-263850-19,"The development of virtual unwrapping, which is based on the software analysis of volumetric images of damaged and unopened materials, has led to novel discoveries such as one of the oldest copies of Leviticus, written in Hebrew. Few are aware that the early development of virtual unwrapping was inspired by book bindings - in partial states of damage - containing text cannabilized from earlier manuscripts. In this paper we discuss those initial successful experiments, which revealed a new reverse side (hidden) text from Ecclesiastes, written in Hebrew. We then frame what we think is a very promising set of future opportunities using virtual unwrapping for bindings and covers that are damaged and/or require analysis in situ, in the context of the advances we have made in technologies for scanning (x-ray tomography) and analysis (machine learning and artificial intelligence).",W.

10771,AQ-50660-12,"We proposed and had approved a session entitled ""Teaching Memory Studies""&#x0D; Excerpt from our session proposal:&#x0D; ""Negotiating Sites of Memory,"" the presidential theme for the 2015 MLA convention together with the approval of an MLA Memory Studies forum in 2014 attest to an increasingly widespread application of the discipline of memory studies to the areas of scholarly endeavor the MLA supports, including the teaching of literature and writing. Previous MLA sessions related to teaching memory studies include ""Teaching Life Writing Now"" (presiding, Cassuto, 2011), and ""Reading Memory: Approaches to Teaching the Memoir"" (presiding, Donohue, 2015). Our panel will contribute to this growing conversation while also pushing the boundaries of memory studies pedagogy in literature courses beyond its close affiliation with memoir and literary criticism to attend to the cultural processes by which memories are shared. In the past several decades ""cultural memory"" has developed as a term to describe the ways societies remember their past using a variety of media (Astrid Erll and Ann Rigney). In this context, virtually any object of literary and cultural studies is a work of remembering, even as it at once evokes and takes root in readers' and viewers own memories, a process that takes place on the collective as well as personal level. Together our papers demonstrate that by bringing the interdisciplinary tools of memory studies into the classroom, we are able to create an ""official"" disciplinarily structured space for exploring the contents and operations of memory both in an object of study and at the interface of object and viewer/readers, thus opening an awareness of memory as a life practice that is fluid, creative, and shared.",Martha Rust and Suzanne England,Modern Language Association Annual Convention,1/5/17,,,,,Conference Session
10790,RQ-50570-11,"What happens when a new interpretive framework passes into the hands of a practitioner of applied basic research? Thomas Edison, perhaps the most accomplished technological thinker in the U.S., was such a person in 1885 when he took up the implications of electromagnetic field theory. Edison's recent work on wireless telegraphy coincided with papers by British mathematician and engineer Oliver Heaviside, who, like Edison, was a former telegrapher and a capable experimentalist. The start of Edison's effort is marked by several pages of undated and previously overlooked tables outlining reciprocal relationships between electrical and magnetic energy and the passage of energy through corresponding devices such as electromagnets and condensers. In these pages he began to formulate an applied research program into the&#x0D; convertibility of energy and its propagation through space. Edison hoped to generate new knowledge that might have practical applications. He also sought to identify a new form of energy. He had for years believed in the possible existence of such energy, provisionally named ""XYZ,"" and now prepared to look systematically for ""a new radiant force, lying somewhere between light and heat on one hand and magnetism and electricity on the other."" Edison's inquiry took him not to&#x0D; Maxwell but back to Faraday's Experimental Researches, from which he adapted ideas and experiments. Adopting Faraday's outlook and methods, Edison pursued XYZ and related questions, hoping to make a fundamental discovery of practical importance.","Paul Israel, Louis Carlat",History of Science Society Annual Conference,11/22/2013,http://hssonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Abstracts.pdf,Link to Session Abstracts for 2013 HSS Meeting,,,A New Radiant Force’: Thomas Edison’s Inquiry into the Implications of Electromagnetic Field Theory

By argument and example I demonstrate not only what such rhetoric says but also how it works--that is, how it resonates and even energizes certain experiences of powerlessness among Muslims (and among Muslim men in particular) situated in very different contexts who may share very little with one another--and very little with radical Islamists in addition.

10813,RQ-50364-09,"When we think about places of invention we tend to think of those places where an inventor did his or her most important work or mature work.  In the case of Thomas Edison this is usually his Menlo Park Laboratory and secondarily his later laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey.  However, these laboratories were not isolated places.  Instead they were part of larger networks of places that contributed in a variety of ways to the inventive activity at the labs.  Furthermore, the creation of these laboratories drew on and embodied aspects of earlier places in Edison's career.  In order to understand the inventive work that took place in these laboratories we need to examine their relationship to these other places.  At the same time, by looking at the range of inventive places in which Edison worked during his career we can also gain deeper insight into how particular places contributed to specific types of inventive work.  In this paper I will focus on the ways in which Edison's early experiences helped to shape his more his more famous laboratories and his inventive practices.",Paul Israel,Society for the History of Technology Annual Meeting,10/17/2009,,,,,Thomas Edison’s Places of Invention

Mace (1941-1998), an outstanding leader who turned his personal challenge of extensive incapacitation from polio as a child into the achievement of becoming the recognized leader of the Universal Design movement by the early 1990s (it was Mace who coined the term ""Universal Design).&#x0D; &#x0D; This first phase of exploration was largely about the removal of physical barriers to access, and culminated in the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.

10835,FX-50055-08,"Following the Edict of Expulsion of 1290, Jews and Judaism continued to be targeted by English poets, preachers, and chroniclers via retellings of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD by Roman forces. These narratives anachronistically imagined the destruction of Jerusalem as retribution for the Crucifixion, when in fact the siege occurred centuries before the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity. Examples of such works include the alliterative Siege of Jerusalem, chronicle histories of John of Tynemouth and Ranulf Higden, and theatrical versions performed as late as 1622, when a play entitled Titus and Vespatian was recorded at the court of James I.&#x0D; &#x0D; The goal of this paper is twofold. I will first demonstrate how a single 15th-century manuscript, Cleveland Public Library MS W q091.92-C468, interweaves the history of Jerusalem with the history of England itself. The manuscript opens with a brief geographical text surveying Biblical lands and begins ""Iosephus of Iewis the noble was the first auctour of the book of policronica."" This is followed by an abridged version of the prose Brut, a comprehensive history of England, and the brief poem Cur mundus militat. The manuscript closes with the sole surviving Middle English prose translation of Roger D'Argenteuil's Bible en François, which details the fall of Jerusalem. As such, English history is bracketed by Josephan history, and the reader is invited to understand it through this lens.&#x0D; &#x0D; My second goal is to show that this positioning of texts is emblematic of the significant place that Jerusalem occupied in late medieval English memory. I will pay particular attention to 1) the role that ‘curated memory' played in the sacrament of confession and in medieval sermons, which often urged a mindfulness of past transgressions, and 2) the purpose of narratives featuring ‘successful' conquests of Jerusalem in an era of failed crusades to recapture the city.",Timothy L.

The photograph was by far the most famous image that emerged from La Croisière Noire (The Black Crossing), an expedition across the Sahara sponsored by Citroën.  The photograph circulated in a diverse array of media throughout the 1920s and 1930s: books, postcards, posters, sculpture, and most curiously, fashion. In books, the photograph was used as evidence of what many European explorers had identified as the Mangbetu people's advanced and hierarchical society.[i]  The dignified and elegant profile of a woman whose skull had been carefully shaped by binding when she was a child was emblematic of the aesthetics of the Mangbetu, which were often linked to ancient Egypt.[ii]   The image was adopted in hat designs in the 1920s and 1930s, and continues to have currency in fashion, appearing most recently in photographs made by designer Thierry Mugler in 1988 and John Galliano in 2008.

10871,EH-50424-14,"In the court of public opinion, the ceramic tiki mug is likely to elicit a range of reactions based on the time period in question. A 1940s Los Angeleno might associate the material object with memories of a wild night at the popular Don the Beachcomber establishment, filled with ‘exotic' sights, sounds, and libations. A citizen of the 1980s might associate the mug with tackiness and tastelessness, or worse yet, might not be able to make any association with the mug at all, owing to tiki's fall from popularity. But today, the seasoned craft bartender (also known as a ‘mixologist') will likely see the mug as an opportunity to craft a historic tiki cocktail or an updated remix. The last two decades have seen a spate of new tiki bars open across the United States whose focus is less on kitsch and more on craft, the complicated exotic cocktails and their elaborate vessels serving as demonstrations of one's virtuosity and knowledge. This project contends that the contemporary tiki revival of the last two decades, which encompasses not only bars and glassware but an entire lifestyle of conventions, clothing, sculpture, and music, owes its popularity to the combination of both the localized, grassroots circulation of information and mass media's glamorized portrayals of historical drinking culture. This chapter explores material and cultural aspects of the tiki revival, considering the role of media ranging from early internet forums, self-published zines, and small-print books to widely available mass market television shows, films, and magazines. Furthermore, the chapter argues that the rhetoric surrounding contemporary tiki culture, which is distinctly American, displays a selective reclamation of values, eschewing the culture's historical roots in orientalism in favor of a quasi-anthropological unearthing of historical tiki knowledge, an appraisal of its geographical inaccuracies, and an indulgence in temporal nostalgia.",Anya Kurennaya,Mid-Atlantic Popular and American Culture Association Conference (Atlantic City),11/4/2016,https://mapaca.net/conference,MAPACA Conference Homepage,,,From Zombies to Zines: A Cultural and Material History of the Contemporary Tiki Revival
10872,EH-50424-14,"When Beyonce took the stage or, rather, the football field, at the 2016 Super Bowl Halftime Show, she employed potent stylistic references along with music and dance to present a narrative laden with alternate meaning and political subtext. Her bandolier jacket referenced a similar jacket worn by Michael Jackson during his 1993 Super Bowl performance, while her dancers were styled in costumes visually reminiscent of 1960s Black Panther dress. Beyonce's performance employs historical images to speak to present concerns while simultaneously highlighting and visually recontexualizing historical milestones, creating a historical trajectory which connects the past and present to speak to future possibilities for addressing race in America. This paper explores occurrences such as these as an effective tool for examining and re-examining fashion history, arguing that popular culture plays an important role in presenting and representing historical images. Furthermore, such referential occurrences create historical links that can, oftentimes, reinterpret the past in a way that archival images and documents alone cannot. The visual and symbolic links created between the past and the present are useful tools for students examining fashion history since they speak to multiple time periods at once, challenge canonical representations of history, and offer multiple interpretations.

10875,EH-50424-14,"Hair, as a particularly malleable component of our embodied selves, is a tool that can help symbolize our identity. Subject as it is to a variety of fashion trends and cycles, it can be taken as indicative of individual as well as collective shifts in identity construction. The spate of celebrities who have adopted ‘unnatural' hair colors in recent years, from cotton-candy pink to aqua blue, reflects at once a seismic shift in techniques of self-fashioning and a continuation of historical beauty practices meant to embody the particular beauty ideal of the time. This paper traces the history and contemporary use of 'unnatural' hair dyes (pink, purple, blue, etc.) and the different reasons women have had for dyeing their hair these 'unnatural' shades. Contemporary celebrities like Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj engage with beauty culture as a status symbol and individualizing technique drawn from earlier subcultural dress practices, while caricatured ‘granny' rinsers Betty Slocombe and Dame Edna Everage serve as a satire of older women's seemingly frivolous and clumsy engagement with fashion and beauty culture.

From posting passive-aggressive comic strips on panel walls to using the semi-privacy of the cubicle to engage in acts of non-work, anti-work, or even direct sabotage, the cubicle also creates opportunities for resistance. Drawing on Michele de Certeau's concept of ""poaching"" or ""la perruque,"" this paper will explore the cubicle as a site of transgressive workplace behavior and consider how the very walls that serve as an expression of organizational control also offer workers space to challenge that authority through acts of resistance.

10887,EH-50424-14,"Starting in the 1970s, computers and other types of VDTs (visual display terminals) became common fixtures in American offices. These new devices changed the structure and content of a number of clerical and white-collar jobs, and according to ergonomic research of the time, created new forms of physical, emotional, and psychological stress for workers. While some of the physical issues associated with computer usage were sources of temporary discomfort for workers, others could lead to long lasting or even permanent injuries and disabilities. Although the computer was recognized as the source of the problem, its design and use was largely unchallenged. Instead, recommendations to address these known issues focused on the provision of specialized ergonomic furniture along with environmental and behavioral changes that could ameliorate some of the problems. While the technology was increasingly fixed and standardized in its basic design, ergonomic furniture had to be optimally flexible to accommodate diverse bodies and uses.

The project was conceived by Lilla Kopár of The Catholic University of America (CUA) and I, in collaboration with Worthy Martin and Daniel Pitti of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia, who are coordinating the technical specifications of the project. In 2013, we convened an international workshop for humanities scholars, museum professionals, and technology experts from Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to refine the conceptual design of the proposed research tool and identify its technological requirements in preparation for a pilot project. We initiated partnerships with The British Museum and the National Heritage Board of Sweden to aggregate data from their digital collections. In 2014, we held a small workshop of content specialists in medieval art and archaeology, library and information science specialists, and technology experts to lay the foundations of a project-specific thesaurus of iconographical subjects for the Andvari portal. Our next step is to create a working pilot portal that will allow semantic searching.

However, he stopped short of awarding their way of life a precise canonical status.  While this bull has been seen as a critical part of the establishment of Francesca Romana's community, its role in the papacy's centuries long efforts to corral, contain, and control the great variety of religious vocations taken up by secular Roman women has not been considered.

These students enter the workforce and civic society ill-equipped especially in a time of climate change, persistent inequalities, and pandemic. Even so, our institution, like many others, is facing a financial crisis where the humanities have felt the most immediate impact. How then can we meet this need in a time of scarce resources? A mathematician and a writer have joined forces to create a cross-disciplinary, embedded curriculum that is both cost effective and impactful.  During our interactive panel, we will present our National Endowment for the Humanities funded model. Instead of adding credits to our general education core, our department is in the process of binding our disciplines together through embedding ethics education into our core courses: writing, communications, and math. By doing so, we will unify our curriculum, increase our students' ethical reasoning, and create a way to better assess our general education program through eportfolios. We will present an adaptive framework that addresses two fundamental questions: What is an embedded curriculum? How can it be achieved? After briefly situating our institution and our unique goals, we will define what an embedded curriculum is including reasons for its effectiveness and how it differs from a theme-based model. From there, we will describe our process to embed ethics education by engaging the audience through a series of reflective questions within four identifiable challenge categories: faculty insecurities, discipline specific issues, assessment, and institutional challenges.  These challenge categories will help audience members consider their own unique challenges as well as provide us a framework to discuss our own creative solution rooted in a community of practice.

22091,AE-269233-20,"Proposal abstract: Many English departments continue to face a decline in student enrollment, institutional funding, and public support. Hence, there has been a push to reimagine the English major. However, any significant curricular revision is time intensive, costly, and fraught with systemic red tape. Furthermore, adding a new set of courses or a new degree track often is dependent on expertise and faculty lines. At Montana State University Billings, we've had a near 50% decline in English majors in recent years (2014-2019) and a similar decrease in tenure/tenure-track lines within our English, Philosophy, and Modern Languages department with no guarantee of adding any new lines. Yet, the need for critical thinking, cultural criticism, and ethical reasoning is at an all-time high considering the pandemic, global warming, and persistent inequalities. How then can we meet this need in a time of scarce resources? I propose an alternative approach by embedding cross-disciplinary outcomes into the English major curriculum. In the last two years, a colleague and I have created a National Endowment for the Humanities funded cross-curricular model initially focused on embedding ethics education into three core general education courses--writing, communication, and math--as a way of unifying our disciplines, increasing our students' ethical reasoning, and creating a better way to assess our general education program through ePortfolios. However, this adaptive framework does not need to be limited to general education. In fact, it could allow English departments greater curricular flexibility while increasing student learning. Faculty can embed a cross-disciplinary outcome within a series of existing courses (i.e., ethics within a series of writing courses, digital humanities within a series of literature courses, or a combination of both) often at the department level without going through the university or system curriculum process.

22102,FEL-273163-21,"James Laidlaw's 1982 article on Christine de Pizan's gifts of her poetry to the Earl of Salisbury and Henry IV of England first asserted that the Epistre Othea in British Library Harley Manuscript 219 was dedicated to Henry, not Charles VI of France. My own recent investigation of Harley 219 is indebted to Laidlaw's work and complements his conclusion from a paleographical angle:  Harley 219 was copied by Thomas Hoccleve, clerk of the Royal Office of the Privy Seal. Hoccleve translated Christine's Epistre au dieu d'Amours into The Letter of Cupid in 1402, likely gaining access through the manuscripts Henry confiscated from Salisbury (Laidlaw 1982). Laidlaw's theory that Christine's work was transmitted from Henry through Hoccleve explains how the sole witness of the royal dedication survives in a rather lackluster manuscript. In this presentation, I reexamine Christine's influence on Hoccleve, arguing that she – through the Epistre au dieu d'Amours, Epistre Othea, and the figure of authorship that she represented – was a chief figure to whom Hoccleve responds throughout his career, from his first effort in Cupid to his last compositions in the Series (1420s). Hoccleve repeatedly presents himself as following in the footsteps of ""father Chaucer,"" but I argue that he owes a much greater debt to Christine than has been acknowledged by scholars thus far.",Misty Schieberle,"57th International Medieval Congress (Kalamazoo, MI)",05/13/2022,,,,,"Christine de Pizan’s Influence in England: Thomas Hoccleve, Harley 219, and Beyond"

The second half offers examples of manuscripts that show that the Letter was transmitted with a range of poems that seem designed to engage gender debates. These include both Hoccleve's own autograph/holograph manuscripts and scribal collections that may include misogynist poems by Lydgate and poems sympathetic to women by Chaucer. My presentation underscores how Hoccleve provocatively turns Christine's pro-woman poem into an ambiguous declaration by Cupid and that even medieval contemporaries were divided on whether Hoccleve's poem should be categorized among pro-woman or antifeminist works.",Misty Schieberle,"57th International Medieval Congress (Kalamazoo, MI)",05/12/2022,,,,,The May Poems of Thomas Hoccleve: Gender and the Letter of Cupid

Before scarcity and synthetic materials supplanted them, natural components sourced from the animal kingdom were plentiful in the decorative arts. These objects, created from hard matrices and collagen-based organics by artists whose craft traditions are scarcely practiced today, are culturally, historically, and artistically important. This project focuses on cataloguing a group of objects with a high standard of accuracy, acquiring information through visual and scientific analysis, research, and expert consultation. The work is a collaboration between curatorial, conservation, and scientific staff to understand findings within the craft context for each object.  The project's main objective is to make the animal organics more accessible through accurate and full catalogue records including creation context, photography, condition information, materials identification, and web descriptions.

Amanda Villepastour has updated Du Bois's analogy to the telegraph, referring to the Yorùbá practice of Batá drumming as ""ancient text messages"" (2010). Despite nearly a century of academic study, the full nuance of speech-to-music mappings is only recently becoming known through computational analysis, such as Seifart's study of Amazonian Bora drumming. Seifart revealed minute variations in speech rhythm were preserved in slit drum interpretations (et al. 2018).

We follow the practices of two social networks (Milroy and Llamas, 2013) of Puerto Ricans and qualitatively detail how different technological platforms are shaping the way youth orient to themselves through ideological language constructs (Spanish, English) and more nuanced aspects of their repertoire (textspeak registers, non-binary language, symbols). In this sense, we portray a Puerto Rican bilingual who draws on a diverse range of semiotic practices, challenging previous notions of Puerto Ricans as adhering to Spanish-dominant practices alone. Therefore, we project an image of an island bilingual that is multimodal and literate in different Englishes, Spanishes and in-between contact styles. Data are gathered from popular social media applications (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) as well as text-messaging applications (WhatsApp, iMessage), for a total of 500 screenshots. By incorporating a multimodal perspective (Bezemer and Kress, 2015) to interpreting bilingual speech, the Puerto Rican bilingual is positioned as a translingual communicator, influenced by their everyday investments in society (e.g., social practices), social circumstances (e.g., education, socioeconomic status, gender identity), as well as the mediatization that has transformed traditional boundaries of the so-called ""speech community"" (Jacquemet, 2019). Findings from this paper further illuminate the nature of languages in modern day Puerto Rico, particularly among the youth (Morales Lugo, 2019, 2020), making room for an additional narrative that envisions the smartphone as an extension of the human body.

During the Soviet period some repatriates corresponded with their friends and relatives abroad, and a few visits occurred. After 1991, this contact increased substantially, including at massive Harbintsy reunions held in Russia. After 1991 repatriates also began to enunciate how they, in contrast to ""local"" Russians (those born in the Soviet Union), were ""real"" Russians because they had been born and raised in a ""replica"" of Imperial Russia. Harbintsy abroad, meanwhile, had remained a distinct group within the Russian emigration, but they had still been exposed to a similar Russian émigré national identity. Yet when they reunited the two groups of Harbintsy often argued over who constituted a ""true"" Russian. Repatriates cited the importance of language, while Harbintsy abroad cited Russian Orthodoxy. Many Harbiners abroad insisted that repatriates admit they had made a mistake, while many repatriates pitied Harbiners abroad for not living in their historic homeland. Yet their love of Harbin united the two, and encouraged a global multi-ethnic identity as ""Harbintsy,"" bolstered by the return trips many made to China and the choice by many to consider Harbin their homeland.

In the mid-1930s when Korea was under Japanese rule (1910-1945), Yi Jong-su introduced Hughes's leftist vision to a Korean audience by translating ""Mother and Child"" and ""Cora Unashamed."" The medium of the magazine facilitated this global dissemination of Hughes. The act of translating pieces from contemporaneous non-Japanese-language periodicals was Korean intellectuals' deliberate means to keep abreast of proletarian developments in other countries while redressing Korea's reliance on the colonizer's cultural resources. By focusing on Hughes's depictions of African American workers and their interracial relationships, Yi encouraged Korean readers to imagine living otherwise when adhering to the system of oppression and exploitation was the normative condition. Yi's subversive practice of translation expands Hughes's radicalism as manifested in racial and sexual transgression.",Jang Wook Huh,,07/01/2022,,,,,Langston Hughes in Colonial Korea

These observations beg the question of what we are doing when we study the manuscripts of neglected, unpublished, and therefore unknown texts.

These locally-hired laborers have carried out the bulk of the shoveling, sifting, and dirt-hauling for most of the archaeological work in the region, but rarely appear in publications or even excavation archives. Their expertise and their perspectives on Middle Eastern archaeology have largely disappeared. But through a combination of ethnographic work, social network analysis, and emancipatory photography, Dr. Mickel will present some ways of seeing the often-invisible knowledge that local laborers possess about the archaeological work which has relied on them for so long. These strategies also suggest how anthropologist might adjust excavation methods to be more inclusive, and therefore more produce a more accurate and thorough archaeological record.",Allison Mickel,College of William &amp; Mary Anthropology Department Invited Homecoming Speaker,10/08/2021,https://events.wm.edu/event/view/homecoming/125077,,,,"The Invisible Experts of Middle Eastern Archaeology: In Stories, Networks, and Visions."

At issue is the question of whether open access poses more of a challenge to the for-profit publishing industry or to academics' control over the products of their work and effort. The ability to see open access at both ends of this spectrum is due, I argue, to a number of indeterminacies: how precarious academics actually are, the disciplinary differences in what access should be opened, and even the very definition of ""open access"" as a term. Most of all, though, the disparate framing of OA's effects on academic labor appears to be rooted in three different concepts of ""research:"" first, as a good, second, as a service, and third, as a ""goodly service""-- that is, a moral and even charitable act. In this paper, I trace these three concepts through the literature on OA advocacy and critique, illustrating how each one points to a particular future for OA and its relationship to academic labor. With this framework in mind, I argue that movements toward OA in archaeology must contend with the ways in which archaeological data is labor-in-process in order to protect against potential exploitative consequences forewarned by OA skeptics.",Allison Mickel,American Institute of Archaeology,01/08/2021,,,,,"Open Access Advocacy as Communist, as Capitalist: OA's Uncertain Effects on Academic Labor."

Even in the present, projects in Egypt and Iraq continue to employ the descendants of the highly capable, insightful, and often innovative men and women employed by archaeological expeditions in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Still, despite their importance for the success of archaeological projects, locally-hired laborers have almost never contributed to the documentation of archaeological sites. In fact, they are rarely even identifiable by name in publications and archives, leaving in question the precise ways in which archaeological excavation has relied on their abilities and information. Ethnography and oral history can help to uncover the contours and contributions of local expertise, but as with any act of uncovering, we may find things we do not anticipate—in particular, the ways in which labor management practices in Near Eastern archaeology have worked to reward local communities for hiding, rather than sharing, their knowledge about archaeological remains.

22484,FEL-273171-21,"Since the 1990's, a great deal of scholarly attention in archaeology has focused on our relationships to public, descendant, and local communities. Much has been written on the obligations that archaeologists have to those interested in and affected by our work, and within this body of literature, there is a theme of needing to hand over much control over the stewardship of the past to the communities that live in and around archaeological sites. This is particularly true in postcolonial contexts. For the past three years, I have been conducting an ethnography of two Jordanian startups aiming to respond to this ""local turn"" by developing business practices that build local capacity for heritage preservation and management. In this presentation, I present preliminary findings suggesting that the founders of these companies have been most successful when they are able to fluidly perform local and outsider identities, rather than one or the other. I argue that this is not simply about language fluency or class markers, but is in fact reflective of the economy of the global heritage industry.

Almost uniformly, best practices across these sectors state that local communities should be active participants in determining the future of the sites where they live. But much criticism of development and the global heritage regime aims at the frequent failure, on the ground, to meaningfully engage and empower local communities in decision-making and implementation processes. This paper starts differently-- by looking at the successes of two startup corporations in Jordan working to increase Jordanian involvement and agency over Jordan's cultural heritage, documented over five years of ethnographic fieldwork. I argue that these companies have been effective in securing funding and opportunities in cultural heritage when they have emphasized their ""vulnerable"" identity. In grant applications and pivotal meetings, the founders of these companies laid claim to the impoverishment and disappearing traditions of their Bedouin communities. At the same time, however, these companies relied on their connections with American and European archaeologists to satisfy the bureaucratic expectations of the international heritage regime. These companies' creative navigation through the many barriers to substantive community involvement lays bare how communities must satisfy opposed requirements in order to be legible for the purposes of ""community engagement:"" on the one hand, capable and cosmopolitan but on the other, underprivileged and vulnerable.",Allison Mickel,British Society for Middle Eastern Studies,07/07/2022,,,,,The Power of Underprivilege in Heritage Development

The elaboration of the Biblical story transforms into a critique of capitalism and industrialization, the source of the ambition and greed that provoke Cain's ultimate fratricide. Throughout the work, the moral force and thematic universality of the play is filtered through details of smallness, from the scale of the staging (three actors, no set, and only a few props) to the dedicated labors of the two brothers (Cain, who cultivates red peppers, and Abel, who gathers beetles).

11064,HR-20172-01,"Colombian theatre gained some relevance since the second half of the 20th century through a successful insertion in the ""Nuevo Teatro Latinoamericano"". This Nuevo Teatro was defined as essentially political, meaning an explicit engagement with social reality expressed in denouncing social injustices, uncovering the truth of State violence, reconstructing the memory of the acts of State terror, and calling their audiences to a public debate about the transformation of an unjust social order. In this paper, I propose that, since the 90s, face to the consolidation of neoliberalism and a long and deteriorated armed conflict in the country, this political commitment seems to have given way to a different kind of engagement: In the absence of effective State policies of truth, justice, and reparation, ""Theatre of Human Rights"", as termed by the Corporación Colombiana de Teatro, would work as a cultural medium for symbolic reparation. Thus conceived, the political task of theatre would be to restitute the victims' name, their dignity, their place in the social contract that binds the nation together, and of course, the humanity they have been stripped of by violent acts. I aim at interrogating this humanitarian approach, first by examining it in the light of a critique of Human Rights discourse, and second, by contrasting it with two contemporary plays that reflexively address the experience of violence and dehumanization beyond the idea of reparation: La técnica del hombre blanco by Víctor Viviescas and Donde se descomponen las colas de los burros, by Carolina Vivas.",Alejandra Marin Pineda,"Latin American Studies Association New York, New York, May 27 - 30, 2016",05/27/2016,,,,,eyond reparation: A response to the label “Theatre of Human Rights” in Colombia

11193,AQ-51006-14,"Technologies of copying – printing, casting, digital duplication – have always engendered debates about artistic authorship and invention. Copying can be viewed as a debasement and as creative praxis. Albrecht Dürer complained about copyists but also advised young artists learning to draw to ""copy the work of good masters until you attain a free hand."" Copying can also produce originality. Andy Warhol's copies of Brillo Boxes expose this paradox, asking (in Arthur Danto's words): ""What is the difference between two things, exactly alike, one of which is art and one is not?"" This session brought together papers addressing techniques and functions of artworks that copy other objects (drawings, prints, casts, rubbings, photographs) produced from the early modern period to today, as well as the legal, ethical, philosophical and ontological issues embedded in copying in Europe, Africa and the Americas. The session encouraged a far-reaching dialogue about the problematic status of the copy in the history of art.","Stephanie Porras, Lena Bader, Brigid von Preussen, Rebecca Jayne Wade, Adina Tamar Kamien-Kazhdan, Giulia Paoletti",College Art Association Annual Conference 2015,02/11/2015,http://conference2015.collegeart.org/programs/original-copies-art-and-the-practice-of-copying/,College Art Associatioin 2015 Conference online guide,,,Original Copies: Art and the Practice of Copying
11208,FB-57108-13,"This paper is based on selections from my forthcoming book on ""The Mediterranean in the Islamic Cartographic Imagination,"" which focuses on the Mediterranean maps that illustrate manuscript copies of al-I??akhri's Kitab al-masalik wa-al-mamalik (Book of Routes and Realms), abbreviated to KMMS. The reason for my focus on the KMMS tradition is that I aim to understand the most popular and widespread medieval Islamic mapping tradition. While there are other examples of Islamic mapping most of these are singleton traditions with limited copies whereas there are in excess of thirty cartographically illustrated copies of al-I??akhri's map manuscript extant. Their number make them by far the most commonly replicated cartographic image in the central lands of the medieval and early modern Islamic world and therefore useful for deconstruction if we want to understand what kind of information on the Mediterranean was communicated to people who were exposed to these images.",Karen Pinto,"Mediterranean Seminar Winter 2016 Workshop, Harvard University",3/4/2016,,,,,Masking Conflict with Harmony: The Two Faces of the KMMS Mediterranean Map
11209,FB-57108-13,Did medieval European maps influence the Islamic ones or vice versa? Or were they mutually exclusive? The question of Islamo-Christian cartographic connections is one of the major unresolved debates in the history of cartography. Scholars fall on both sides of the divide. A definitive answer to the question has been hampered by the lack of extant examples demonstrating Islamo-Christian cartographic connections.

I have spent the last two decades studying medieval Islamic maps in depth, in particular KMMS maps produced in the Kitab al-Masalik wa-al-Mamalik (Routes and Kingdoms) geographical manuscripts from the tenth century onwards. The maps of the Mediterranean, subject of my next book, consistently place Sicily at the center of their maps suggesting that the Muslims saw it as the central lynchpin of the Mediterranean around which the entire map was built. The question that I will explore in this paper is why Sicily is consistently placed as the central point of the medieval Islamic depiction of the Mediterranean.

This API was created as a method for addressing and extracting specific portions of music notation published in machine-readable formats on the web. Music notation, like text, can be ""addressed"" in new ways in a digital environment, allowing scholars to identify and name structures of various kinds, thus raising such questions as how can one virtually ""circle"" some music notation? How can a machine interpret this ""circling"" to select and retrieve the relevant music notation? The API was evaluated by: 1) creating an implementation of the API for documents in the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format; and by 2) remodelling a dataset of music analysis statements from the Du Chemin: Lost Voices project (Haverford College) by using the API to connect the analytical statements with the portion of notaiton they refer to.

11230,FA-58438-15,"In the summer of 1530, the empire's elite and the inhabitants of Constantinople gathered at the Hippodrome for the circumcision of Sultan Süleyman's sons Mehmed, Mustafa, and Selim. The celebrations, which lasted for twenty days, included a wide array of activities that extended from the highly formal (such as the ritual kissing of the sultan's hand by the members of the elite) to the carnivalesque (such as the plunder of large quantities of food by the commoners under the eyes of the sultan). The organizers of the event, who were the close collaborators of the sultan, sought to offer different types of entertainment that were tailored to the identities and expectations of various participants. Testimonies by contemporary Ottoman and Venetian observers provide information about these different entertainments, as well as the participants' reactions. The provision of entertainment was a kind of gift on the part of the sultan; at the same time, entertainment was construed as a group activity, through which several individuals and communities contributed to the celebrations. Particular forms of entertainment were seen as befitting specific groups; for instance, there was a class element, which manifested itself in the stark difference between refined and popular entertainments. Laughter, however, often transgressed these boundaries and brought together Ottoman and Venetian, bureaucrat and diplomat, and ship captain and merchant in their reactions to sundry spectacles. In my presentation, I will discuss the social and cultural scale across which different types of entertainment were constructed, adopted, and received/interpreted.",Kaya Sahin,The Ottomans and Entertainment,06/30/2016,,,http://skilliter.newn.cam.ac.uk/?p=261,The conference program can be downloaded from this link.,“From Pomp and Circumstance to Sheer Fun: Entertainments at an Ottoman Circumcision Ceremony (1530)”

11341,FT-60655-13,"This paper will analyze the important roles that the early twentieth-century Senegalese political leader Blaise Diagne played in the little-known cosmopolitan and anticolonial resistance of Francophone West Africans in which France played a major part during the first two quarters of the twentieth century.  In an attempt to reveal Diagne's contributions to this Francophone West African and anticolonial resistance tradition which had many intellectual, political, and cultural ramifications, this paper will chart the routes of the Senegalese leader's rise from his upbringing in colonial Senegal to his future emergence as one of the most prominent African anticolonial figures of the early twentieth century.  Drawing from the current scholarships about the black Atlantic intellectual tradition and Black Paris, this essay will interpret archival materials (such as letters, speeches, and newspaper articles) that Diagne wrote in the early twentieth century in order to respond to important issues such as black participation in World War I, the oppression of French colonialism in West Africa, and other issues in which black Atlantic intellectuals such as W.E.B Du Bois and Marcus Garvey were also involved.  By studying the different ways in which Diagne, Du Bois, and Garvey attempted to tackle the above problems through their speeches, correspondences, and articles about one another during the World War I era, my paper will reveal the primary role that Diagne played in the development of a Senegalese intellectual tradition that black Atlantic Studies have so far neglected.  Emphasizing the crucial role that Diagne played in this tradition that has been mostly credited to Western black intellectuals, this paper attempts to break new grounds where the complex writings and history of French African colonies could be properly understood.",Babacar M'Baye,Sixth Annual Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA) Conference,11/22/13,,,,,Blaise Diagne Speaks: The Cosmopolitan and Anticolonial Resistances of a Little-Known West African Francophone Leader

22612,PD-266988-19,"In this paper, I argue that dependent clauses in Eskaleut languages (Unangam Tunuu or Aleut, Yupik languages, Sirenikski, and Inuit) are more innovative morphologically than are independent clauses.  (The Eskaleut moods have been studied and reconstructed by numerous scholars (Hammerich 1936, Bergsland 1964, 1989, Fortescue 1984, 1995, 1998, and Vakhtin 1979, 1986); but they have not been explicitly studied from the perspective of this paper.) Dependency in Eskaleut clauses is indicated in part by verbal mood and person inflection.  The term ‘mood' covers several functions, including speech act, relative time in clause combination, and various types of dependence (embedded clauses, appositional clauses, etc.).  Eskaleut moods are typically divided as in the following table (parentheses and italics are explained below): IndependentDependent IndicativeConsequential (Interrogative)Conditional (Imperative/Optative)Conjunctive (Participial)…Language particular moods Moods frequently have multiple functions:  the conjunctive and participial moods, for example, often function independently, although structurally, they may be dependent.  Dependence is more clearly indicated by the person inflection that follows the mood.  Thus, person inflection in independent moods is morphologically similar to absolutive and relative possessed nominal inflection.  Dependent moods are characterized by subject inflection related to relative possessed nominal inflection; the differentiation of 3rd and 3rd coreferential persons; and unique object morphemes not otherwise found in the inflectional system. Some moods (indicated by parentheses in the table) have mixed person inflection, e.g. 1st and 2nd persons have independent inflection and 3rd person has dependent inflection.  Different languages do not show the same mixed inflections. A comparison of moods across the language family suggests that the original moods must have included the indicative, the conjunctive, the consequential, an",Anna Berge,Societas Linguistica Europea,08/26/2022,,,,,Innovation in Eskaleut Dependent Moods
22614,PD-266988-19,"Language contact is pervasive in the history of all Eskaleut languages of the Pacific Rim, and the languages show contact effect regardless of typological similarity or degree of relatedness.  Moreover, the degree of contact has allowed for the borrowing of features that are generally thought of as relatively impervious to borrowing, including verb inflection (cf. the pervasive Russian inflections in the well-known mixed language, Copper Island Aleut).  One aspect of Eskaleut morphosyntax that has generated a great deal of interest is the parallelism between possessive inflection on nouns and person inflection on verbs, and attempts to reconstruct the systems include Hammerich 1936, Bergsland 1951, 1964, 1989, Vakhtin 1979, 1986, Fortescue 1984, 1995, 1998, etc.  Most of these studies, despite acknowledging language contact, explain the modern reflexes of verbal person inflection in the respective languages via the traditional comparative method.  The many irregularities require much speculation, however, and the motivations for the proposed developments are not always evident.  For example, there are two variants of 2sgO verbal inflection, -t?n and -k?n, presumed to have come from an originally independent pronominal stem *t?k?-.  1sgS/2sgO forms almost universally involve the variant -k?n, while almost all others use -t?n.  Why this should be so is still unclear.  Many aspects of Eskaleut inflection remain obscure, despite the excellent studies listed above.  In this paper, I revisit the verbal inflection of the Eskaleut language Sirenikski, examining its systems of nominal and verbal person inflections within the context of the verbal mood system.  Sirenikski has been in close contact with Central Siberian Yupik (CSY) (as well as with non-Eskaleut Chukchi), and contact effects have been well described, including effects on its phonology, prosodic system, lexicon, and to a lesser extent on its derivational morphology.  Much less work has been devoted to teasing ou",Anna Berge,International Conference on Historical Linguistics,08/03/2022,,,,,Siberian Yupik Influence on Sirenikski Verbal Inflection

Thus, phonological, morphological, and syntactic features indicative of long-term contact are shared between different branches of the family (Inuit and Yupik, Sirenikski and Yupik), as well as between languages so distantly related that they are typologically different in important ways (Unangam Tunuu, aka Aleut, and Yupik, specifically Alutiiq).

22699,PD-266994-19,"This paper considers ways in which dynamics and mechanisms of language change may make crucial reference to spatially and temporally variable aspects of typological structure and sociolinguistic practice. Focusing on languages of the Amazon basin, and particularly those of the Naduhup language family, I present evidence for rates and pathways of grammaticalization that appear cross-linguistically unusual or extreme – relating to the rapid generation of new grammatical forms, lack of stability in inflectional and derivational morphology, evidence of ‘debonding' processes, synchronically flexible behavior of functional elements as more morphological or more syntactic, and relative promiscuity of grammatical elements' association with different word classes. Many of these phenomena can be linked to areally relevant structural characteristics, particularly the prevalence of verb serialization and noun incorporation, and an emphasis on nominalization as a subordination strategy. Many can also be shown to be grounded in locally salient sociolinguistic practices, most notably relating to zones of intensive, stable multilingualism, in which language contact has had a heavy hand in shaping rates and processes of change.","Epps, Patience","Invited colloquium talk, University of Oregon",10/22/2021,,,,,Exploring innovation in grammatical morphology: A view from the Amazon
22700,PD-266994-19,"The degree to which languages may retain components of a typological profile over time has significant implications for our understanding of deep-time family relationships and of the dynamics of language contact and change (cf. Nichols 1992, Dunn et al. 2005, Donohue et al. 2011, Dunn et al. 2011). Indeed, some language families have developed extensive internal typological diversity, even where their lexicons retain a clear signal of genealogical relationship. While language contact is often an obvious driver, internal processes of change are also crucially involved, such that new categories and structures emerge through processes of reanalysis and grammaticalization (e.g. Heine &amp; Kuteva 2005). Yet we still have much to understand regarding the mechanisms of these processes of change, especially where such restructuring affects many different components of the grammar. A key question in such cases is the following: to what extent are wide-ranging structural changes an assortment of relatively independent developments, versus an interconnected set within which specific catalysts may be identified? We consider these questions through the lens of Nadëb, a member of the small Naduhup language family of the northwest Amazon (Epps &amp; Bolaños 2017), drawing on our collaborative fieldwork with community members (initiated 2018) and on prior work by Weir (principally a 1984 MA thesis). Nadëb is the most structurally divergent member of the Naduhup family, with a number of features that stand out not only in contrast to its three sister-languages, but also as typologically noteworthy in their own right. In fact, however, as we explore here, the diachronic emergence of several of these features can be understood as closely interconnected – and apparently predicated primarily on the development of prefixes.","Patience Epps, Obert, Karolin,, Emily Luedke",Society for the Study of Indigenous Languages of the Americas annual meeting,01/30/2022,,,,,The mechanics of structural reorganization: The case of Nadëb prefixes.
22701,PD-266994-19,"From a typological perspective, one of Nadëb's most striking structural features is its preference for OAV constituent order, which is cross-linguistically very rare (see Weir 1984, 1986; Dryer 2013). As contact with Portuguese increases, one might anticipate pressure for Nadëb's secondary order – AVO – to become more prominent, particularly in material like the New Testament that has been translated directly from Portuguese. Here we consider this question through the lens of a discussion that took place in a community linguistics workshop during our fieldwork in 2019. When the topic of constituent order came up, community members launched into a heated debate: some observed that the OAV order was frequent in the speech of elders and was thus the ""only and right"" order, while others spoke out in favor of AVO because ""the New Testament [in its Nadëb translation] speaks like this"". Still others voiced acceptance for both patterns. This discussion among Nadëb community members highlights how speakers may experience language endangerment and change: While a full break in transmission or the loss of particular genres may be especially salient, speakers may also be aware of structural change, and of its connections to shifting domains of experience and to different views of authority as instantiated by elders, the state, or the church. Ultimately, these perceptions on the part of speakers are relevant in directing choices about what and how to document and revitalize in work with endangered languages.","Mark Simmons, Epps, Patience, Emily Luedke, Karol Obert","Workshop on American Indian Languages, UC Santa Barbara",04/30/2022,,,,,Constituent disorder?

However, new data from recent fieldwork suggest that ergativity is less pervasive in Nadëb than has been previously implied, and that neutral, nominative-accusative, and even tripartite alignment are also attested. Here, we assess Nadëb alignment across morphology and syntax, as attested in pronominal prefixing on verbs, constituent order and deletion patterns, and other phenomena. Diachronically, we argue that a number of these patterns are probably innovative, motivated by contact with neighboring Arawakan languages.","Patience Epps, Obert, Karolin, Emily Luedke","Fourth Symposium on Amazonian Languages (SAL 4), UC Berkeley",04/02/2022,,,,,Split ergatives or splitting hairs?

The Colombian press published articles speculating whether Colombia would be affected if the Cubans decided to target the Panama Canal, maps of possible nuclear fallout zones, and instructions about how to build a shelter and survive an atomic war. A headline in the newspaper El Espectador predicted that ""A Bomb in Panama Would Bring Us a Slow Death."" Another article warned readers that in the case of nuclear war, ""You have to think only of yourself. You cannot wait for friends… Any delay can be fatal."" An editorial in another newspaper, La República, reminded readers that ""It is possible that while you are reading these lines someone will have determined the extinction of all human life on Earth."" The coverage in the Colombian press reached such hysterical proportions that the newspapers started accusing each other of ""atomic terrorism."" This presentation, part of a larger project on the impact of the Cuban Missile Crisis across Latin America, explores why the Colombian coverage of the crisis was particularly alarmist.

For decades members of the klezmer community have dreamt of a centralized repository for klezmer tunes and their historical/ethnographic context, but creating such a resource within current archival structures leaves out a critical source of knowledge—klezmer culture bearers. These individuals have a deep understanding of repertoire, history, and folklore that is highly valued within the international klezmer community, but it is only available to the whole community when it is collected and organized. With this in mind, the Klezmer Archive project (KA) aims to create a universally accessible, useful resource for interaction, discovery, and research on available information about klezmer music. Like many folk/ethnic music communities, the international network of klezmer specialists includes musicians with a range of expertise but centers around  culture-bearers who collect and share information through performance, teaching, documentation/field work, recordings, and publishing. One of the core goals of the KA project is documenting the networks of human contact through which cultural (musical) information is exchanged in ways that are not reflected by traditional metrics, such as quantity/location of performances, books published, or recording catalog (all of which have many well-worn paths for documentation).  The Klezmer Archive project is adapting and extending the DoReMus ontology (itself a harmonization of CIDOC CRM and FRBRoo, extending classes and properties specific to musical data, and a set of shared multilingual vocabularies) to document human relationships.

22732,RA-264487-19,"Globally, ""men's rights"" movements (MRMs) span pro-feminist men's groups addressing harms of sex roles, a variety of alt-right type men's organizations, alongside charitable and human-rights and environmental associations. Crucially, many of them, across the political spectrum, represent masculinity through an affective politics of abjection. The Indian MRM (like the global International Men's Day association) leans into ideas of vulnerability, loneliness and exclusion in an assertive, aggressive mode that takes simultaneous aim at feminists (especially governance linked to feminist ideas) and women (synecdochally standing in for wives) as being at the root of their plight. It locates itself within the language of human rights and gender equity, identified as the dominant discourse of inclusion (and hence of resources) in our times. This paper demonstrates the ways that the Indian MRM inscribes vulnerability and abjection onto itself. It locates the MRM within prevailing global men's rights discourses of health and harm, and follows the ways they highlight masculinity as debility, and men's health as the prime crisis, providing evidence for men's economic and social abandonment through the bodies of poor men or suicide. Drawing on such woundedness, MRAs (men's rights activists) can deflect or justify accusations of violence, and critique law and punishment. Through close readings of an exhibition sponsored by the central MRM organization, performative public actions, and the circulation of narratives about death, the paper shows the affective momentum the movement seeks to accumulate, and the forms of resistance it champions.",Srimati Basu,"Global Anti-Gender and Anti-LGBTQ+ Politics: Historical Continuities, Transnational Connections, Contested Futures",10/28/2022,https://ceeres.uchicago.edu/news/global-anti-gender-and-anti-lgbtq-politics-historical-continuities-transnational-connections,conference web site,,,Asserting Vulnerability as Anti-Gender Politics: Indian Antifeminist Men’s Rights Activists’ Claims to Gendered Harm

Hinton is likely introducing Bessie Jones and the Georgia Sea Island Singers, the Greenbriar Boys, Jean Ritchie, and other featured performers at the December 1962 Winter Berkeley Folk Music Festival. Sitting upright and attentive, front row center, is a familiar-looking beatnik. He listens intently to Hinton, who is perhaps drawing on ideas from the previous day's workshop ""Learning to Sing Folk Songs—Tradition and Imitation,"" held with esteemed folklorists Ralph Rinzler and Charles Seeger, and also building on his 1955 Western Folklore essay ""The Singer of Folk Songs and His Conscience."" The young man is none other than aspiring folk/bluegrass musician Jerry Garcia. This and other newly discovered photographs of Garcia at the 1962 Winter Berkeley Folk Music Festival ask us to revisit how the young musician absorbed ideas from the folk music revival, particularly what an ""imitator"" could do with traditions not his own. These ideas would stay with Garcia for the rest of his life and career. Taking in Hinton's words, singing along with the Georgia Sea Island Singers at a ""Fireside Sing,"" hanging out with Rinzler, Ritchie, and other performers and attendees, Garcia encountered debates about what it meant to try to incorporate folk music styles into one's very being rather than merely present them as antiquated museum specimens. Garcia's Zelig-like presence at the 1962 Berkeley Folk Music Festival raises important questions about race, class, region, and authenticity as they moved through vernacular musical expression in the early 1960s, particularly in Atomic Age California; this helps us reconsider what a transmitter of tradition could be within the disorienting context of postwar America.",Michael Kramer,2022 Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association Conference,4/12/2022,,,,,The Singer of Folk Songs: Jerry Garcia at the 1962 Winter Berkeley Folk Music Festival &amp; Rethinking Folk Revival Modes of Interpreting Traditional Music

22813,FN-279286-21,"Jarawan languages figure prominently into longstanding debates among Africanists concerning their classification relative to non-Bantu Bantoid vs. Narrow Bantu languages. Recent scholarship on the matter – namely Blench 2006, Grollemund 2012, and Grollemund et al. 2018 – contends, based primarily on what is known of their lexicon, that Jarawan belongs within Bantu Group A (specifically alongside Mbam-Bubi languages, A31-40-60), though perspectives on their precise place within the group differ between scholars. This paper, based on data collected over the last three years on Mbat [iso:bau] and more recently on Duguri [iso:dbm], calls into question such a determination, illustrating that although ~20% of the Jarawan lexicon is indeed cognate with Bantu, these same items are also cognate with Bantoid. This suggests, therefore, that these vocabulary items entered the lexicon via some pre-Bantoid proto language. We illustrate that there are indeed no clear lexical innovations linking Jarawan to Bantu, including to any A40 or A60 languages. Any evidence presumed in favor of their inclusion in Bantu by vestigial nasal prefixes observed on some nouns can also be set aside, as these too are found in Eastern Grassfields languages (Hyman 1980, 2018). In further support of our determination that Jarawan languages are properly classified among other non-Bantu Bantoid languages, we present data on the Jarawan verbal system showing that the languages exhibit all and only those six verbal extensions that Hyman (2018) reconstructs for Proto-Grassfields. Furthermore, we show that these extensions are fully aspectual in the synchronic grammar of these languages, which in turn places Jarawan within ""Stage 3"" of Hyman's trajectory concerning the development of aspectual function from extensions earlier involved in valency changing operations. As such, Jarawan is perhaps a step beyond even some other Bantoid languages in this regard, as Hyman proposes that Bantoid languages, as a group,","Christopher R.

22814,FN-279286-21,"Jarawan languages have long fascinated Africanists, and particularly historical linguists and linguistic typologists. They stand near the cusp of the Bantoid-Narrow Bantu divide, with descriptions and classifications dating back to the early 20th century making claims that they belong in one group vs. the other. Until recently, however, remarkably little is known about them beyond wordlists, some of which contain only a few dozen words, and a single short descriptive paper. The most recent classifications based on extensive comparison and advances in lexicostatistic modeling claim that they belong among the Group A Narrow Bantu, though details differ from scholar to scholar. In this paper, it is illustrated that data collected over the last three years on three Jarawan languages, and subsequent reanalysis of existing wordlists and the sound changes observed therein, do not support the same conclusion. From a lexical standpoint, it is shown that while Jarawan languages indeed share approximately 20 percent of their cognates with Proto Bantu, these same cognates are also shared with Proto Grassfields, and often with Proto Benue-Congo; they cannot be shared Bantu innovations. From a morphological standpoint, it will be shown that Jarawan languages appear more akin to certain Grassfields languages. Lastly, in terms of diachronic sound changes, whereas North-Western Bantu languages display two significant phonological innovations, these innovations are not observed in Jarawan languages. Thus, based on lexical cognates, sound changes, and morphology, this paper revisits and bolsters arguments in favor of a re-classification of Jarawan languages among other Bantoid",Christopher R.

Most of them were free and traveling on their own account. Some had been born on the African continent, but many planned to return to where they had been born enslaved or freed in the Caribbean or to another destination in the archipelago. This small wave of migration differed from the thousands of Africans and their descendants who had often arrived enslaved in Bordeaux earlier in the eighteenth century often to return to bondage in the Caribbean.  By contrast, the group of people of color featured in this article were practicing their freedom when they prepared to set sail even as they moved closer to the beating heart of slavery when they traveled west. At the same time, the records they left in the archive provide clues about prevailing racial ideologies in France and shine a light on community formation and affective ties among people of color who otherwise have been rendered invisible.

22833,FEL-273714-21,"Black Bordeaux originated in the waterways and terrains of West Africa, West Central Africa, and the Caribbean as much as it did in the streets of Bordeaux. On one hand, the changing dynamics of the transatlantic slave trade with West and West Central Africa shaped the enslaved labor brought to Bordeaux during the eighteenth century. How is it possible to account for the elusive memories and ideas of the enslaved, particularly those born in West and West Central Africa, who arrived on the shores of the Garonne River, on the other? Different overlapping groups of people who contributed to the creation of this nascent Black community were shaped, if not, weighed down, by their experiences, especially the horrific ordeal of their enslavement. Notable numbers of West African children arrived in the first decades of the eighteenth century as the sociopolitical landscape of what is now Benin and underwent significant change. By the middle of the century, as French traders shifted their attention further south, a larger number of enslaved West Central Africans – caught up in a different set of circumstances – began to pour in from the area north of the Congo River from a region that includes the Congo Republic (Brazzaville) and an enclave of Angola. In fact, by the middle of the century forward, many people of color who arrived – some of them freed – had only known life in the entrenched plantation societies of the Caribbean. This chapter explores the methodological limits available to analyze how African-born enslaved and freed people engaged in space-making outside of the African continent and the physical site of the Caribbean plantation complex. The use of linguistics, archaeology, and oral narratives – used by scholars of Africa and/or the Caribbean are ever more elusive in this context as the stories of the enslaved who came before Black Bordeaux are at the interstices of the written and unwritten.",Lorelle Semley,Emory University Institute for African Studies,4/21/2022,,,,,The Birth of Black Bordeaux

In 1905, American colonial authorities established a leper colony in Culion, an isolated island in Palawan. Victor Heiser, Director of Health in the Philippines from 1905 to 1915, declared that to ensure public health, it was necessary to isolate lepers; this meant, in many instances, forcibly removing them from their homes and relocating them to Culion. But how did individuals who were suspected of having leprosy respond to Heiser during his ""leper collecting trips"" throughout the country? What was life like for those who were brought to Culion, and how did they engage with government authorities over such issues as the segregation of patients by gender and the ban on cohabitation and marriage? &#x0D; &#x0D; This paper seeks to advance our understanding of Filipino leprosy patients' engagement with American colonial authorities, an understudied theme in the literature on empire and public health policy, and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines.

These institutions and providers have different and often conflicting priorities and models of health and illness. Military providers and leaders must integrate generating mental health, expressed as resilience, with the need to put ""boots on the ground."" They must manage conflicts between the warrior ethos, in which mental suffering represents weakness and defeat, and the need for soldiers to access treatment. The Veterans Administration and Tri-Care are necessarily concerned with treating mental illness and ensuring that patients receive evidence-based care. In contrast, community-based providers and organizations seek to assist military personnel with reintegration into civilian life following deployments or leaving military service for which evidence of effectiveness may be more individualized and elusive. Constrained by the institutional focus on treatment of disease, soldiers, their families and civilian providers and agencies nonetheless exercise individual and institutional agency to assist military personnel and families with a variety of needs related to reintegration: from practical issues of housing, employment, education, and adaptive housing, to re-establishing intimate relationships and spiritual and moral healing. High levels of suicide, substance use, and homelessness among veterans attest to the skill and support required to navigate this complex terrain and the health disparities that ensue when they cannot.","Scandlyn, Jean N.",American Anthropological Association,11/21/2015,,,,,“Reintegration or Treatment: How Military Personnel and Families Seek Mental Health among Competing Models of Care.”

11400,FB-56565-12,"If recycling is a harbinger of a more sustainable society, then the lead-acid battery industry offers an apparent model of success.  In the United States, more than 95 percent of lead-acid batteries are recycled. The battery industry describes this ""closed loop"" as the ""environmental success story of our time.""  But there is a catch: this is not actually new.  The lead industry has been recovering lead from spent batteries on an industrial scale since the 1920s.  This presentation will consider how this system has evolved historically:  How have the stocks and flows of lead changed over time?  Where have the greatest threats to human and environmental health emerged?  How has the lead-acid battery system and those risks been affected by environmental policy, changes in scientific assessments related to the risks of lead exposure, and the activism of national and community-based organizations?  Considering the environmental history of lead-acid batteries reveals a complex and volatile industry shaped by dramatic swings in recycling rates historically, with disproportionate impacts on specific communities.  More recently, tightening EPA regulations have pushed lead-acid recycling activities abroad, with consequences for human and environmental health that belie any simplistic claims about ""environmental success.""",James M.

11401,FB-56565-12,"In 2011, the U.S. alkaline battery industry made a surprising announcement:  it aimed to launch a national program to recycle the billions of AA, AAA, 9-volt, and other alkaline batteries in the United States.  It was a surprising turnabout for an industry that as late as 2000 had publicly opposed any efforts to promote recycling.  To understand this reversal requires engaging with two interrelated narratives.  First, is the longer history of the battery industry's efforts to detoxify batteries, specifically by removing mercury from alkaline cells.  Indeed, as late as the 1980s, batteries accounted for .005% of the municipal waste stream by weight, but approximately 50% of mercury waste.  Getting the mercury out of batteries was a significant environmental achievement for the industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s in response to new environmental policies and advances in hydrometallurgical technology (which entailed new environmental costs).  Second, a new push for product stewardship, justified by life-cycle analyses, sparked a renewed push for recycling in the 2000s, first in Europe and then the United States.  This marked a change, because since the early 1990s, the industry had publicly argued against recycling batteries, since they were non-toxic.  To understand the significance of this turn toward battery recycling requires engaging with the history of existing mining, waste, and recycling infrastructure: How do existing systems of waste management and metals processing in Europe and the U.S. affect the efficiency of battery recycling?  Why has a mining industry that has proven so adept at extracting a wide array of minerals from ever lower-grade ore, struggled to extract those same metals from the stream of spent batteries?  This paper deploys an envirotechnical approach -- drawing on environmental history and history of technology -- to consider the historical intersection of technology, policy, environment, and economy to answer these questions",James M.

11520,AC-50156-12,"The changes in the defining ideas of the&#x0D; contemporary world, the exponential growth of knowledge, and&#x0D; the expansion of technological innovations have created a need&#x0D; for a critical examination of the convergences and connections&#x0D; between the sciences, engineering, and the humanities. Today,&#x0D; there are areas of study so complex that they go beyond confines&#x0D; of a single discipline. Examples of such areas include (1) the&#x0D; comparative study of concepts of mind, consciousness, and&#x0D; machines, (2) the critique of the technological culture through&#x0D; appropriate and alternative technology approaches, and (3) the&#x0D; questions surrounding cosmology, evolution, and beliefs.&#x0D; In response to this, we have developed interdisciplinary, teamtaught,&#x0D; general education courses on artificial intelligence,&#x0D; appropriate technology, and the origins of the universe that&#x0D; respond to the above challenges, while fostering the ability of our&#x0D; students to use skill sets and concepts from different and&#x0D; divergent disciplines in order to examine such complex areas of&#x0D; study.

11576,FT-248848-16,"Public health was vital to the success of the American pacification campaign and the civilizing process in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. In 1907, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. 1711, which mandated the compulsory segregation and isolation of leprosy patients to the island of Culion in Palawan. Victor Heiser, Director of Health from 1905 to 1915, declared that to protect public health it was necessary to isolate lepers; this meant, in many instances, forcibly removing them from their homes and relocating them to Culion. Health authorities had downplayed Filipino leprosy patients' opposition to the segregation order. Heiser authoritatively claimed the ""collection of lepers"" proceeded smoothly. When compared to the population of the Culion leper colony within a given year, the number of ""absconders"" was small. Although this number may seem small and insignificant, it renders invisible a wide array of responses the segregation policy generated among the Filipino leprosy patients and suspected lepers – men and women, young and old, rich and poor alike.&#x0D; &#x0D; This paper is part of my larger project on the social history of leprosy patients in Culion during the American colonial period. It advances our understanding of the engagement between Filipino leprosy patients and colonial authorities. This is an understudied theme in the literature on empire and public health policy and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Earlier studies of Culion highlight its role as a laboratory for civic experimentation and how it was embroiled in major political issues of the day. Drawing on a wide array of sources including government reports, personal papers of colonial officials, and letters of leprosy patients and their families, this paper demonstrates how Filipino leprosy patients and suspected lepers challenged a public health program that, as scholars have pointed out, served as rationale for ""America's imperialist venture"" in the Philippines.",Febe Pamonag,Western Illinois University Department of History Faculty Colloquium,10/27/2016,,,,,"Contesting the Health Authorities' ""Leper Collecting Trips"" to the Philippine Provinces, 1900s-1930s"

While the predilection for Gothic tropes in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Russian literature has been typically interpreted as a tribute to the fashionable Western trend, Haunted Empire argues that, instead, Russian Gothic fiction was a key literary form that dramatized deep historical and cultural tensions unique to the Russian imperial situation: a peculiar symbiosis of the imperial and national identities; blurred boundaries between the subjects and objects of colonization and imperial dominance; and instability of the relationship between center and periphery. This study applies the ""North/South"" geocultural axis, typical of British Gothic literature, to the particularly Russian situation where the Finnish/Baltic ""North"" and the Ukrainian ""South"" figure as colonized Others that are paradoxically integral to Russia's own mythology of origins.

11652,FA-58550-15,"The unfinished and untitled text now known as Jean Santeuil was begun by Proust in&#x0D; 1895 and largely abandoned by the end of 1899. Proust had misgivings about the text's generic&#x0D; status: ‘Puis-je appeler ce livre un roman ?,' he writes in an unlabeled, incomplete manuscript&#x0D; page that stops mid-sentence. Bernard de Fallois, the editor of the first published version (1952), tidied up Proust's disorderly manuscript into a narrative that followed the conventions of a novel of formation. A later version edited by Pierre Clarac (1971) attempted to restitute some the fragmentary nature of the text, but largely maintained Fallois's reorderings. As noted by Jean-Yves Tadié in his update of Clarac's version (2001), a complete critical edition of Jean Santeuil remains to be done. Proust's strikethroughs and revisions, most notably, are not fully transcribed in any published version; the recent digitization of the manuscript (2014) makes them visible for the first time.&#x0D; &#x0D; The manuscript reveals the young Proust's hesitations in matters of gender as well as&#x0D; genre, particularly around questions of reading and desire. Love scenes are rewritten to erase&#x0D; hints of gender ambiguity. Scenes of shared reading – precursors to the solitary reading scenes in&#x0D; À la recherche du temps perdu – can be dated to 1895, when Proust was enamored with the&#x0D; composer Reynaldo Hahn, since these sections of the manuscript are written on the same paper&#x0D; used by Proust and Hahn to write letters in the fall of that year. Considering Jean Santeuil less as a novel than as a composite text, alongside Proust and Hahn's letters, allows for unexpected&#x0D; insight into the Proustian theory of reading, through its links to Proust's experiences and&#x0D; conceptions of queerness. By undoing earlier editorial efforts toward generic purity and returning to the manuscript, we uncover a different text, and a different way of reading Proust.","Proulx, François",Nineteenth-Century French Studies Colloquium,11/7/16,https://ncfs2015.princeton.edu/,,,,Reading the Improper in Jean Santeuil

Scholars have recognized the influence of Walker's Appeal on Apes's ""Looking-Glass""—both published as pamphlets in Boston in 1829-30 and 1833, respectively—but have left unconsidered the significant influence of Jefferson's Notes on both.  Walker based his scathing response to Jefferson in his controversial pamphlet on the eighth American edition of Notes, published in Boston in 1801.  This edition includes the so-called Logan appendix, in which Jefferson defends his inclusion of Chief Logan's well-known 1774 speech as evidence for his argument respecting Native American eloquence and, thus, intellectual capacity in Notes.  Challenged as a fraud in a series of letters penned by his political enemies and published in newspapers in the 1790s, Jefferson found himself compelled to revisit his ideas about authorship and authority that he had articulated in Query XIV as important elements in his conclusions about the intellectual capacities of whites, Native Americans, and people of African descent.  Significantly, Jefferson deploys what Meredith McGill has termed ""the culture of reprinting"" as an important part of his self-defense as an author, arguing that he was only one among countless reprinters of the Logan speech rather than its originator.  I argue that David Walker and William Apes perceived this tension between the different editions of Notes—specifically between the Logan appendix and Query XIV— and exploited it to challenge Jefferson's conclusions about blacks' and Indians' abilities as authors.

In the past several decades ""cultural memory"" has developed as a term to describe the ways societies remember their past using a variety of media (Astrid Erll and Ann Rigney). In this context, virtually any object of literary and cultural studies is a work of remembering, even as it at once evokes and takes root in readers' and viewers own memories, a process that takes place on the collective as well as personal level. Together our papers demonstrate that by bringing the interdisciplinary tools of memory studies into the classroom, we are able to create an ""official"" disciplinarily structured space for exploring the contents and operations of memory both in an object of study and at the interface of object and viewer/readers, thus opening an awareness of memory as a life practice that is fluid, creative, and shared.",Martha Rust and Suzanne England,Modern Language Association Annual Convention,01/05/2017,https://apps.mla.org/program details?prog id=154&amp;year=2017,MLA Convention Program,,,Teaching Memory Studies: Special Session at the annual convention of the Modern Language Association

11805,FT-53201-05,"Drawn from my book-in-progress, this paper thus uses Silas Marner and Very Hard Cash to urge a broader point about mid-Victorian fiction: that in its many returns to this conception of subjectivity as thoroughly interpenetrated by the problems of capital, mid-century novels express a peculiar anxiety regarding the systematic erosion, or perhaps even collapse, of the boundary that nominally divides property from subjectivity—an erosion that has its roots, as I argue elsewhere in the book, in the rise of autobiography as a commercial genre during the period 1825-1860. In the larger project, I explore the historical realities and theoretical possibilities of this pivotal moment when autobiography, alongside developments in photography, copyright law, and even census-taking and licensure, made subjectivity into ""portable property"" designed explicitly for the Victorian marketplace. More immediately here, I argue that Eliot's and Reade's novels interrogate certain implications of this development by revealing the extent to which, by mid-century, subjectivity had come already to be conceived as property, structured like it, interchangeable with it, and vulnerable to dangerous rules of ownership and exchange. Both novels rely upon a mode of representation that figures economic loss as both mental and sexual trauma—as a sudden annihilation of the self, in the senses of both the linguistic ability to express subjectivity and the intrinsic desire that ought to sustain it. In each case, the initial preoccupation with networks of capitalist accumulation and exchange gives way, by novel's end, to a much more alarming recognition: that the subject has already been pervaded by, and cannot do without, capitalism's textual, imaginative, and representational demands.",Sean Grass,North American Victorian Studies Association,9/27/12,,,,,Capitalist Accumulation and Financial Fraud: The Psychoeconomics of Loss in Silas Marner and Very Hard Cash

11806,FT-53201-05,"Drawn from my book in progress, this paper argues that the new demand for names constitutes and expresses an ideology that was, at mid-century, deliberately turning identity into a textual thing, a form of property pervaded by the forms of social power that capitalism was generally bringing to bear upon the Victorian subject. The book argues broadly that during the first half of the nineteenth century, the impulse to textualize the subject and so turn it into an object of exchange characterizes several early-Victorian cultural formations, chief among them the commercial rise of autobiography during 1820-1860. More to the point, and in the case of the census, the impulse to textualize and economize the subject found expression also in the wide formalization of official technologies—registries, licensing, and copyright, among others—that brought the subject into legal existence by giving it concrete form. Given the explicitly economic origins of the original Census Act in 1801, I want to focus this essay on the 1841 revision, which turned a novel mechanism for economic aggregation and classification into something much more personal, and to consider the complex implications of that revision against the nexus of subjectivity-text-commodity that characterized the emergent capitalism of the 1840s.",Sean Grass,North American Victorian Studies Association,11/12/14,,,,,Subjective Economies and the Victorian Census

During particularly the 1850s, autobiography proliferated at an unprecedented rate and came into its own for the first time as a deliberately commercial genre. In response, Victorian reviewers wondered openly, and often angrily or anxiously, about the culturally insidious implications of this new tendency to turn private identity itself into a kind of ""portable property"" available for capitalist exchange. My aim, then, is to articulate a new way of thinking about the form, function, and ideological significance of Victorian autobiography as it ""rose"" to literary and commercial prominence.",Sean Grass,Nineteenth-Century Studies Association,4/13/16,,,,,"""Mr Mudie's sins"": Victorian Autobiography, the Book Market, and Critical Response"
11808,FT-53201-05,"Between 1820 and 1860, autobiography became for the first time an explicitly commercialized genre of English prose. As it did, it provoked significant anxieties about the cultural and imaginative status of identity in a capitalist marketplace that made it into a textual object vulnerable to the dynamics of ownership and exchange. This anxiety appears most obviously in contemporary reviews, which passed from general hostility to the practice of ""turning a penny"" by writing autobiography to more specific complaints about the forms in which identity was obliged to appear—and the mutilations it had to undergo—to satisfy the requirements of the mid-century book market. This paper focuses particularly on the rhetoric of these reviews around 1860, at the close of Victorian autobiography's last major commercial peak, exploring the shifting nature and increasing precision of reviewers' complaints regarding the autobiographies of Mary Granville Delany, Hester Lynch Piozzi, and the Irish novelist Lady Morgan. In part, the reviews published during these years suggest that frustrations and anxieties reached their greatest intensity as autobiographical production crested during the 1850s, and they further suggest a gendered response when female identity, particularly, became a commodity in the literary market. But they also imply—in complaints about the length of such autobiographies, their factual inaccuracies, and the ways in which these problems were atonements for ""Mr. Mudie's sins""—an acute sense of the extent to which autobiographies were reshaping identities, and the very idea of identity, to suit the exigencies of the Victorian literary market.",Sean Grass,Research Society for Victorian Periodicals,9/10/16,,,,,Remaking Victorian Subjectivity: Autobiography and Critical Response
11809,FT-53201-05,"Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone begins as a detective story and ends—arguably, at least—as a prototypical attempt at psychoanalysis, with Ezra Jennings piecing together Dr. Candy's unconscious utterances and coaxing Franklin Blake into equally unconscious repetitions to discover the mystery of the missing Indian. More mysterious even than the disappearance of the stone, however, is the alchemy by which Collins converts the story of a missing object into the story of a missing subjectivity, as if neither The Moonstone's readers nor its internal logic can quite recognize the difference between the two. Taken from Chapter 5 of my book-in-progress, Life upon the Exchange, this paper argues that Collins's novel offers a crucial vision of subjectivity as it was remade during the middle of the nineteenth century, when the rise of autobiography as a deliberately commercial genre coincided with the advent of several other technologies—copyright law, the census, the photograph—for taking subjectivity, giving it a textual (and therefore material) form, and thus transforming it into a commodity thoroughly vulnerable to the dynamics of economic exchange. In its polyvocal first-person form, in Jennings's interventions, in the involutions of its plot, and in the drama of a fabulous diamond that threatens to lose its talismanic ""identity"" if it is sent off to be cut into several perfect—and, economically speaking, more valuable—stones, Collins's novel deals in many of the tropes for representing commoditized identity that I examine in Life upon the Exchange.",Sean Grass,North American Victorian Studies Association,11/5/16,,,,,"Autobiography, Textuality, Commodity: Sacred Identity in The Moonstone"

Because famines played an important role in China's long history, conquering hunger became a key legitimizing principle for the Chinese Communists, who came to power in 1949 promising that ""not one person would starve to death"" under their rule.  Given this context, when famine conditions began to spread across China in 1959 due to policies connected to the Great Leap Forward, it became increasingly dangerous for observers on any level to admit that a major famine was in fact occurring.  Instead, jettisoning both time-honored famine relief strategies and traditional icons of starvation, the Party developed a new lexicon that sought to end the massive famine without ever acknowledging its existence. This paper explores the use of four key phrases -- ""produce to provide relief for yourself"" (????), ""food substitutes"" (???), ""swelling disease"" (???) and ""women's illnesses"" (???) -- that are ubiquitous in archival documents from the Great Leap Famine. The first two phrases, I argue, introduced new ""relief"" strategies that aimed to increase the amount of food available in rural China without reducing high grain quotas, while the last two demonstrate how cadres medicalized starvation to explain soaring death rates and plummeting birth rates without acknowledging famine conditions.",Kathryn Edgerton-Tarpley,"The Historical Society for Twentieth Century China conference on the theme of “Building a Socialist Society""",8/6/2021,http://hstcconline.org/conferences/2021-hstcc-mini-conference/,"2021 HSTCC Mini-Conference – August 6, 2021",,,"From Food Substitutes to Women's Illnesses:  Icons of Starvation for a  Socialist Society ""Without Famine"""

Because both acknowledging famine conditions and reducing high grain quotas were politically dangerous during the Great Leap disaster, cadres at all levels engaged in a pronounced ""medicalization of starvation.""  Rising mortality rates were attributed to ""fuzhongbing"" (edema), and plummeting birthrates were blamed on ""funübing"" (women's diseases), in particular amenorrhea and uterine prolapse. Finding it politically untenable to provide relief grain, between 1959 and 1961 officials at the provincial and county levels instead sent large teams of medical personnel to rural areas to treat the starving with a combination of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and biomedicine.  This paper focuses on how the 1950s campaign to unify Chinese and Western medicines shaped the top-down and bottom-up development of an eclectic mix of treatments for amenorrhea (the cessation of menstruation in women of child-bearing age) and uterine prolapse during the famine.  I also examine how, by whom, and to what effect these therapies were used to treat famished women in severely-affected counties in Anhui and Henan.  I find that while medical interventions did little to address the root cause – starvation and overwork -- of these ""women's diseases,"" the exhaustive search for cures provides a vivid snapshot of Mao-era medical theory, gender ideals, and state responses to public health crises.",Kathryn Edgerton-Tarpley,Association of Asian Studies Annual Conference,3/27/2022,https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/AAS-AC-2022-Conference-Booklet-Web-FINAL-R1.pdf,AAS conference program.,,,"From Motherwort to Progesterone Injections: Fighting Famine with Chinese and Western Medicine, 1958-1962"

The wartime Henan Famine, which killed between 1 and 3 million people, occurred in the context of both a severe drought in North China's strategically important Henan Province, and a brutal tri-polar struggle between the invading Japanese army, China's Nationalist government, and Chinese Communist forces.  During the famine, Nationalist government officials in unoccupied parts of Henan and its neighboring provinces, as well as their Communist rivals located in base areas behind Japanese lines, promoted gendered work relief campaigns that aimed to feed starving women by arranging for them to earn grain by spinning and weaving cloth.  Missionary relief workers and other foreigners active in wartime China launched similar endeavors.  These campaigns had patriotic, economic and social goals, including supporting China's wartime resistance by engaging famine refugees in textile production that could address serious wartime shortages, and curtailing the widespread practice of selling famished girls and women as child brides or prostitutes.  In the case of the spinning and weaving movement organized by the Communists in their Taihang Base area in 1942, women's spinning co-operatives also aimed to ""liberate"" women and change production relations within the family.

22885,RQ-266249-19,"The question of ""Who owns this?"" has long loomed over Porgy and Bess, the 1935 opera about a Gullah Geechee community in a Charleston tenement called Catfish Row. The representation of marginalized communities is always fraught, and this piece is especially contentious because it was created by outsiders—the Russian-Jewish brothers George and Ira Gershwin, and the White Charleston couple DuBose and Dorothy Heyward. Despite ongoing debates about the work, particularly its treatment of race, there has been troublingly little focus on the Gullah people.  My presentation also evaluates Porgy and Bess in the larger context of controversies surrounding representation, focusing particularly on the discourse among Black intellectuals around the time the opera and its source materials were written. Sterling A. Brown warned against looking down on places like Catfish Row, and noted the importance of proper framing. In 1959, James Baldwin observed that what Porgy and Bess and its audiences were missing is how the story is shaped by the realities of life in the Jim Crow south. A closer examination of the score and libretto, including several revealing lines that are either cut or sanitized in most productions, reveals that thoughtful productions could make for an effective vehicle for greater understanding.

To date, no significant empirical interventions have been carried out on this topic. Our series of studies has begun to shed some light on this important topic by building off of related work in the domain of human-robot interaction (Kuchenbrandt et al. 2014). We hypothesized that there would be a series of at least nine interactions between AI-, participant-, and task-gender. Initial results support this complex picture. We found, for instance, that participants are more likely to assign tasks to feminized- versus masculinized-AIs (t(416) = 2.82, adjusted p &amp;lt; .05), and this effect is pronounced for male-participants assigned to feminized-activities (t(415) = 2.82, adjusted p &amp;lt; .05).","Hannah Read, Javier Gomez-Lavin, Andrea Beltrama, Lisa Miracchi Titus",Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology 2022 in Mobile Alabama,3/30/22,,,,,Measured interactions of task and labor allocation to feminized AIs
22901,FEL-282501-22,"This talk aimed to refocus the discussion of weaponized robots away from their potential physical and moral capacities, embracing instead an empirically more effective and morally more accurate focus on what information humans require to make ethical decisions about them. Humans can't be required to be infallible nor have perfect information; they cannot even require the ability to abort their robots' commanded tasks throughout a mission since there are already many extant systems that don't carry such guarantees. Human capability to conform to the rules of engagement and LOAC can't be accomplished by merely restricting some specific scope of activity (e.g. machine may select but human must explicitly permit a lethal action) since technology is changing so rapidly. Interjecting human in loop does not necessarily increase control (e.g., if there are significant lags in communications). Introducing the notion of permissible uncertainty focuses on the appropriate epistemic conditions concerning what humans need to know or be able to think about. Traditional LOAC already accounts for an increased degree of abstraction up the chain of command which doesn't vitiate human responsibility and accountability. Permissible uncertainty for humans commanding lethal robot systems analogously requires knowing with adequate certainty that command will be accurately carried out. Several examples from the literature further motivate the appeal to permissible uncertainty by illuminating the futility of seeking specific restrictions or increased human control tied to specific levels of robot capability. Finally, this view clarifies what is needed from robotics as a discipline: designing systems (of design and development as well as testing and verification) for which legal guidance can be used to define permissible uncertainty.",Lisa Miracchi Titus,"ICRA Workshop on Addressing Ethical and Technical Challenges in the Development, Use and Governance of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems",5/27/22,https://ieeetv.ieee.org/channels/techethics/permissible-uncertainty-and-meaningful-human-control-laws-workshop-icra-2022,,,,Permissible Uncertainty and Meaningful Human Control

22917,FN-279530-21,"Linguistic studies of Michif (ISO 639-3: crg), a contact language spoken by members of the Métis Nation on the northern Great Plains, have frequently observed two distinct systems of nominal classification in the language—one based on French-derived gender (masculine- feminine), and another based on Algonquian-derived animacy (animate-inanimate) (Bakker 1997; Papen 2003). More recent research in this area has noted variability in both animacy and gender assignment, both within and among present-day Michif speakers (e.g., Gillon &amp; Rosen 2018, Papen 2003, Sammons 2019). While these recent studies draw valuable attention to the presence of such variability as a feature of contemporary Michif, it is not immediately clear from these synchronically oriented results to what extent variation in nominal classification should be understood as a relatively recent linguistic innovation, or if it may also be attested historically in Michif. To investigate this, this study draws upon noun classifications from a corpus of several thousand Michif language example sentences produced by first-language speakers in the context of community dictionary development during the 1970s and early 1980s (Laverdure &amp; Allard 1983). As one of the few extensive collections of Michif language from this time period, this source provides apparent- time information on patterns of Michif language use among speakers born one to two generations earlier than those represented in recent studies.  This study considers the scope of variability in gender and animacy assignment attested in this earlier Michif corpus as found in both native Michif lexemes and non-nativized borrowings from English, comparing these patterns against results reported in more recent studies. While not ruling out the possibility of greater present-day variability in noun classification as one result of more recent linguistic developments in the Michif language community, this work suggests that a degree of variation in Michif nominal",A diachronic view of Michif animacy and gender,"Annual meeting, Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas",01/22/23,https://www.ssila.org/2023-annual-meeting,"SSILA conference program, January 20–22, 2023",,,A diachronic view of Michif animacy and gender

22931,FT-279088-21,"This paper recounts the story of one particular Black European, a French citizen of Haitian descent named Jean Laraque, who circulated across French North Africa in the first part of the 20th century. Born in Paris to an elite Haitian family, Laraque was partially raised in Tunisia, completed his military service in Algeria, and briefly worked for a bank in Rabat, Morocco. Within three years of his arrival in Morocco, however, Laraque converted to Islam, moved to the Amazighophone Sous, married a local woman, and began working as a public writer who translated the complaints of disgruntled locals into the language of power: French.  While Laraque was certainly not the only Frenchman to ""go native,"" in this paper I argue that the stakes for him were radically different for the simple fact that he was Black. Specifically, in addition to being subject to French anti-Black racism as a Black Frenchman, I argue that Laraque's decision to live ""à l'arabe"" resulted in him accidentally ""passing"" for a Black Moroccan and thus being subject to Moroccan anti-Black racism as well.  To make this argument, I bring recent literature on race, racism, and Blackness in North Africa (Becker 2020, El Hamil 2012; Scaglioni 2020) into conversation with literature on Euro-Mediterranean mobility in Afro-Mediterranean spaces. In doing so, I hope to show that stories like that of Laraque are important not only for the sake of ""representation,"" but also because they provide us with a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, political, and, ultimately, racial(ized) Afro-Mediterranean landscapes in which all Euro-Mediterranean subjects were circulating–including those who were ""white.""",Kristin Gee Hickman,"Mediterranean Mobilities: Between Migrations and Colonialisms, XIX-XX centuries (University of Bologna)",11/11/22,,,,,A Black European in the Maghreb and the Racialized Stakes of 'Going Native'

Modern community-based lexicography, on the other hand, is generally team-based, cross-platform, dynamic and multimedia. Multimedia dictionaries are often developed as a component of projects on the documentation of language use within its cultural context, usually combined with judicious elicitation of missing lexical items and examples of their usage. However, to produce multimedia dictionaries, one has often needed to rely on either advanced computer programming skills or the use of a suite of software packages where it is time consuming to insert the data and difficult to get it out in a form that is usable for other aspects of research. This leads to the following question: how can we develop a workflow for community-based lexicography that can integrate materials from a variety of sources while still maintaining the integrity of the original data in way that is accessible to most linguists? In this talk, I show how to apply the data science principles of portability, transparency, modularity and version control to modern lexicography so that it can move beyond this labor-intensive or programming- intensive dichotomy.

A man called Abdelnour appeared before officials at the station, representing himself as a peddler merchant doing business with Syrian textile firms in New York and Mexico City.

As the first female-driven Avengers spin-off, the A-list actress who plays Natasha Romanoff in nine franchise installments has been integral to Disney's crown jewel, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Johansson claimed the new day-and-date strategy broke her original contractual agreement for an exclusive theatrical release and expectations of profit participation from global box office gross. Under the helm of new chairman Bob Chapek, Disney responded by dismissing the lawsuit as a ""callous disregard"" for the global pandemic in what feminist advocate groups criticized as a ""gendered character attack."" In rushing to restructure traditional distribution windows amidst the struggling pandemic theatrical business and to prop up the Disney+ streaming platform in lieu of maintaining talent relationships, who loses out?  Under increased scrutiny in the late 2010s for not hiring women to helm big budget tentpole projects, the Mouse House and peer studios slowly began to exploit existing IP as a way to develop female-directed and female-led projects. This paper examines how Disney's first significant slate of female-driven tentpoles—Mulan, Raya and the Last Dragon, Cruella, Black Widow—went from highly celebrated gender parity ""wins"" for female filmmakers to being sacrificed in the Covid era distribution shuffle to fuel Disney+ subscribers. First, I look at how Disney executives and talent responded in trade interviews and social media to widespread criticism about gender disparities behind the camera in 2018 and 2019. Second, based on personal interviews and trade press discourse, I consider how Disney's move away from traditional distribution windowing to a day-and-date theatrical and Disney+ Premium VOD releasing in 2020 impacted above-the-line female creatives of Mulan (2020, dir.

23401,RQ-279760-21,"A decorated scholar-practitioner with a lifetime of music and dance training in the traditions of his village and their national-level iterations in the Nepal Army, Subi Shah wrote this manuscript based on his own experience as a flute player. He did additional research with the sahanai players of the naumati baja of his home village, Jyamrung, in Dhading. Introduction to Nepali Tunes offers a theory of melodic modes based on the musical instruments bansuri, murali, and sahanai, and discusses the relation of vernacular traditions with those holding ""classical"" status, illustrating his music-theoretical and social-theoretical claims with two or three notated example songs for each mode, plus his own written commentary. We assert that these instruments take on the role of ""epistemic things"" (Rheinberger, 1997) not simply technical objects used to produce pre-conceived sounds, but the sensory, experiential basis for understanding melody. Our broader argument, building on those of multiple ethnomusicological studies on embodiment, is that theories are not only articulated verbally, and attention to the act of performance and its technical and sensory aspects are also a way to develop, determine, and transmit theories. Subi Shah's manuscript begins to translate this embodied musical theory into words and music notation. Our scholarship aims to carry its insights forward, explaining their relevance outside the case study of Shah's central Nepali musical traditions toward a more expansive concept of what constitutes theory, and a greater appreciation for the depth of knowledge found in the vernacular artistic traditions of Nepal. This in turn is important for these traditions' cultural sustainability and continued vitality.","Anna Stirr, Lochan Rijal, Mason Brown",Annual Conference on Nepal and the Himalaya,07/29/2022,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368685965 Embodied Theories of Melody in Nepali Music,Link to posted slides,10.13140/RG.2.2.12715.52003,DOI for slides,Embodied Theories of Melody in Nepali Music: A Case Study from Central Dhading
23412,FT-59041-11,"This paper examines two manuscripts belonging to two successive provosts of Sainte-Marie (Notre-Dame) of Reims, Odalric (fl. 1025-1075) and Manasses (1075/6-1096; later archbishop, 1096-1106). The manuscripts, currently Bibliothèque municipale de Reims Mss. 15 and 1402, both bear an ex libris clearly identifying their owners. BM Reims 15 contains a variety of texts, including the capitular necrology (10th-12th century), a tripartite Psalter, a farrago of canons, an episcopal list of Reims, and the earliest known copy (I do not believe it has been identified as such) of the Textus miraculi quod Dominus ad destructionem symoniacae heresis operari dignatus est in episcopatu Florentino (on Petrus Igneus and Bishop Petrus Mezzabarbo of Florence). Its contents, added at different times from ca. 1050-, indicate that BM Reims 15 was very much a ‘working' text, a sort of reference or archive for the provost and chapter. BM Reims 1402, belonging to Manasses, is more straightforward. A passionary (hyemalis secundus), its texts focus heavily on local bishop-saints (Archbishops Remigius, Rigobertus) and fathers of the church (Pope Gregory I, Pope Sylvester, Benedict). It further contains, inserted just before the vita of Pope Gregory, four of that pontiff's letters, apparently selected for their thematic significance and, I will argue, connection to reform ideas on clerical celibacy and simony. I will argue that their manuscripts reveal the means by which the seminal ideas of church reform concerning simony and priestly conduct were introduced into the powerful archdiocese of Reims. Collectively, they suggest the ‘indirect' and often piecemeal ways in which reformist ideas were transmitted—through textual exempla and canonical farragos—which adjusts our traditional view of reform as directly conveyed through intentional canonical collections or papal fiat. BM Reims 15 and 1402 give us a taste of what church reform ‘on the ground' looked like.",John S.

23433,FEL-281365-22,"This paper dissects audiences before Parisian justices of the peace to reveal how city dwellers overturned traditional power dynamics between lessors and lessees during the Revolution. Prior to the nineteenth century, principal tenants of urban ""houses"" (who were mostly artisans and shopkeepers) generally came from the same socioeconomic background as their subtenants (who were other artisans, small merchants, and laborers). Individuals who assumed the role of principal tenant, or the main tenant responsible for remitting all subtenants' rent to the building's owner, did so to gain spatial rather than economic advantages. Being a principal tenant offered an individual the first choice of living, working, and commercial spaces within a building. Principal tenants rarely expected to make money from subletting the remaining rooms. On the contrary, they faced significant risks and potential losses in collecting rent and state taxes from delinquent subtenants. However, following the invention of the revolutionary justices of the peace, principal tenants seized the new possibility to quickly and affordably bring contests over small sums like a single term's rent for the cheap rooms. The use and looming threat of this strategy appears to have truncated lessee's repayment windows for backrent, which was one of the most common and significant urban expenses. In effect, the justice of the peace instituted new boundaries between lessors and lessees in rental relationships and lessors deployed state institutions to gain a firm upper-hand for the first time. In the long run, lessors' newfound advantages made it possible to conceive of rental housing as a profitable investment and as arena of entrepreneurial activity in the nineteenth century.",Katie Jarvis,Society for French Historical Studies/ Western Society for French History Conference,3/17/23,,,,,"“Principal Tenants, Subtenants, and Revolutionary Justice: Recalibrating Economic Power in Rental Relationships”"

Emo's Wien 1910  Vienna 1900 is now a celebrated lieu de memoire, but in the Nazi Weltanschauung it was decadent, degenerate and verjudete. The history of fin de siècle Vienna needed to be erased and rewritten, its culture eradicated to assimilate it into the Ostmark. But there was a problem with dismissing the period entirely; it was during that time, and within that milieu, that one of Hitler's most beloved role models had risen to power. Ever eager to please his master, Josef Goebbels could think of no better subject for a film than Karl Lueger, mayor of Vienna from 1897 to 1910 and a figure deeply admired by Hitler. When a script appeared in 1940 for a film about Lueger and his contemporary, the pan-Germanist Georg von Schönerer, to be produced by Wien Film, Goebbels jumped at the chance; after passing through numerous script writers, the film, directed by E.M. Emo, passed the censors in August of 1942, and had its premiere in Vienna the following April. After that, it was never shown in Vienna again.  In what way were these figures distanced in the film from their deep roots in the turn of the century city? What efforts were made to salvage these important and celebrated Viennese figures while continuing to malign and excoriate the culture in which they had risen to prominence and held sway? What selling points and strategies were used to make Wien 1910 a time and place worthy of attention for the film, as its history was simultaneously being distorted and erased? A look at the materials and discourse around the film, including the original publicity kit and materials, will attempt to show how these figures were positioned and portrayed in the film and divorced from the city that had produced them.",Laura Morowitz,Austrian Studies Association Conference,2/1/23,,,,please note this will happen in April 2023 but it would not let me save that way,“The Nazi erasure of the fin de siècle city:From Vienna 1900 to E.M.

23439,FT-254173-17,"ABSTRACT During the last three decades Viennese 1900 has exploded in popular culture and academia: in countless exhibitions dedicated to painting, architecture, and the applied arts, in myriad books on every well-known Viennese designer, and in the ""Klimtomania"" that covers umbrellas, scarves and shopping bags. Yet the popularity of Viennese Modernism and thecommercial ""Vienna 1900"" industry simultaneously obscures a problematic series of historical erasures and gaps. All too often, the glittering culture of ""Vienna 1900"" is studied in isolation from the political exigencies of 1938 and thereafter. Our panel will interrogate the intentional neglect and repression of specific figures, organizations and movements who have faded in the shadow of larger Viennese superstars and a now familiar narrative, or who have been intentionally white-washed. The papers will call attention to some of the ""absences"" linked directly to the years of 1938-1945, to the ""de-Jewification"" of the Viennese street scape, to the careful art historical narrative surrounding certain careers, to the reshaping of a ""Vienna-in-Exile"" within the artistic establishment of post-war New York. In addition, we will show how the very celebration of Vienna 1900 cannot be understood apart from the uses to which it was put following the war, for it cannot be denied, and indeed is richly ironic, that the same period suppressed in Nazi discourse has been used to suppress Austria's turbulent Nazi past.","Laura Morowitz and Megan Brandow-Faller, Panel Chairs",College Art Association,2/17/23,,,,,Vienna 1900/Vienna 1938
23440,FT-254173-17,"Erasing the City:The 1939 ""Berge und Menschen der Ostmark"" Exhibit  In March of 1939, one year after the Anschluss, the Vienna Künstlerhaus opened their doors to the enormous exhibit, Berge und Menschen der Ostmark. Filled with nearly 900 works by 238 contemporary artists, the show functioned to celebrate the rural Gaue, or regions, of former Austria. Paintings, prints, drawings, and sculptures depicted the landscape of Ostmark--and in particular its Alpine mountains--as well as its peasants, in every mood, from the banal to the sublime. Some works showed empty, meditative landscapes, while many focused on the peasant at work in the land: logging, harvesting, planting, tilling, ploughing and building. In its later manifestation in Berlin, the exhibit included an array of folk crafts, industrial products and even regional food specialities.  Although the origin of the show dated back to the period of Austro-Fascism, it took on a new urgency and message with the annexation of Austria into the Third Reich. The exhibit presented Ostmark as the ""treasure-chest of the Reich"" with its waterways, natural resources and farmland. It expressed, in powerful images of golden fields and soaring, snow-capped mountains, the idea of the Heimat. With its countless images of hearty farmers and braided blonde mädchen it also gave visual form to the concept of the Volksgemeinschaft.   In this paper, I argue that the show also served to erase the city. Reflecting the Blut und Boden myth of National Socialism, the hundreds of works on display elevated the rural and the regional. Yet the Berge und Menschen theme was not only anti-urban in a more general sense but also aimed to displace Vienna, capital of a multicultural Empire, as the heart of the Ostmark. Cosmopolitan and entjudete Vienna was all but ignored in the imagery, aside from its older cultural achievements.

The show was sponsored by Baldur von Schirach, Reichstatthalter of Vienna and former leader of the Hitlerjugender.. For Schirach, the show was yet another opportunity to proclaim Vienna as the cultural capital of the Third Reich, against the firect opposition of Joser Goebbals.In contrast to the peasant mother or uniformed madchen, Viennase women would be presented as glamoroius and , charming, playing directly on Vienna's history of portraiture and her reputation for flair and gemultichkeit.  The prganizers of the show adopted many  strategies to elevate Vienna's cultural achievement and her famed beauties. One was by linking the exhibit to earlier shows and contests of that nature in 1928 and 1930?? Another was to reference the tradition of Austrian biedermeier portraits, not coincidentally beloved by Adoplf Hitler.. Yet another strategy , the focus of my paper, was specifically to focus on Vienna as a fashion capital of Europe. This played directly to Balder von Schirach's  interest, as he repeatedly aimed to establish Vienna as a city to rival Paris. The show linked to this trope of Vienna while  counterpoising the uniformed madchen and peasant mother to the more charming Viennese beauty. Sheserved as a foil not only to the more pracical GErman hausfrau, but also to the Neue Fraue, who had claimed the fashion spotlight in the decade earlier.   It was impossible, however, to mount such an exhibition without evoking the missing Jewess, who had dominated not only fashion, but Viennse. By 1942 her image had been laregly erased, just as the women themselves had been deported and the city made largely judenfrei. I will argue, however, that the absent presence of the Jewss continued to haunt the 1942 exhibition.",Laura Morowitz,Austrian Studies Association,4/13/2019,,,,,"“The schöne Wienerin, the Deutsche mädchen, and the absent Jewess: portraiture and cultural politics in Nazi Vienna”"

11936,HD-51352-11,"The May 1982 AAAS magazine Science boasted Joseph Menosky's cover story ""Capturing the Evanescent Art: Choreography by Computer"" highlighting efforts of computer scientists, dance researchers, and notators who developed programs to digitally record movement. The 1980s then saw the advent of LabanWriter, Labanotation-writing desktop software that streamlined the process of producing and reproducing Labanotation scores and replaced hand-written notation calligraphies. These developments in computer technology opened possibilities for how Labanotation and motion capture systems could potentially generate movement documents. This paper poses questions about what digital technology and Labanotation continue to do for each other as documentary record and generative function by thinking through the implications of KineScribe, a Labanotation iPad app (2013) that expands the usability of digitized Labanotation scores at the point of a touchscreen interface: literally, at the tip of a finger. As we think broadly about inscribing in an age of ephemeral documentation media, the formats for which slide into obsolescence as technologies change, I suggest that we tend to this digital mode of transmission by asking the following: What does digital humanities teach us about dance notation and embodiment with digital technology as the way through which? How can this technology retain a presence of the dancing bodies that once generated the movement, to prevent their absence in the historical record? I argue that shifts in Labanotation technologies necessitate broader changes with how we enact dances of this written record, and that the plasticity of digital technology supports Labanotation's endurance in dance studies.",Hannah Kosstrin,Congress on Research in Dance and Society of Dance History Scholars,11/15/2014,,,,,Plasticity through Digital Inscription: Labanotation and Digital Media

Through a series of faculty development workshops and seminars, 7 Hinds faculty members worked together to create and deliver the course content. &#x0D; &#x0D; In this session, we will discuss lessons learned from this adventure in team teaching, as well as suggestions for other community colleges who might want to adopt a similar approach.

11973,AB-234469-16,"In an effort to increase student engagement with the humanities on campus, Hinds Community College-Utica, an HBCU in rural Mississippi, launched a new course centered around the founding of our institution. Introduction to the Humanities is a team-taught course offered by the humanities faculty where each instructor delivered a different 2-3 week unit. The students were engaged in a study of Black rural education in the context of the Jim Crow south though a careful reading of Black Man's Burden, the autobiography of our founder, William H. Holtzclaw. Funded through a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the course has allowed our small campus the opportunity to investigate Holtzclaw's life and legacy through both faculty research and students' undergraduate research projects. In this session, we will discuss lessons learned from this experience for colleges who may wish to explore institutional history with their own students.

Within Digital Mitford: The Mary Russell Mitford Archive, the challenge of locating the mysterious ""Miss James"" proves emblematic. Referenced solely by patronym, ""Miss James"" became a topic of conjecture when multiple editors shared questions about the same elusive figure. In letters penned by Mitford in 1819 and after, ""Miss James"" emerged as Mary Mitford's trusted friend and advisor. She was also an opinionated humorist, offering assessments of everything from mutual acquaintances to literary works. Yet while her Christian name and profession were later discovered by project editors, her history remains largely unearthed.&#x0D; &#x0D; What insights might processing Digital Mitford's own markup reveal about such a figure? Inspired by Douglas Duhaime's visualized co-citations in the EEBO-TCP corpus, we view clusters of related data as forms of annotation—ones that, rendered judiciously, aid both scholars and those newer to Mitford's oeuvre. Working with XQuery on our eXist database of project files, we first assess the prevalence of relational categories tagged by our editors, then use these counts to weight lists of high-frequency tokens in ranges indexed by a key term.

12027,FZ-231436-15,"In the fall of 1869, two teams of lawyers squared off over whether the Cincinnati school board had the power to end a thirty-year tradition: Bible reading at the start of the school day. The battle became a national controversy in which the press across the country took sides. Throughout the Bible War, as it came to be called, supporters of the Bible in the schools pointed to clause in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, repeated in the Ohio Constitutions of 1802 and 1851: ""Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."" This powerful idea—that schools, religion, and the state rise and fall together—drew directly on the traditions of New England from where the men of the Ohio Company of Associates came. They asked the federal government to donate a section of land in each township for the support of schools and another for the support of a minister—a request that astonished and annoyed James Madison of Virginia. Yet the Ohio Company succeeded in gaining both provisions from the US Treasury. The early advocates of public schools in Ohio overwhelmingly pious Protestant and often ministers also shared in this idea. The story of the Northwest Ordinance and its legacy shows us how Americans first argued over religion's place in the Republic, how rival church-state traditions lived on in new states, and then shaped the rise of new state institutions.",Linda Przybyszewski,Rights and Wrongs: A Constitutional Day Conference at San Francisco State University,09/15/2016,,,,,Competing Constitutional Traditions on Church and State: The Northwest Ordinance and the Cincinnati Bible War

As these notations often indicate who donated recipes to the household and as particular dishes such as ""seviche"" and ""Spanish Bacon"" specify recipe and ingredient location, MS 7113 hints at both the social networks within which the Fanshawes operated as well as the way English households engaged with foreign cookery and medicine.  &#x0D; &#x0D; This presentation will trace intersections between Lady Anne's travels and recipe collecting habits while also demonstrating how today's collaborative methods are bringing to light the networks that created early modern manuscript recipe collections.

It is my contention, however, that grouping the dialogues with the drama and subjecting both to a principal component analysis enables us to observe the precise linguistic features that have seemed so ""theatrical"" to critics. Indeed, this approach renders visible several overlapping characteristics of the language in comedie (particularly ""city comedies"") and the language in Florio, Hollyband, and Stepney's manuals.

It argues that statistics are a crucial piece of the assemblage of human and non-human things involved in the large-scale transformation of institutions in Turkey in line with EU norms and standards, and that this work of reforming of institutions, practices and ultimately livelihoods is often undertaken in the name of technical adjustments merely to collect better data. Hence through the study of changes in Turkey's collection and use of statistics we are in a position to examine the processes through which collectivities in Turkey are made commensurable with those in the EU. By looking at the case of agriculture and agriculture statistics I show how it is through the reform of statistics along EU standards that a lot of the ‘work' of engineering commensurability of social forms is accomplished. Finally, I suggest that what this means is that the work of reform is done through the reform of statistics at least as much as, if not more than, through more explicitly deliberative mechanisms, which points to the technopolitical nature of reform itself.",Brian Silverstein,"Ohio State University, Departments of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, Anthropology, and Centers for Middle Eastern Studies and Folklore",02/03/2017,https://mesc.osu.edu/events/brian-silverstein,"Ohio State University, Middle Eastern Studies Center event announcement",,,Technologies of Commensuration: Performativity and the Reform of Statistics in Turkey

Scientific workflows provide a structured methodology for standardized replication and testing of state-of-the-art models, open publication of datasets and software together, and ease of analysis by re-using pre-existing components. In this paper, we present initial work in developing a framework that will allow reuse and extension of many computer vision methods, as well as allowing easy reproducibility of analytical results, by publishing dadasets and workflows packaged together as linked data. Our approach uses the WINGS semantic workflow system which validates semantic constraints of the computer vision algorithms, making it easy for non-experts to correctly apply state-of-the-art image processing methods to their data. We show the ease of use of semantic workflows for reproducibility in computer vision by both utilizing pre-developed workflow fragments and developing novel computer vision workflow fragments for a video activity recognition task, analysis of multimedia web content, and the analysis of artistic style in paintings using convolutional neural networks.","Ricky J.

And he tells us that in order to establish this we need gapless proofs of the basic truths of arithmetic from logical laws.  But are the basic Begriffsschrift laws – the laws from which he attempts to prove truth of arithmetic – laws of logic? Frege himself expressed doubt about Basic Law V, even in the preface to volume i of Grundgesetze.  Why, then, did Frege think it was a logical law and what did he think he needed to do to convince his readers of this?  Richard Heck thinks the answer is obvious: Frege thought that he had a semantic proof of Basic Law V and he expected this proof to convince his readers that it was a logical law.  In his recent book, Reading Frege's Grundgesetze, Heck argues for this view and attempts to explain the semantic proof. I shall argue that Heck is mistaken. Frege does not give a semantic proof of Basic Law V.  Indeed, Heck's assumption – that a semantic proof can show us that a basic law belongs to logic – is incompatible with Frege's explicit statements.

With the annexation of this territory, the Reich gained more than material treasures and a landscape of family pleasures. The Ostmark became the final frontier, the last stronghold against the human and racial ""pollution"" that lay beyond its border. The former Austria was no longer  a gateway to Eastern Europe, but rather its barricade. Despite the term Ostmark, the regions of former Austria were not liminal places between two cultures, but the last stretches of the ""not East"".  The transformation of Austria into the Ostmark--or rather its ""reversion"", according to Nazi history-- back to the eastern-most part of the German Reich was accompanied by a flurry  of publications including history books, exhibition catalogues, tourist brochures and popular journals. The notion of  Ostmark als Bolwerke forms a leitmotif throughout both  ""scholarly"" and popular texts.The famed mountains of Carinthia, Styria and Burgenland were hailed as the natural walls preserving the racial purity and Aryan blood of the Germanic populations.  In contrast to the rural, mountainous regions, standing as guardians against the encroach of the slavs, the city of Vienna could not into fit easily into this narrative. It was not only situated at the eastern reaches of the Ostmark, but in Nazi ideology--and certainly in the view of Adolf Hitler-- the city had been poisoned by its proximity to the East. As is well known, in Mein Kampf Hitler described his first encounter with a turbaned Ostjuden on the streets of Vienna. As the seat of the Hapsburg Empire,  but also as the most ""Eastern"" of Austrian cities, Vienna remained suspect throughout the years of the Third Reich.

23577,FT-278594-21,"Live and dead animals played complex roles at Mycenae, Greece during the Late Bronze Age. Archaeological remains of non-human animal bodies provide insights into how they were treated as sources of food, raw materials, symbolism, and how they lived as active companions and members of past societies. Abundant animal remains were recovered from Petsas House, a residence used for ceramic production and storage at Mycenae. They were found with an array of materials, including ceramic vessels and architectural debris in a well deposit, which likely formed shortly following a destructive earthquake. Previous analysis of the well fauna, dating to the LH III A2 period (14th c. BCE), revealed abundant livestock remains, including young pigs that point to some local pig management. This paper will utilize zooarchaeological analysis to delve into the domesticated animal populations that were raised, culled, used, and deposited in the extra-palatial well context. We focus on the demography and body-part representation of pigs and caprines (sheep and goats). The results are compared to the taphonomic history of the deposit to better relate the evidence of past animal management to animal use by the artisan residents.  Notably, we detected structured culling and variable carcass completeness for the pigs, sheep, and goats. This reflects some general access to locally managed and butchered populations and more specific indirect access to select parts of sheep likely produced for wool. These results are used to decenter the picture of Mycenaean animal use, commonly based on Linear B textual evidence of palatial interests in sheep. Ultimately, our findings reflect how a single household of artisans had different levels of direct and indirect engagement with specific taxa. This provides new insights into human-animal boundaries across different social realms of Mycenae.","Jacqueline Meier, Gypsy Price, Kim Shelton","Archaeological Institute of America Annual Meeting, 2022",1/6/2022,,,,,"Artisan-animal interactions at Petsas House, Mycenae"
23578,FT-278594-21,"Schliemann's unprecedented excavations at Mycenae paved the way for almost 150 years of archaeological investigations focused on the elite people that have come to exemplify the site in the Late Bronze Age. While Schliemann's campaigns focused on elite burials ""rich in gold"", most of the ecofacts ""rich in data"" were overlooked in the early days of archaeology at the site. This includes the archaeological remains of animals from Mycenae that reflect ubiquitous and versatile faunal resources. As the consumption of faunal resources transcends political and social hierarchies, animals served as wealth on the hoof and permeated most aspects of past social life. Animals were not absent from early Mycenaean narratives; yet, animal roles were largely based on imagery/iconography which reflected not only elite lives, but idealized elite experiences and relationships with the natural world. For example, interpretations of the iconic stag hunt signet ring from shaft grave IV and boars tusk helmets are associated with wild animal hunting for status and power. In more recent research of animals at Mycenae and throughout the Mycenaean world, the focus has shifted to studies of feasting on meaty animal parts. However, animal remains preserve even more detailed information about Mycenaean subsistence practice and how it relates to social inequality, economic change, and human-environmental interactions.    Here, we present findings from our ongoing faunal study of Petsas House, Mycenae, with a focus on cattle. We discuss several advances in faunal research that have furthered the wider narrative of subsistence practice at the site, including recent isotopic and spatial analysis. Context-based analysis of the faunal refuse from this industrial-domestic complex provides new insights into the lived experiences of fauna down to the individual level.

Although it was first introduced in 1824, soon after the French recaptured Senegal in 1817, concerns for capital punishment and capital crimes emerged in Senegal as early as the 1780s, a time of booming French trade in the region. Yet, capital punishment was not fully enforced until 1899 when took place in Saint-Louis, the colony's administrative capital, the first public guillotine execution. A defining moment in the history of punishment in Senegal, this first execution charts the ways in which capital punishment had evolved in Senegal but also the complexities inherent in its practice.  This paper examines the historical context of the introduction, evolution, and transformation of capital punishment in Senegal with special attention to the legislation and politics of the death penalty. Its main objective is to analyze its impact on the development of the colonial state by showing how it was conceptualized and contextualized. This paper asks: How did capital punishment fit into the larger project of colonial repression in Senegal? How, why, and when, it did become institutionalized as a form of punishment?

Anderson and Won-ho Park Abstract  This paper grows out of a larger project on democratic decline in Nicaragua.   That project examines the gradual breakdown of Nicaragua's democracy between 2006 and today.  During that time, Nicaragua moved from being a developing democracy to becoming a hybrid regime to being a fully authoritarian regime.  The project shows how democracy declined in Nicaragua, owing largely to gradual power aggrandizement by Daniel Ortega.  Ortega won the 2006 election, the nation's last free election.  National elections since then have been increasingly fraudulent.  Citizens initially acquiesced in Ortega's non-constitutional accumulation of power because of generous social programs that he provided, funded by Venezuela. Citizen support for Ortega changed in April 2018, when Nicaragua's population exploded in protest against him.  The protesters initially called only for the reinstatement of social security benefits, which Ortega had cancelled.  However, his brutal repression of the protesters caused them to demand his ouster.  The protests crashed the economy and attracted international attention but failed to oust Ortega.   This paper uses public opinion data to scrutinize the extent of opposition to the Ortega regime.  We examine citizen involvement in the protests but find protest participation to be only the tip of the iceberg; opposition runs much deeper.  We then compare citizen support for open street protest with two additional forms of resistance:  1) something that we call soft protest and 2) support for a national dialogue to remove Ortega under negotiated circumstances.  Soft protest is more organized and effective than everyday resistance  but less dangerous than street protest in a repressive setting.  Support for the national dialogue is an attitude rather than an act of resistance and uncovers further the depth of passive, cautious opposition to O","Leslie E.

This paper takes up the recent revival of interest in ancient epistolary fiction to consider the question: Can the letters of Ignatius be read as a work of fiction? What signs might suggest fictionality to us? (Would they suggest the same to ancient readers?) In order to gain traction on these questions, I closely analyze the correspondence between Ignatius of Mary of Cassabola which opens the so-called ""Long Recension"" of the collection. I argue that the Long Recension has a clear narrative arc and erotic undertones familiar from the ancient novels.

23699,FT-269888-20,"How do we remember the American Revolution? Many of the ways in which memory is preserved is predicated on privilege. Loyalty oaths, which officially declared whether someone was a loyalist or a patriot, were only (initially) administered to white, property-owning men. State assemblies invited neither women nor free black nor formerly enslaved people to participate in such discussions. Even the British, who offered Black Americans freedom in exchange for their loyalty, did so mostly to encourage the collapse of the Southern economy, so dependent upon slave labor. Thus, finding Black-authored Revolutionary-era texts is complicated by archives that privileged white statesmen over black writers and speakers who were denied a voice during the war. Work that has been done on blackness during the American Revolution has focused largely on recovery or slave rebellions. Phillis Wheatley excepted, scholarship about black-authored texts during the war remains woefully thin.  This panel attempts to address that scholarly ellipsis. It synthesizes recent research about early American Black print culture with recovery work done on Black loyalists and rebel writers to suggest new ways in which we might understand Blackness and Black-authored texts during this period. Particularly, it offers methodologies through which we might read Black poetry; sentimental fiction; muster rolls; legal documents; transatlantic letters and diaries; white-authored petitions quoting Black writers; and migration passes.

This panel will present two digital projects that fuse traditional modes of study of the period (philology, paleography, art history) with applications of virtual reality, data mining, digital measurement and other tools. Such projects rely on several kinds of hybridity. From cross-disciplinary co-creation to multi-media delivery, they offer new pathways not only for preservation and access regarding archival and rare bibliographic materials, but also hybrid spaces for scholarly collaboration and teaching. Far from alienating or ""diluting"" traditional resources, digital tools convey the multi-sensory complexity of Renaissance artifacts and spaces, and, at their best, offer immersive, interactive experiences that recapture the scale, detail, cognitive density, and aesthetic specificity of historical resources that are often not accessible to the general public. IDEA: Isabella d'Este Archive features archival document visualization, immersive virtual reality, art history and economic history, and bibliographic data in a set of interlocking and increasingly interactive projects led by a team of specialists from around the world. The Bibliotheca Iulia Instaurata (BI2) brings together book historians, classicists, art historians and interactive media artists to offer a chance to experience selected books from Pope Julius II's private library amid Raphael's frescoes in the Stanza della Segnatura, the intended setting for these precious manuscripts.","Deanna Shemek, Lisa Pon",Hybridity - The California Interdisciplinary Institute of Italian Studies,02/25/2023,https://cla.csulb.edu/event/hybridity-the-california-interdisciplinary-consortium-of-italian-studies/,,,,Hybrid Scholars for Hybrid Histories: Virtual Reality and the Italian Renaissance
23724,HAA-277236-21,"We have built a digital exploration of the early sixteenth-century private library of Pope Julius II, that we, using the vocabulary of the Renaissance humanists he admired, call the Bibliotheca Iulia instaurata, or the Julian Library renewed. Julius' library was a veritable Renaissance system of knowledge akin to today's hyperlinked information networks, which anticipated the concept of hyperlinks by establishing rich spatial references connecting different parts of the room, frescoes, books and furniture pieces to build a discursive space for knowledge.  Julius II's private library was housed in the Vatican Palace room painted by Raphael between 1509 and 1511 for Julius, now known as the Stanza della Segnatura. The main frescoes depict gatherings of thinkers from Greek antiquity to Julius' own time, from Homer and Plato to Gregory the Great and Raphael himself. The frescoes' themes—Philosophy, Poetry, Theology, and Jurisprudence—pictorially synthesize relationships between these four major disciplines from the period, and Julius collected books in all of them. Almost two hundred of Julius' books survive today, and Raphael's frescoes refer almost recursively to them, their authors, and their diverse fields of study.  The digital environment we have made allows visitors to explore how Julius and Raphael--major figures in the Renaissance-- used pictures, texts, and material artifacts to build a space for learning about their world. Our project aims to make the conceptual system linking these materials accessible and relevant for a contemporary audience and to create a digital version of the Renaissance system of knowledge it manifests. Our approach combines the study of books and paintings that have most often been studied separately, despite the historical fact that early visitors encountered the two together.

But in a larger sense, the articulated an intellectual and historical argument against settler colonialism and dispossession through a lens of British constitutionalism and history. Through these works, these authors developed legal strategies and arguments based on those readings and, in some cases, took their arguments and claims all the way to the top of the imperial hierarchy.

While the plight of massively overloaded and unseaworthy boats of people justifiably receives the media attention, there is a less documented movement that occurs and has occurred for thousands of years: small boats expertly transporting handfuls of people back and forth across the Channel between Tunisia and western Sicily. Material traces of these border crossings share some features with the migrant material culture strewn along the border zone of the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. These include migrants' strategic triangulation of speed, invisibility and survival in deciding what to bring and the tactical triage of gear en route. Further, the political and economic injustices that are catalysts for the movements are comparable, as is the criminalization of the migrants which has done more to endanger than dissuade them. However the exigencies of sea crossing require a distinct set of material culture and technologies of mobility, shedding new light on migrant choices and challenges. This paper explores the material vestiges of these cross-Channel migrations through assemblages identified during fieldwork along the southwest coast of Sicily in Summer 2018.","R. Giglio, E.

The survey zone consists of a 44 km2 strip between the cities of Marsala and Mazara del Vallo. In this season of fieldwork, we focused on the southern 20% of the zone. Our team identified three clusters dating to the Hellenistic and Roman periods, dispersed medieval and early modern artifacts, and even contemporary migrant material culture. More broadly speaking, scant artifacts from antiquity in the coastal zone and more abundant finds further inland are in surprising contrast to artifact distributions a few kilometers north, where our previous work records a distinct decline in artifact numbers inland compared to an intensively used coastal plain.  Archival  research  indicates  that  this  southern  region  of  the  survey,  prior  to  land  reclamation  projects  of  the  early  20th  century,  experienced  fluctuating  marshy conditions. Future work will determine if this pattern continues elsewhere in our survey zone.","S. Uzzle, E. Blake, R. Schon, R. Giglio, V. Moses, A.

But in a number of different ways, he was a highly unusual candidate for this scholarly distinction.  A relatively poor Yiddish-speaking immigrant who spent a year in prison before ever attending college, Tannenbaum displayed little interest in Latin America during his early years of engagement with the world of scholarship.  His first three books had nothing to do with Latin America, and his first two proposals for a dissertation in Economics (not History) were focused on crime and labor relations.  How then did Tannenbaum end up becoming a leading historian of Latin America?  I argue here that his fascination with the Mexican Revolution, the appeal of a less racially stratified society, and his personal experience working as a correspondent in Mexico City during the 1920s served to shift his interest in a Latin American direction.  Finally, the unexpected opportunity to join the Columbia history faculty consolidated his identity as a historian of Latin America but did not erase his interest in other fields.",Barbara Weinstein,American Historical Association meetings/Conference on Latin American History,01/08/2023,,,,,How to Become a Historian of Latin America: The Extraordinary Career of Frank Tannenbaum

However, with appropriate context and tools, today's students can and should appreciate these texts for what they are - classic stories that are just as relevant today as when they were composed in the ancient world. Our panel will center around veteran issues, many of which have remained essentially the same for thousands of years. For the previous six years, we have been working on three National Endowment for the Humanities grants that address veteran issues. Our approach is based on showing the continuity of veteran experience as depicted in ancient texts. In particular, we focus on ancient tragedy, following the work of psychiatrist Jonathan Shay who has argued that Athenian tragedy was a form of communal therapy for, of, and by veterans. In two Dialogues on the Experience of War grants, and one K-12 Summer Institute grant, we have led students, our college faculty colleagues, and teachers through sources, methods, and the academic rationale for our approach. We have sought to facilitate dialogue between veterans, but also have found great benefit by reaching out to veteran dependents, and to bringing civilians into dialogue with veterans. In addition to showing the continuity of experiences of war, we have had success in creating awareness of veteran issues. All of our work has emphasized the practical application of the Classics and the humanities and arts in general to effect positive personal change and wider community understanding of highly relevant issues that have remained constant throughout history.

We expand upon the theories of Aristotle and Shay, incorporating the work of other scholars, and adding new observations and arguments. In short, we consider the important similarities between tragic festivals and the Eleusinian Mysteries, Hippocratic medicine, and the Ascelipius cult. There is overlapping or shared vocabulary in some instances  (Jouanna and van der. Eijk), similar practices, and other remarkable parallels that reveal a great deal about Greek thought and practices regarding the healing of the psyche, as well as their beliefs about the connection between the mind and body. For example, we discuss Karlisa Hartigan's claim that there was a dramatic pageant performed for patients as part of the ritual enacted at the ancient Asclepieia that assists in the healing process ""to prepare the patients to receive the dreams sent by the god"" (29). Hartigan's idea, coupled with the fact that Ascelpian sanctuaries are located adjacent to theaters across the Greek world, suggests that the Greeks thought of both theaters and these sanctuaries as places of healing, and that performance was a crucial aspect shared by both. We also address the use of wine as a ""medicine"" (Jouanna and van der. Eijk), performance at Eleusis, and the strong possibility of the use of psychedelics among the Greeks (Wasson et al.; Muraresku); we argue, in light of recent medical research, that the use of psychedelics was serving as a treatment for mental health issues. Most importantly, we describe how many Greek medical and ritual practices are very well supported by modern psychological and medical research on the treatment of trauma.",Sean Lake,The Classical Association of the Atlantic States,10/08/2022,http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://caas-cw.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CAAS-Program.09.29.22.pdf,,,,"Wine as a Medicine for Grief: Performance, Psychedelics, Trauma, and Tragedy"

Harper's work—poetry praising Margaret Garner, essays challenging readers to aid fugitive slaves, and fiction connecting a seventeenth-century Brazilian quilombo to the black convention movement and free black parlors—was often retrospective, stories about the past crafted to link domestic pedagogy to radical practices.

Wilson's serial sketches published in the Anglo-African Magazine (1859-1860) represent an experience of being on the verge—of hope, despair, and revolution.  The form—fragmented, contingent, yet linear—propelled readers to the next installment, while Harper and Wilson's narratives concerning history, the sectional crisis, and revolt review a disjunctive past imbricated and sometimes simultaneous with the ""future that is before us.""  Harper's ""Fancy Sketches"" and ""Triumph of Freedom"" overlay hemispheric great time with the immediacy of antebellum freedom struggles, as characters read the history of Quilombo dos Palmares (a seventeenth century Brazilian maroon republic) and dream of David Walker's activism and John Brown's raid as both myth and prophesy.  Wilson's ""Ethiop"" translates an ""ancient"" tablet from the year 4000 telling of the destruction of the ""Amecans,"" a long gone ""milk white race."" The text links temporality to form, as Ethiop wonders if the tablet is ""fiction…history…or prophecy.""  These acts of reading (and authoring) suggest that for Wilson and Harper pinpointing one form and one temporality isn't as important as indeterminacy's unsettling effects:  the ""Agitation"" it produces and the futures it makes thinkable.  Their textual encounters frame time as a tangle of future histories, a revolution ongoing and yet-to-come.",Derrick R.

12229,FA-233427-16,"This paper asks how the literature of citizenship and revolution looked for those who simultaneously celebrated a new relation to the state, but who also recognized the persistence of white supremacy, both North and South. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper's revisions of pre-War poems and sketches after the Civil War to register the sense that while the War's final outcome and the subsequent Reconstruction amendments were a victory of sorts, revolution was an ongoing process of deconstruction and reconstruction that does not repeat events in the antebellum north, but does ""rhyme"" with them. Even as poems like the ""Aunt Chloe"" cycle narrate transitions from enslavement to freedom, freedom to citizenship, and citizenship to voting, they also highlight the tensions between a franchise predicated on manhood, southern politicians' efforts to reassert their authority by violence and bribery, and the work of ""women radicals"" like Chloe on the ground. Harper's revisions to poems like ""Truth,"" similar to the reconstruction amendments, suggest progress, but also reveal an interlocking and simultaneous set of experiments for which Harper and others could only, in the moment, offer sketches or outlines that were simultaneously descriptive of the narrative ""now,"" proleptic, and at the same time framed through generic conventions developed over the past two decades. The contiguities and tensions between Harper's pre-War work, then, direct us to question not only the forms literature and citizenship took during black reconstructions, but also how form and content registered the indeterminate and vexed nature of reconstruction itself.",Derrick R.

12253,HD-51222-11,"This paper will argue that the relationship between sacred and secular in the early seventeenth century played out in a complex and interactive relationship staged by the conduct of public worship and in the interactive character of preaching as quasi-theatrical events in specific locales and occasions. Donne's role in worship took place on occasions enabled by the Book of Common Prayer; his preaching, which he sometimes opposed rhetorically to the theater, shared with the theater a wide range of audience expectations for the use of costumes, clearly-defined stages, and active engagement with the assembled congregation. This transformation of worship played out in spaces which were themselves engaged in contested relationships between sacred and secular. Our digital models of St Paul's Cathedral and Paul's Churchyard (vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu) foreground the complexities of these interactions during Donne's time as Dean of the cathedral. The cathedral's nave ceased being the site of festival processions or the site of chancery chapels where masses were said for the dead, becoming instead Paul's Walk, the notorious site where the fashionable came to gossip and lawyers, prostitutes, and pickpockets plied their trades, interrupting the round of daily offices that continued to be sung in the cathedral's Choir. In Paul's Churchyard, the sacred world of cloisters and charnel houses gave way to a complex mix of sacred and secular; Paul's Churchyard functioned both as a working graveyard and an increasingly commercial area where the proliferation of bookshops made Paul's Churchyard into the commercial center of the English book trade. So formerly sacred spaces could shelter community and commercial activities while regaining a sense of a transformed sacred space through public ceremonies and occasions like the Paul's Cross sermons, which while theologically instructive were also the most entertainment one could find in London for free on a Sunday morning.",John N.

12254,AQ-229068-15,"Following recent studies on global approaches to the humanities, this paper details the development of a first-year seminar designed to investigate the divide between Western and non-Western traditions in art history. It explores a plurality of approaches to the enduring question, what is the significance of art to humanity? Thematic and object-driven, it engages a comparative perspective on the role of art in diverse cultures throughout history. Primary source readings extend across disciplines to encourage critical debate, and team-based projects offer avenues for adapting this model to larger classroom settings. This paper examines how the design and experience of teaching a global seminar at the undergraduate level not only extends beyond the bounds of any art historical specialty, but also tests the methods and pedagogical practices standard in our discipline today. At the foundational level, this course aims to mediate the west/non-west divide and inspire a global conversation in our classrooms.",Kristen Chiem,Annual Meeting of the College Art Association,2/5/2016,,,,,“Mediating the West/Non-West Divide: What is the Significance of Art to Humanity?”
12280,AQ-234985-16,"Plato postulated that the human body partakes from a lower material order characterized by change and decay (the order of becoming) and that the soul belongs to a higher and unchanging eternal order (the order of being), a proposition that set in motion a millennial concern with questions about body and soul, and with attendant theories and beliefs about mortality/immortality, materialism/idealism, sacred/profane, being/becoming, etc. Arguably all canonical schools have grappled with body/soul or body/mind questions, including Christianity, Idealism, Materialism, Romanticism, Rationalism, Phenomenology, or indeed Third Wave Feminism. Beyond philosophy and theology, these themes have also marked the arts, literature, and poetry, and canonical artists and writers have provided their own footnotes to Platonic dualism. This paper traces the genealogy of these debates about body and soul and discusses the extent to which an evolving body/soul rhetoric marked the development of the humanities in the West.",Rafael F.

12400,FB-56857-13,"After Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, hundreds of African North Americans returned to fight for the U.S. Army, and thousands more returned to the United States in the decades that followed. At the same time, hundreds of men, women, and children traveled north to Canada, even after emancipation. Time in Canada gave African North Americans the power of comparison: When struggling for access to social and political participation and economic opportunity in the United States, these individuals had a reference point in British North America (Canada), a similar but distinct Anglo-American society with a different history of slavery, emancipation, and claims for equal rights. This paper places African North American political actions, economic choices, and cultural arguments within a transnational context, providing a new understanding of the source of political and cultural currents in U.S. history from the beginnings of the Underground Railroad to the death of the emancipation generation (roughly 1830-1920), expanding the geographic scope of Reconstruction and of African American history northward. It outlines the importance of the idea as well as the reality of Canada for these African North Americans, and then considers why the aftermath of the well-known Underground Railroad history has received so little attention.",Adam Arenson,Western History Association,10/22/2016,https://westernhistoryassociation.wildapricot.org/resources/Pictures/SEPT%2022%20FINAL%20VERSION%20OF%20ST%20PAUL%20PROGRAM.pdf,program from conference,,,"Crossing the Border after the Underground Railroad: The Emancipation African North Americans in the United States and Canada, 1860s-1930s"

12450,FA-57408-13,"This paper identifies the immediate sources from which Duns Scotus constructed his own, much discussed version of Anselm of Canterbury's theory of the two affections of the will. I show that Scotus developed his theory not directly from Anselm but from the late-thirteenth-century debates at Paris over free will and, in particular, from Henry of Ghent's lengthy, critical analysis of Anselm's doctrine. The immediate occasion for Henry's extensive analysis of Anselm's two affections was the specific solution to the free will problem advanced by the Franciscan John of Murro, who attempted to merge Anselm with Aquinas's resolution based on his innovative distinction between the exercise and specification of an act. Henry rejected Murro's interpretation of Aquinas, just as he had forcefully rejected Aquinas's original solution, but did so only after a treatise length commentary on Anselm. It was from Henry's analysis of Anselm, the first and most substantial in the scholastic period, that Scotus's took his own theory of the two affections, including his controversial claim that the affection for justice is the ""native freedom of the will.""

12429,HT-50092-14,"How might one model expert reading of early modern archives? While the question may seem unanswerable, emerging methods may well make its exploration possible. Taking Peter W. M. Blayney's The Bookshops in Paul's Cross Churchyard as test case suggests both points and paths of entry.  Published in 1990, Blayney's work captivates scholars through its extensive, detailed, reconstructive mapping of the churchyard and its shops.  Yet these images' seeming solidity belies the varied, intersecting forms of evidence required for their creation. Here, the layers of access digital media provide stand poised to fuel the curiosity that stimulates research. &#x0D; &#x0D; Tracing the citations of this 1990 text yields a sample of document types vital to its ""book-trade topography,"" including early modern wills, leases, visitation books, and State Papers (Foreign and Domestic), to name a few.

Such a sense of salience results from the ability to identify key points rapidly through deep understanding of ways early modern documents and individuals may intersect. &#x0D; &#x0D; Encoding a range of Blayney's sources, with an eye to marking major entity types each contains, electronically reconstitutes a document-based context where characteristic patterns of relation may be considered further.

12460,FZ-231325-15,"In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries political, religious, and medical elites attempted to decommodify alcohol and other psychoactive drugs whose use had become problematic in an industrializing, urbanizing, and nationally competitive world. The global movement toward restriction and prohibition was, in one sense, ironic. For practically all of human history, alcohol and other food-drugs had actually functioned as means of elite control, aggrandizement, and imperial expansion. As early as 1953 anthropologists put forward the suggestion that civilization itself, without which there would be no elites as we know them, arose in response to the quest for more dependable supplies of alcohol.&#x0D; &#x0D; This paper reviews and critically assess the anthropological, historical, and scientific literature on alcohol, food-drugs, social class, gender, the Neolithic transition, and early civilizations. It argues that, through such practices as competitive feasting and labor pacification, alcohol and other food-drugs did strongly reinforce the hierarchical and gendered labor tendencies inherent to early civilizations. Brewing and food-drug agriculture also helped to spring what historian Yuval Noah Harari has called ""the luxury trap,"" creating patterns of work and trade that kept commoners on a labor treadmill, punctuated by occasional sprees, while their male overlords enjoyed the lion's share of the harvests. The paper concludes by showing how these early developments established an enduring pattern, with substance abuse and addiction—and, more generally, all forms of escapist vice—being paradoxically concentrated in the lower and upper social strata of adult male populations. That pattern persisted throughout history, until the situation became sufficiently fraught with moral and strategic risk that late-modern reformers and policy makers could no longer ignore it.",David T.

12461,CZ-50342-14,"One of the promises of digital humanities is to connect diverse communities through digital projects, transcending traditional limitations of access and public participation. In August 2013, Great Basin College was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Challenge Grant to develop a virtual humanities center to embrace the 86,000 square mile service area which we serve. A central goal of the project is to connect the various communities in the area, whose size and low population density preclude traditional humanities-oriented projects. In the first three years of the project, the Virtual Humanities Center (VHC) at Great Basin College has built projects with two separate communities within our region. The first is the Basque community in Elko desiring to preserve and promote their cultural legacy in the region. The second project comprises seventeen communities of Western Shoshone of northeastern Nevada, whose current interest is Shoshoni language preservation and revitalization using digital techniques to link the communities. These projects have required the VHC to work with numerous institutions, ranging from ethnic social clubs to local museums to academic archives in two states, to develop digital humanities projects. This paper will discuss the challenges involved in promoting and developing digital humanities among such a diverse range of partners, from explaining digital humanities to managing standards and legal obligations across various groups and institutions.

It focuses in particular on eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Anglo-American projects to collect and arrange indigenous words, which were inspired by Thomas Jefferson's comments in Notes on the State of Virginia that it was ""very much to be lamented"" that colonists had ""suffered so many of the Indian tribes already to extinguish"" before men of science had ""collected"" the ""rudiments"" of their languages.  Attempting to make up for lost opportunities, in Notes Jefferson compiled word lists from multiple sources to create a table that linked Natives' languages with their geographic location.  He continued this project in the 1790s, when he created a word list after meeting Unquachog people on Long Island and when he had printed blanks published and distributed to Indian agents, missionaries, government officials, and soldiers.  The lists' material form was designed to elicit particular results: the printed lists of English words and blanks were to be filled in with corresponding Native words.  The lists aimed to ensure that collectors would obtain the same set of words, thus making comparison across multiple languages and conclusions about the relations of those languages and the origins of the people who spoke them.",Kelly Wisecup,,06/23/2016,,,,,"“Transforming Linguistic Collection: Word Lists, Blanks, and Circulation In Native Space,”"

Contextual sources such as notifications in the press, eyewitness accounts, and a large body of mostly unpublished correspondence now suggest that Leoncavallo cloaked the opera's genesis to protect its legacy.&#x0D; Leoncavallo was twice charged with having imitated an existing play (in 1893 Tamayo y Baus's  Un drama nuevo , and in 1894 Catulle Mendès's  La femme de Tabarin ). In his protracted defense, he took every opportunity to distinguish his libretto from the literary tradition (of Tabarin-like ""plays within a play"") to which it belongs and tie it instead to the verismo movement (with which some critics had associated it since the premiere). He began to claim, for instance, that the libretto was based on a crime of passion he had witnessed in Montalto and invented a version of that crime that matched the libretto. Furthermore, in preparation of the first performance in Paris in 1902, he actively contributed to a staging that was to faithfully depict Montalto and the costumes of its people. And as he was tightening the opera's connection to verismo, he was concealing aspects that would have reflected poorly on the opera's reception, including Sonzogno's concerns regarding the quality of the work and the presence of musical borrowings--most notably two substantial, newly identified sections, taken from the composer's French chamber work  La coupe et les lèvres --in the opera's conclusion.",Andreas Giger,,7/7/2017,http://www.musik.unibe.ch/forschung/tagungen/toscbern2017/index ger.html,Conference Web Site,http://www.musik.unibe.ch/unibe/portal/fak historisch/dkk/musik/content/e39911/e155112/e557876/e578479/BookletDruckansicht260617 ger.pdf,Program book,"“Svesti la giubba,” or, Uncloaking the Genesis of  Pagliacci "

By way of example, we present the steps and process in a GitHub repository for computationally probing the unknown and contested authorship of an 1831 short story entitled ""A Dream"" as we seek evidence if this work is similar to other attributed works by Edgar Allan Poe.

12554,FA-251827-17,"Public health was crucial to the success of the American pacification campaign and the ""civilizing process"" in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. In 1905, American colonial officials established a leper colony in Culion, southwest of Manila. To safeguard public health, officials deemed it necessary to forcibly remove ""lepers"" from their homes; however, in 1907, citing limited resources and the difficulty of pregnancy for women with leprosy, they banned cohabitation and marriage within Culion. Colonial officials had downplayed Filipino leprosy patients' opposition to the segregation order. But how did female patients respond to the segregation policy? How did they engage with authorities over such issues as the ban on cohabitation and marriage?&#x0D; &#x0D; This paper advances our understanding of the engagement between Filipino women leprosy patients and colonial officials. This is an understudied theme in literature on empire, medicine, and public health, and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Very few studies of Culion address patients' – mostly men – oppositional views and practices. I argue that female patients, individually and collectively, asserted their sense of self and in so doing, rejected the notion of women as weak, mere followers of the male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.",Febe Pamonag,International Federation for Research in Women’s History (IFRWH) triennial conference,8/12/2018,,,,,The Unruly Women of Culion

12662,FA-232263-16,"Scholars of rhetoric and political communication have for decades argued that the rise of television transformed rhetoric's political spaces. Yet television was not the first visual medium to do so; other visual antecedents are worth attending to as well. Beginning in the late 1920s, a new kind of photography appeared in Europe and the United States, made possible by small, portable cameras capable of producing intimate photographs of seemingly unguarded subjects. These ""miniature"" or ""candid cameras"" provided photographers with a decidedly different way to picture political actors. Of the dramatic difference between the candid camera and its heavier, larger predecessors, one writer of the era said it was like an ""express rifle had been substituted for a pea shooter.""   In 1929, the term ""candid camera"" was coined by the London Daily Graphic to describe the work of German photographer Erich Salomon, whose specialty became the photography of political spaces. Salomon made unposed images of European leaders and diplomats at international conferences and later brought his candid camera to bear on political elites in the U.S. This paper analyzes Salomon's photographs and the public conversation about them to show how the candid camera transformed ideas about political space in Europe and the U.S. between 1928-1932. By taking advantage of the candid camera's ability to foreshorten the physical space between photographer and subject, Salomon's images offered the political sphere new visual values of access, intimacy, and energy. The project illustrates the value of attending to those historically-specific moments when technological change reshapes our real and imagined rhetorical-political spaces.",Cara A.

12698,HB-251279-17,"Bin Jelmood House, part of the Msheireb heritage complex of museums in Doha, Qatar opened in October 2015. This museum is dedicated to the history of slavery, part to its wider global dimensions starting in the ancient world and part to its regional history (especially the 19th and 20th centuries). The museum includes narratives of runaway slaves in the 20th century, collected by the British India Office to facilitate their manumission. These British archival records have also been digitized as part of the Qatar Digital Library (www.qdl.qa). This paper will attempt an analysis of the building of Bin Jelmood House and the reported reaction of descendants of slaves and slave-owners to its building and contrast the Bin Jelmood experience with contemporary efforts at organization by Arabian residents of African descent. This analysis endeavors to shed light on the question ""Is there an African diaspora in the Middle East?"" by finding out whether there is more, less or any evidence of diaspora self-identification in efforts to represent itself in public spaces. This includes looking at whether Afro-Arabian people might be participating in a kind of public history – genealogical research. Newspaper reports, social media posts, any publicly available data analytics from the qdl.qa site and interviews with experts consulted for the Bin Jelmood House project and participants in burgeoning Afro-Arabian advocacy groups will be the basis of this paper.

12712,FT-254515-17,"When considering the artistic landscape in which George Gershwin matured, it is easy to imagine the theaters, concert halls, and opera houses of New York City as a succession of cultural silos. Musicologists have tended to study popular entertainments such as vaudeville, musical comedies, Yiddish theater, and opera as if they were isolated from each other – each style with its own performers, impresarios, influences, and traditions. But, in fact, the entertainers, businessmen, and patrons who powered the engine of the New York cultural scene traveled easily between genres on stage and met each other after hours at the same parties. It was this smorgasbord of dance, theater, and music that nurtured Gershwin in the early years of the twentieth century. Using ""Blue Monday,"" (1922), a one-act opera written for a revue as a case study, I argue that Gershwin's restless search throughout his career for ways to integrate popular and classical music was a logical reaction to his early musical surroundings, which promoted constant genre crossing, sometimes for aesthetic reasons, but also to make larger political or social points through humor and references to cultural touchstones. This short work exemplifies the ways that Gershwin used music to trouble musical, class, and racial boundaries at the same moment that critics were succeeding in creating a cultural hierarchy based upon those same criteria. Seen in this light, Gershwin's music clings to a pre-World War I musical and theatrical aesthetic that valued deft stylistic flexibility that many of his contemporaries eventually abandoned.",Kristen M.

12719,FT-254697-17,"This essay considers the literary taste of African American women readers of the Black Chicago Renaissance during the 1940s. Perhaps the most popular group of these readers was The Book Circle, a local reading club that ran from 1943 through 1993 on the city's South Side neighborhood of Bronzeville. Organized by and for African American women during World War II to ""boost morale,"" The Book Circle met monthly to discuss current works by Bronzeville authors such as Gwendolyn Brooks and Richard Wright. This reading group documented its activities in meticulous records—including constitutions, agendas, photographs, meeting minutes, and scrapbooks—that give insight into their reading habits, reception practices, and literary taste. By analyzing these archival materials in the context of the literature the group read, I illustrate how central the social practices of community reading on the South Side were to writers such as Brooks and Wright. This essay thus offers a detailed assessment of the relationship between private book circles in Bronzeville and some of the neighborhood's most famous writers and texts. In so doing, it also attempts to correct what Elizabeth McHenry has called ""the historical invisibility of black readers."" Indeed, while the work of McHenry, Joycelyn Moody, P. Gabrielle Foreman, Eric Gardner, and other scholars who recover forgotten African American literary communities has focused primarily on eighteenth-and nineteenth-century reading practices, this essay restores an important visibility of twentieth-century black readers, thus recognizing the influence of literary reception outside the academy in the mid twentieth century.",Mary I.

23809,ES-281190-21,"Recently, we have seen the effects of conflict in the war between Ukraine and Russia, as millions have fled the country or have been internally displaced. Simultaneously, thousands of soldiers from foreign countries have streamed into Ukraine, some of whom are expressly termed by the media as ‘mercenaries.' In the late Classical and Hellenistic Periods, thousands of these misthophoroi traversed the Mediterranean to fight for tyrants, kings, and empires (Garland 2014). This presentation will analyze how the experiences of these soldiers, especially their socio-political integration after warfare, is constructed in two chronological/geographical periods/locations, namely 4th-century Sicily and Athens (Chaniotis 2005). This (possible) acceptance into new communities will be evaluated briefly through various source materials. In literature, historiographical accounts often provide important details, while New Comedy also shows the integration of soldiers into the polis (although the comic nature of the text requires careful consideration of their portrayal). Especially in Athens, inscriptions detail administrative efforts to accept or to reject garrisons and individual soldiers, who occasionally are honored for their service to the community (Oliver 2000). In Sicily, archaeological evidence, in changes to urban layouts and material finds left behind by mercenaries, demonstrates how large-scale migrations of soldiers radically transformed the landscape (Harris 2020). Finally, coinage from both locations shows the economic effect of this martial mobility on both soldier and city. By discussing several specific artifacts and passages, this presentation will offer ways in which to reconstruct the experience of soldiers, while also identifying inherent biases and lacunae (Meineck and Konstan 2014). The goal will be to shed light on this important group of migrants who often fall through the cracks of history by showing them not as mindless hordes but as individuals with thei",Jason Harris,The Classical Association of Atlantic States,10/08/2022,http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://caas-cw.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CAAS-Program.09.29.22.pdf,,,,“The Problems and Profits of Reconstructing the Mercenary Experience in the Ancient Greek World”
23810,ES-281190-21,"In the famous Pullo and Vorenus episode from Caesar's Gallic Wars 5.44, we gain insight into the motivation of the individual soldier in Caesar's army—at least insofar as Caesar himself hopes to depict it. On the one hand, Pullo and Vorenus are interested in honor and standing among their fellow soldiers; on the other hand, they certainly have an interest in the many tangible and material awards that the primus pilus may accrue. This paper will focus on the latter as a starting point to understand how Caesar was able to motivate his army throughout the Gallic Wars and beyond, considering, too, the critical role that Caesar's veterans played in the Roman Revolution. Thus, while Caesar's account of military virtus is grounded in ancient Roman values and the warrior ethos, as this paper will argue (cf. esp. Goldsworthy), the reality was far different. As J. E. Landon has argued, ""the real events [of war] are filtered through the literary, intellectual, and cultural assumptions of the author"" (273). The Pullo and Vorenus episode, then, suits Caesar's rhetorical aims perfectly: the individual Roman soldier is intrinsically motivated to perform bravely on the battlefield and his rivalry only extends so far, as both men ultimately help one another escape the enemy. This narrative framework gives Caesar the moral high ground he desires, as individual ambition and military excellence is motivated by honor first and is ultimately channeled towards non-self-interested ends. But the episode may be read in a far richer context, considering the plunder, land, donatives, and public glory that would accrue for a soldier sharing in Caesar's individual glory. This paper, then, will consider Pullo and Vorenus' actions in that fuller context, as a means of understanding their motivations more fully, and in a manner that reaches beyond the narrow rhetorical aims of Caesar's own narrative.",Patrick Lake,The Classical Association of Atlantic States,10/08/2022,http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://caas-cw.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CAAS-Program.09.29.22.pdf,,,,The Rhetoric of Soldierly Motivation in Caesar’s Gallic Wars

The ""forgotten frontera"" explored is that borderland between eastern New Mexico and western Texas, the isolated llano, the southern Great Plains. In 1786, peace treaties between Span and the Comanches led to a period of peace and trade. For the next 90 years, New Mexican pioneers ventured further east onto the plains to hunt bison, trade with the Comanches, and herd sheep. By the time this period came to an end in the 1870s and 80s, New Mexican sheepmen had established ranchos and small settlements in the Texas panhandle and beyond. This period is paid little attention in New Mexican histories more focused on the Rio Grande valley and other more populated areas of the territory. More troubling, the history is largely omitted and whitewashed in Texas because it implicates Texas cattlemen in a violent territorial takeover. This project is thus engaged in analyzing two ethnographic texts, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca's We Fed Them Cactus (1954) and Samuel Leo Gonzales' The Days of Old (1993). Multivalent and genre crossing, these books include rich oral tradition that recount pioneer days, lifeways, and the end of the period with the coming of the Texans.",Alex Hunt,,09/20/2022,https://www.westernlit.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Program-2022-for-distribution-side-by-side.pdf,Western Literature Association conference program 2022  see page 15,,,Forgotten Frontera Ethnography

23952,RA-254182-17,"Books were an important conduit for scientific ideas in the early modern period. A significant feature of many of these books were illustrations depicting the specimens, instruments, and experiments discussed in the text. These images helped circulate knowledge between individual natural philosophers and newly formed intellectual networks forming in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Printed images were also sites of negotiation as book illustrations required the specialized skill of an artist or artisan to engrave, etch, or carve the block or plate. Thus, these images are fruitful sites to study the relationship between author and image-maker.This paper explored the role of images in early modern scientific books, focusing on texts published by the early Académie royale des sciences in Paris. Founded in 1666, the French Academy was one of the first scientific societies in Europe, receiving patronage from King Louis XIV. This generous funding was reflected in their earliest publications which were large, sumptuous, and heavily illustrated. Some of these images were celebrated for their artistic skill as well as scientific accuracy. This paper will examine how these images were negotiated between scientist and artist, as well as their role in disseminating knowledge created by the young Academy.",Katherine Reinhart,American Historical Association 135th Annual Meeting,1/8/2022,https://aha.confex.com/aha/2022/webprogram/Session22415.html,"website page for AHA Annual Meeting, Session 149 presented on Saturday, January 8, 2022 with session abstract and presenters listed",,,Exceedingly Accurate as well as Skillfully Engraven in Copper’: The Role of Images in early Modern Scientific Books

23953,RA-254182-17,"During the seventeenth century new organizations—scientific societies—were created for the collective pursuit of natural philosophy. These centralized institutions became nodes for natural philosophical correspondence within the epistolary networks of the Republic of Letters. For example, Fellow of the Royal Society Henry Oldenburg (1619-1677) wrote and collected thousands of letters during his tenure as the Secretary, many of which were published in the Philosophical Transactions journal. Yet, in addition to textual accounts of experiments, observations, and discoveries, these letters also frequently contained images. From marginalia drawings to engravings amended on separate sheets, visual material was a prominent part of scientific correspondence. What role did images play in the epistolary networks of early scientific societies? How were these ‘visual letters' treated upon their receipt? And how did societal record keeping and copying practices impact the preservation and circulation of these images? Drawn from material in the Royal Society's archives, this paper examines the function of visual letters within natural philosophical correspondence networks in the early modern period.",Katherine Reinhart,Before Mail Art: Visual Letters Workshop,2/23/2022,https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/lives-of-letters/2022/02/09/before-mail-art-visual-letters-workshop-23-feb-2022/,"Webpage of University of Manchester, Events page",,,Drafting Natural Philosophy: The Royal Society’s Visual Letters
23954,RA-254182-17,"How were new ideas about the natural world created and circulated in the global early modern world? And who claimed authority over that knowledge? One of the primary formats was through images. Analyzing how images circulated—both physically and through reproduction—is key to understanding both how new knowledge was created and how rival empires competed to control it. At the same time as European empires were expanding, burgeoning scientific institutions, such as the Royal Society of London, mobilized global networks of philosophers to claim precedence and establish themselves, and their Crown, as the arbiters of new knowledge. Much scholarship analyzes the textual records of the Royal Society, but images are often considered tangential or secondary in the circulation and production of colonial knowledge. This paper examined how images were, instead, fundamental to the circulation and proliferation of new ideas that simultaneously entwined scientific and state interests.",Katherine Reinhart,Renaissance Society Annual Meeting 2022,3/30/2022,https://rsa.confex.com/rsa/2022/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/13046,"webpage for presentation of Katherine Reinhart at Renaissance Society of America Annual Conference held in Dublin, March 30, 2022",,,Art &amp; Empire: Scientific Societies in the Global Early Modern World
23955,RA-254182-17,"This paper will examine the diverse functions of images within a foundational scientific society in France – the Académie royale des sciences in Paris. During the Academy's formative period, from its inauguration in 1666 to the death of King Louis XIV in 1715, the Academy produced a wealth of images in the form of drawings, prints, medallions, and paintings, and was subject to widespread visual representation. Like Accademia dei Lincei in Italy or the Royal Society of London, the Academy was pivotal in the development of early modern natural philosophy as one of the first and best-funded scientific institutions in Europe.  In this paper I explore how various images and objects functioned in the service of knowledge production and as a means of broadcasting monarchical power. For example, the Academy created dozens of drawings during the course of their experiments, dissections, and discoveries, and these drawings, were then used as the basis of scientific debates. These drawings functioned epistemically as critical tools in the Academy's work creating new ideas and theories. In contrast, the many medals and jeton coins created by and for the Academy commemorated significant achievements by the Academy as circulated them as significant moments in the reign of Louis XIV. In this way, these coins and medals functioned politically, both to elevate the status of the Academy and to link it to the status of the crown. Using a series of case-studies across different media, this paper will analyze the diverse functions images and image-making practices served both within the internal operations of the Academy, and outwards to the wider public of government officials and international network of natural philosophers. Ultimately, I argue that a diverse array of visual practices and materials were indispensable to the Academy's projects, and simultaneously provide tangible evidence of the French State's scientific ambitions.",Katherine Reinhart,Images &amp; Institutions: The Visual Culture of Early Modern Scientific Societies,9/16/2022,https://www.biblhertz.it/3292965/images-and-institutions-the-visual-culture-of-early-modern-scientific-societies,"News &amp; events webpage of Bibliotheca Hertziana, Max-Planck-Institut für Kunstgeschichte",https://binghamtonarthistory.wordpress.com/2022/09/15/katherine-reinhart-organizes-international-symposium-images-institutions-in-rome/,webpage of News &amp; events page  Binghampton University,Science &amp; Statecraft: On the Epistemic and Political Functions of Images in the Académie royale des sciences
23956,RA-254182-17,"How was natural knowledge communicated and circulated by scientific societies in the early modern period? One method was through engraved images included in the printed works of these new institutions. An important part of printed books, journals, and treatises, engraved images were a critical component of transmitting knowledge from the private collaborative spaces of halls and meeting rooms to wider audiences. In these publication formats, engraved images helped circulate knowledge between individual natural philosophers and newly formed intellectual networks forming in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the same time, printed images were also sites of negotiation, as they required the specialized skill of an artist or artisan to engrave, etch, or carve the block or plate. Thus, these images are fruitful sites to study the relationship between author and image-maker. This paper discussed the role of engraved images within early modern scientific societies. Focusing on the Royal Society of London and the Académie royale des science in Paris, this paper will explore how the creation of printed images to accompany these institutions' scientific texts was a complex process negotiated by multiple stakeholders. The process of illustrating their written texts required early members of both societies to work with skilled engravers, such as William Faithhorne and Sébastien Leclerc, to create images for their published works. These relationships, varyingly collaborative and antagonistic, directly affected the success of the images and the larger scientific project. Thus, to understand the diverse function of these images within early modern print culture, we must incorporate the viewpoints and practices of both society members and the skilled artists who created them.",Katherine Reinhart,History of Science Society Annual Meeting 2022:,11/17/2022,https://cdn.ymaws.com/hssonline.org/resource/resmgr/annual meeting/2022 program/hss-program-2022.pdf,"Program Book for the HSS Annual Meeting Chicago, IL, USA November 17–20, 202",,,"Intaglio Inquiries: Scientific Academies &amp; The Engraved Image,"""

These elaborate shows simultaneously capitalize on the latest advancements in spectacular performance technologies and engage more deeply with the Chinese literary tradition, often literalizing well-known poetic images or even literally overlaying the stage with projected Chinese characters.

24083,FEL-281761-22,"This paper investigates the ways in which digitally enhanced tourist performance in the PRC mobilize classicist aesthetics and poetics to connect classical literary topoi to a broader shared sense of Chinese culture among audience members. Since the early 2000s, the popularity of Zhang Yimou's ""Impressions Series"" has led to the growth of large-scale performances at destinations such as West Lake in Hangzhou, Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province, and Dunhuang in Gansu Province—locations that also feature prominently in classical poetry, Buddhist religious practice, and the Chinese national imaginary. These elaborate shows capitalize on the latest advancements in spectacular performance technologies and engage with the Chinese literary tradition, often literalizing well-known poetic images and literally overlaying the stage with Chinese characters, landscape paintings, and photographic images. Digital technologies transform live performance into a projection surface, yet in doing so also project a form of classicism that seems only skin deep. Building on the theoretical work of media studies scholars Giuliana Bruno, Audrey Yue, and others, this paper explores the ""surface tensions"" inherent in these works. It argues that while critiques of the superficiality of large-scale performance remain valid, that very superficiality (as well as its rootedness in digital technologies) is also instrumental in enabling classicism to resonate with broader audiences. Examination of surface classicism in popular performances therefore allows us to reconsider the relationship between classicism and cutting-edge technology, materiality and immateriality, liveness and mediation in the digital age.",Tarryn Li-Min Chun,Association for Asian Studies Annual Conference,03/17/2023,,,,,"""Surface Classicism in Large-scale Multimedia Tourist Performance in the PRC"""

The research questions are: 1. How did the teacher's pre-PD role identity shape the ways they learn to teach difficult histories in the context of the PD? 2. To what extent and in what ways did the PD context impact the teacher's role identity shifts when learning to teach difficult histories? We used the Dynamic Systems Model of Role Identity (DSMRI; Kaplan &amp; Garner, 2017) as a theoretical lens. Data sources include individual interviews conducted four times (before and after the summer institute and during and after the follow-up PD); lesson plans collected three times (before and after the summer institute and after the follow-up PD); video recordings of the PD sessions; and pre- and post-surveys. Qualitative data were analyzed using the DSMRI code book (Kaplan &amp; Garner, n.d.). The analysis suggests teachers' prior experiences and self-perceptions about social identity categories (i.e., race and gender) influenced their learning and reflections on teaching difficult histories.","Yonghee Suh, Joanna K.

24146,FEL-273562-21,"In this talk, a new, contextualist interpretation of Kant's ideas of reason is presented and used to interpret Kant's philosophy of science. Drawing on contemporary analytic theories of contextuality, the first part argues that for Kant theoretical knowledge is sufficiently semantically determined and epistemically justifiable only in adequate contexts, and that ideas of reason are needed to demarcate and mentally map these contexts. Accordingly, the regulative use of ideas is not to produce descriptions of an existing or merely imagined metaphysical reality, but to exhibit two kinds of contexts: (i) contexts of intelligibility, within which a human subject can first of all conceive of her experience as a sufficiently semantically determined cognition of an object (of a certain kind), and (ii) contexts of evaluation, within which the truth of cognition could be ultimately judged in view of the world as it is in itself, and from whose projections normative standards for epistemic justifications can be derived. In the second part, this contextualist reading is applied to Kant's philosophy of science to explain Kant's claim that every single science is based on an idea of reason. For example, physics is founded on the idea of absolute space and psychology on the idea of the soul. In its semantic function, the idea of a science thus defines its largest possible context of intelligibility and thus its local ontology. In its epistemic function, this idea represents the ultimate context of evaluation, from the projection of which the standards of knowledge characteristic of the individual science can be obtained and the historical change of theories can be explained. In sum, the contextualist reading can be used to understand both the perspectivist nature of the human sciences and their necessary reference to a perspective-independent reality.",Katharina Kraus,,12/07/2022,,,,,Die Rolle der Ideen in Kants Wissenschaftstheorie: Eine kontextualistische Lesart

12844,FT-255030-17,"Exploring the implications of a distinction Aristotle draws between bios (politically qualified life) and zoe (natural life), Giorgio Agamben develops the notion of bare life, life stripped of political protections. To exemplify the precarity of bare life, Agamben turns not to the ubiquitous figure of the ancient slave but to homo sacer, an obscure figure of Roman law. This despite the fact that the passage in the Politics where Aristotle distinguishes bios from zoe continues with a discussion of natural slavery. Agamben returns to that passage and its treatment of slavery in the final volume of his Homo Sacer project, The Use of Bodies (2016). There, however, rather than deepening his genealogy of bare life, he elaborates ""a theory of use."" He stipulates messianic dimensions for this theory. Quoting 1 Cor 7:21, Agamben contends, ""The messianic call…consists first of all in the capacity to ‘use' the factical condition in which each one finds himself."" Agamben speculates that ""the use of the body"" in slavery ""evoke[s] the paradigm of a human activity that is reducible neither to labor, nor to production, nor to praxis."" He imagines an originary ""community of life"" between master and slave, an elision of the brute force fundamental to despotic relationships. Following Agamben's philological lead, I investigate Paul's use of chresis and cognates in passages involving either slaves or invocations of slavery and freedom Agamben's take on ""use"" is belied by standard Greek idioms. Moreover, the conception of slavery in terms of mutual use obscures the precarity inherent in the lives of enslaved.

Secondarily, I also consider the ways in which these shifts affected intimate aspects of everyday life in the West. In the concluding section, I argue that, historically, social struggles for the control of meanings related to body and soul have been important – precisely because these struggles have not been about mere meanings detached from life, but about aspects of life itself. Understanding the effects that these kinds of ideas and beliefs have historically had is critical in an age such as ours, which is witnessing the rise of various forms of religious fundamentalism and the return of religious war.

12846,AQ-234985-16,"The transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance carried important and enduring changes in the way Westerners conceived the body and the soul, shifts in perspective that initially transformed key aspects of (Renaissance) art, including music, as well as literature and philosophy. Renewed interest in anatomy, in particular, forced Renaissance artist and thinkers to reconfigure their ideas of the body and its relationship to the soul. Anatomists searched for the soul by dissecting cadavers; artist dissected the body to better convey the human spirit; and writers dissected the soul through their work; and they thus set in motion paradigmatic upheavals that eventually resulted in changes in the ways Westerners understood the idea of the human, both theoretically as well as at the level of collective beliefs. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the body/soul rhetoric was recast during the Renaissance; how these changes affected the arts and literature of the period, and show that changes in beliefs and preoccupations pertaining to the body and the soul powerfully contribute to shaping cultural products (e.g., artistic and literary) as well as important aspects of everyday life.

12966,FA-232662-16,"Scholars have asked how empires solidify power when colonizers, the agents of empire-building, often have diverse goals and backgrounds and their actions do not necessarily support the goals of the empire. Two answers to this question have received attention: that empires promote ideologies that support cohesion among colonizers, and that coercion and violence can promote the expansion of empires. I propose a third answer, in which colonizers create varied material forms that may challenge the goals of empire, but later appeal to the king for regulation and control over the material world. To illustrate this case, I use the example of coins among Spanish colonizers in Mexico City. Colonizers invented and used a variety of coins, in part by diluting gold into different alloys to make up for the scarcity of gold that they found in the colonies. Thus, they challenged imperial authority by creating new ways of measuring value and wealth (in this case, by creating more wealth with diluted gold). But when they found that their new coins created problems of conversion and exchange, they appealed to the crown requesting regulations over the minting, value, and use of different coins, thereby strengthening imperial authority.",Enrique Rodríguez-Alegría,Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology.,4/13/2018,,,,,Coins and Empire in Sixteenth-century Mexico.
12969,FT-61611-14,"One of the prevailing truisms of globalization is that we live in an era of pandemic threats, of rapid travel and dangerous proximity that facilitate the adaptation, spread, and (re)emergence of infectious diseases, and that consequently we need robust systems of disease surveillance to protect public health and even species life.  As international news outlets and supranational health organizations such as WHO repeatedly warn us, we are one viral mutation away from the end of the world as we know it.  If Foucault's chapter on ""Panopticism"" opened with a description of the plague-stricken town, in the new millennium, the most potent and haunting icon of disease is not the afflicted city or the epidemic nation but the pandemic planet.  In recent years, however, a range of critics have flipped the causal chain of this story to emphasize the ways the biosecurity state underlies and produces this contemporary imagining of global contagion.  My paper will discuss several of these arguments and their implications for the thinking of power: science historian Nicholas King's ""emerging diseases worldview,"" sociologist Melinda Cooper's ""preemption,"" and philosopher Brian Massumi's ""ontopower.""  Infectious disease discourse in the broad sense, then, encompassing not just state rhetoric but that of health organizations and the media as much as literary and scholarly writing, offers a key site for reexamining and extending models of biopower in our time.",Belinda Kong,"American Comparative Literature Association (ACLA) Annual Conference, Seminar on ""The New Security State: Surveillance, Counter-Surveillance, and Strategies of Resistance""",03/19/2016,https://www.acla.org/sites/default/files/files/Full Program Guide 2016.pdf,ACLA 2016 conference program,,,"The Pandemic Planet: Disease Discourse, Biosecurity States, and Contemporary Biopower"
12973,FT-61611-14,"Priscilla Ward has suggested that, in the post-HIV world, a set of tropes have emerged in both scientific and cultural accounts of infectious diseases, constituting what she calls an ""outbreak narrative.""  One common feature of this narrative is a ""geography of disease"" in which ""timeless, brooding Africa or Asia"" serves as ""the birthplace of humanity, civilization, and deadly microbes.""  While Ward's archive is largely western, this paper examines a work of outbreak narrative from one Asian site at the height of an epidemic -- the lowbrow Hong Kong film CITY OF SARS.  Produced and released in the summer of 2003, while SARS was still spreading throughout the world and the WHO travel advisory on Hong Kong had not yet been lifted, this movie is decidedly local in its address.  Drawing on a host of locally well-known television actors and entertainment personalities (rather than the handful of arthouse movie stars who have international renown) and split into three independent storylines about how ordinary people deal with the outbreak, the film mobilizes several popular genres familiar to local viewers: the hospital drama, the sentimental adolescent romance, and farce.  The last segment especially offers an innovative form of what I call epidemic camp.  On the local level, the movie's generic storylines can be read as providing a sense of normality and continuity, even banality, amid a time of crisis for the city.  On the global level, they can be invoked to disrupt the logic of contemporary western outbreak narratives, particularly what I have called pandemic orientalism elsewhere.  Critical attention to self-representations at those epidemic sites can generate a powerful counterdiscourse to the ongoing rhetoric of global health security in our time.",Belinda Kong,Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS) Annual Conference,03/14/2018,http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.cmstudies.org/resource/resmgr/2018 conference/SCMS2018Iprogram-no rooms.pdf,Conference program,,,"SARS, Hong Kong Cinema, and Epidemic Camp"
12974,FT-61611-14,"In post-millennial Chinese literature, we find a recurrent and acute concern with the body in capital—a genre I will call biocapitalist fiction.  This preoccupation with China's new biopolitical regimes cuts across national and linguistic boundaries, uniting mainland and diasporic as well as Sinophone and Anglophone writers.  Against the utopian rhetoric of Chinese capitalism as post-socialist freedom, contemporary writers insistently spotlight authoritarian capital's predation on the body as a vehicle for state profit.  Diasporic authors such as Yan Geling, Yiyun Li, and Ma Jian, for instance, have carried forward the themes of biocapitalist cannibalism and reproductive control in earlier mainland works by Mo Yan and Wang Shuo, all of them sharing a dystopic hyperrealism of the present.  More rarely tackled yet equally provocative is the fate of future Chinese bodies.  My paper will examine two recent works that address this issue: Chan Koonchung's The Fat Years and Xiaolu Guo's UFO in Her Eyes.  Published in 2009, the former in Chinese and the latter in English, both novels forecast near-future Chinas, the first of global economic dominance and the second of rapid rural commercialization.  In contrast to other biocapitalist fictions, however, Chan's and Guo's texts raise the question: what kind of political order comes into being and what becomes of embodied life itself when the target of state biopower is no longer an isolated subject or specific social identity—such as the political dissident, the star athlete, the male baby, or the reproductive mother—but simply the generic citizen, every citizen?",Belinda Kong,Association for Asian Studies (AAS) Annual Conference,03/29/2014,https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aas/aas14/index.php?click key=1&amp;cmd=Multi+Search+Load+Person&amp;people id=4118431&amp;PHPSESSID=gk50a9u580mc0itiesk614ive1,AAS 2014 Conference paper info,,,Fleshing Out the Future: Speculative Fictions of China’s Biocapitalism in Chan Koonchung’s The Fat Years and Xiaolu Guo’s UFO in Her Eyes
12976,FT-61611-14,"The past decade has marked the emergence and spread of biocapital scholarship—analyses of biopower in relation to capitalism.  This theoretical approach has been cross-disciplinary but particularly alive in the social sciences, as anthropologists and sociologists examine the power relations and capitalist dynamics of such areas as the life sciences (Franklin and Lock), biomedicine (Rose), genomics (Sunder Rajan), biotechnology (Ong and Chen), and state governance (Greenhalgh), among others.  So, while the term biopower originated with Foucault in reference to Western contexts, it is now deployed as a broader research method by many social scientists in probing present capitalist milieus.  In particular, many scholars focus on Asia as a major force in current technologies and sciences of life—in effect, as the site where much of our contemporary understanding of life's boundaries get defined.  This paper traces the most prominent scholarship on biocapitalism in recent years.  In addition, it proposes the relevance and fruitfulness of biocapital as a theoretical framework for reading contemporary Asian fiction, with special attention to post-Tiananmen Chinese and Chinese diaspora fiction.",Belinda Kong,American Comparative Literature Association (ACLA) Annual Conference,03/21/2014,https://www.acla.org/sites/default/files/files/Full Program Guide 2014.pdf,ACLA 2014 conference program,,,Theorizing Biocapital: Why Asia?

12977,FT-61611-14,"I use Xiaolu Guo's novel UFO IN HER EYES not only as a case study for biocapitalist fictions but also as a conceptual entry point into the broader question of how Anglophone texts can be read alongside Sinophone ones and how they together constitute one strand of contemporary Chinese literature.  At the most basic level, this analysis opposes models of linguistic or national essentialism.  To some extent, my analysis still relies on writers' shared ethnic identity for the category of ""Chinese"" literature, but recent scholarship on comparative ethnicity within a transnational framework should help complicate this seemingly straightforward reading.  Ultimately, I am interested in how Chinese biocapitalist fictions represent one of the most prominent specimens of the totalitarian dystopia genre in world literature today, and by extension, how this genre actively shapes global discourses on Chinese power.  What counts as ""Chinese literature,"" then, is not simply the ethnic identity of the author or the thematic content of the narrative, but also this discursive function of the text within a contemporary global cultural economy.",Belinda Kong,"Duke Workshop on ""Remapping a Discipline: Modern Chinese Literary Literatures Conference"" (by invitation only)",04/03/2014,,,,,Anglophone Chinese Literature: The Case of Xiaolu Guo
12982,FT-255126-17,"This paper tells the story of a man named Bartholomew Fenton (the subject of my next book) and explores the relationships between militia service, racial violence, and republican manhood during the American Revolution. In 1770, Fenton was a convict servant in Virginia, exiled from London for the crime of petty theft. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, Fenton had made his way to the contested territory of Kentucky. He mustered in the frontier militia during the war, fighting in the intense violence of 1777 and participating in the emergence of a discourse of  ""Indian hating"" that would shape the intensity of western warfare. Fenton's service earned him a land claim in Kentucky. He established himself as a freeholder in the new American republic and eventually purchased two female slaves. In 1792, Fenton was arrested for brutally beating one of these slave women to death. After he was arrested and tried, a jury acquitted him of all charges. Through Fenton's story, we witness an ordinary man's passage from colonial servant to republican citizen and gain intimate perspective on the role that racialized violence played in this transformation. Once a dependent servant with a criminal past, Fenton was reborn in frontier war as a man of status and privilege in a republic that shrouded its fetish for racial difference with the language of human equality. Crucial to that rebirth was a shifting understanding of what constituted legitimate violence and who possessed the right to wield it. In the context of the revolution, Fenton acquired a new and special destiny as a white male citizen of the American republic, an identity that was rooted in landed status, forged in the cauldron of Indian war, and secured in violent mastery over slave property.",Honor Sachs,,11/3/17,,,,,"The Servant, the Soldier, and the Slaveholder: Race, Violence, and Manhood in Eighteenth-Century Border War"

13380,RQ-50842-14,"Franz Boas's 1897 report, The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians, was a landmark in anthropology for its integrative approach to museum collections, photographs, and sound recordings as well as text. However, both Boas and his Indigenous collaborator George Hunt remained dissatisfied with the published text, laboring for decades to correct and supplement it. They left behind a vast archive of materials related to the book's creation and afterlife that are now widely distributed across institutional, disciplinary, and international borders. This paper discusses a collaborative project to create an annotated critical edition of the work that unites published and unpublished materials with museum collections and with Kwakwaka'wakw knowledge in an interactive, multimedia website. Archival revelations about the truly co-authored nature of the original text allow us to better situate the contexts and methods of creating ethnographic knowledge in terms of the Indigenous ontologies it purports to represent.

I analyze the parallels Cordeiro constructed between non-representational abstraction and day-to-day, material reality and his criticisms of the private, exclusionary nature of the new modern art institutions in Brazil in relationship to his engagement with the discourses of Marxism and formalist art theory. Challenging an account of the history of Brazilian abstraction that centers the international contact fostered by the first São Paulo Bienal (1951) and the influence of Max Bill, I explore Cordeiro and his contemporaries' manifold immersion in the history and theory of modernism and the heterodox early abstract practice of Cordeiro and fellow Grupo Ruptura members, including Geraldo de Barros.",Adele Nelson,"Encounters, Utopias, and Experimentation: From Pre-Columbian Tenochtitlan to Contemporary Buenos Aires, Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA Symposium, The Getty Research Institute",11/5/2017,http://153.10.241.9/museum/programs/lectures/media/pst symposium program.pdf,Program for Getty Center Conference,http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/events/event/view/getty-pst-la-la-symposium,Announcement of event on site dedicated to the Pacific Standard Time initiative of the Getty Foundation.,"Art as Real, Direct Construction: Waldemar Cordeiro and Grupo Ruptura"
13001,FT-61616-14,"""There is no reason why my pre-1959 work should be taken seriously,"" Hélio Oiticica stated in 1972, dismissing the hundreds of works he produced in the mid- to late 1950s as an unoriginal working through of other artists' ideas-""infinitesimated mondrianstructure."" Oiticica's thinking about European modernism and the art and ideas of Paul Klee, Kazimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian, in particular, was indeed paramount in his production of these years, as he expressed in a gouache on cardboard work from 1958 he retrospectively titled MALEKLEDRIAN in Four Positions (MALEKLEDRIAN em 4 posições). Scholars have persuasively interpreted Malevich and Mondrian as key interlocutors for Oiticica in his abandonment of painting and pictorial space in favor of three-dimensional and social space, but Klee's significant role has gone largely unanalyzed. Klee was among the first modern artists whose work Oiticica viewed in significant quantities in person, at the National Gallery of Art and possibly the Klee Room at the Phillips Collection when his family lived in Washington, D.C., between 1947 and 1949, and at the remarkable historical displays at the second Bienal de São Paulo in 1953-54. He also acquired numerous Klee monographs during the 1950s. Moreover, Klee's stylistic heterodoxy was central to the expanded conception of modernism put forward by critic Mário Pedrosa, whose writings and ideas were foundational to Oiticica's own. As I will argue, Oiticica's interest in Klee - documented in sketches, writings, and works over the course of the 1950s - encompassed more than formal concerns and extended to the foundations of Oiticica's conception of art making as an ethical, nonlinear practice.",Adele Nelson,"Critical Interventions on Latin/o American Art Conference, Department of Spanish and Portuguese, University of California, Berkeley",9/25/2017,http://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/events/event/critical-interventions-on-latino-american-art-beatriz-balantas-natalia-brizuela-claire-fox-esther-gabara-adriana-johnson-suzanne-li-puma-china-medel-adele-nelson-fernando-rosenberg-2/,"Program of conference at University of California, Berkeley",,,There is No Repetition: Hélio Oiticica's Early Practice
13002,FT-61616-14,"In the early 1960s, Pape exhibited the two works, both unbound books, in tandem in the and she and critics discussed the works as interconnected projects. One was Book of Creation (1959-60), widely considered a landmark work in postwar art history, now held in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and as an embodiment of the participatory principles of Neo-Concretism - the movement that has received more attention than any other of Brazil's contributions to contemporary art. The other is the lesser known Poemas-Xilogravuras (Poems-Woodcuts) (1960), composed of fourteen sheets of cardboard printed with poems and woodcuts on cardboard. And indeed Poemas-Xilogravuras soon receded into the background of Pape's representation of her production and the work has been little studied by historians. Placing the works back into relation to one another, I argue, reinforces an original and radical component of Book of Creation, namely the withholding of language. The juxtaposition of the two projects allows us to perceive the different representational and expressive labor Pape assigns to language, touch, and vision in the description of nature.",Adele Nelson,"To Live is to Invent: Perspectives on the Art and Life of Lygia Pape, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York",5/4/2017,http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-speaks/symposia/lygia-pape-symposium,Program of conference at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,http://www.metmuseum.org/metmedia/video/lectures/lygia-pape-symposium-afternoon,Video of conference proceedings,"Lygia Pape, Fields, and Language"
13016,FA-232749-16,"Most Christians in late antiquity understood imperially sanctioned violence against the earliest Christians as the unjustified persecution of martyrs by an empire that was at odds with God.   Nevertheless, Christians in positions of power after the rise of the emperor Constantine often explained imperially sanctioned violence against their religious opponents as the justified suppression of heresy, a narrative that complicated the position of Christians who rejected imperial orthodoxy, such as those who denounced the legitimacy of the Council of Chalcedon after 451.  One consequence of this post-Constantinian challenge is that narratives of violence pervade the fifth- and sixth-century anti-Chalcedonian writings of John Rufus, Zachariah Rhetor, Philoxenos of Mabbug, Severus of Antioch, and John of Ephesus, as these authors depict their heroes as the most recent martyrs in a long line of suffering saints who persevered in Christian truth in the face of unjust imperial persecution.  The fact, though, that these authors retained a narrative of their community as God's suffering saints even when they had imperial support under the emperor Anastasius (r. 491-518), highlighting in those years their heroes' self-imposed struggles from ascetic hardships more than physical injuries from imperial violence, demonstrates that their stories of suffering were carefully crafted for rhetorical effect in each new context.  Faced with a variety of threats to their followers' allegiance over the decades, ranging from bloody physical violence to the attractive temptations of bribery, these sixth-century leaders persistently represented anti-Chalcedonian Christians as suffering saints in the lineage of the early martyrs in the hope of defending their doctrinal legitimacy regardless of who currently held sway in the imperial capital, and of thus reducing the rate of apostasy from their churches.",Christine Shepardson,Religious Violence in Antiquity: New Perspectives,07/15/2017,,,,,Spinning Violence: Narrating the Suffering of Early Anti-Chalcedonian Saints
