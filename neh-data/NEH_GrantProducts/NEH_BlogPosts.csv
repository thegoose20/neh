Is the occurrence of the word ‘love' the same in the comedies and tragedies? This post is different. WordSeer has now developed enough to support a simple, but complete, exploratory analysis.  The question we'll think about is this:  ""How does the portrayal of men and women in Shakespeare's plays change under different circumstances?""  As one answer, we'll see how WordSeer suggests that when love is a major plot point, the language referring to women changes to become more physical, and the language referring to men becomes more sentimental.",Aditi Muralidharan,Text Mining and the Digital Humanities,2012-01-24,http://mininghumanities.com/2012/01/24/men-and-women-in-shakespeare/,Blog post at mininghumanities.com,,,Men and Women in Shakespeare,http://mininghumanities.com

There are only a limited number different queries they can think of to describe that concept, but they may be missing many other instances that use different words. This is an important issue for humanities scholars. Often, the very first step of a literature analysis is to comb through text, trying to find  thought-provoking examples to study later.  In this post, I give an example of how our project WordSeer, a text analysis environment for humanities scholars, can be used to overcome this problem.

Occasionally, a very intriguing collection will come with a minimum of identifying information about the woman to whom it belonged. I interviewed Stacy E. Wood, a Graduate Student Researcher working on processing the Mazer collections for UCLA, about one such collection: The Martha Foster Collection. While looking through the Mazer holdings at UCLA, Wood came across Foster's papers, which included a small amount of poetry and many striking photographs, taken in her backyard in Echo Park in the early 1930s. ""They're really gorgeous,"" says Wood. ""They almost look like test costume shots. There are hundreds of them. And I couldn't find any information about her.

3007,PW-51045-12,"This blog post explores how the pioneering curator, Harald Szeemann, revitalized and expanded the Venice Biennale.  As an independent curator, nurturer of the arts, and staunch advocate of new artists, Szeemann left an enormous legacy—both intellectual and physical, that is of tremendous interest to scholars, researchers and the general public nationally and globally. The Szeemann archive, held by the Getty Research Library is currently being processed by special collections catalogers at the Getty Research Institute which was made possible in part through support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The ""Project files"" series will be the first to be catalogued and made publically available.  Szeemann is known for his innovative and thought- provoking exhibitions held many influential positions during his career, including his appointment as the Visual Arts Director of La Biennale di Venezia for 1999 and 200—the only person with the distinction of holding this position for more than one term. Most notably, he became the first curator to include multiple contemporary Chinese artists in a traditionally Western-oriented institution. He also juxtaposed more well-known artists with up-and-coming ones in the same spaces. Szeemann envisioned a space that would blur traditional boundaries, and preferred the international show to be more of a ""melting pot,"" while respecting the effect of the Biennale to reinforce national identities.&#x0D; &#x0D; ",Melanie Tran,,2013-05-31,http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/treasures-from-the-vault-harald-szeemanns-project-files/,"This URL links to ""The Getty Iris"" an online Getty magazine that features articles on ""Treasures from the Vault,"" such as this blog article ""Harald Szeemann’s Project Files,"" which is directly accessible though this link.",,,"Treasures from the Vault: Harald Szeemann's ""Project Files""",
3013,PW-51045-12,"This blog post explores the curatorial vision of Harald Szeemann, who in 1969 declared his independence. Resigning from the Kunsthalle Bern, the curator decided to pursue an independent career outside of traditional art institutions and to personally assume every single decision and risk in his projects, from the very first concept to the final dismantling of the exhibition. He chose ""From Vision to Nail"" as one of the mottos for his newly established Agency for Intellectual Guest Labor, a one-man enterprise and a conceptual tool to identify his activity in the economic, political, and artistic fields. ""From Vision to Nail"" could be easily applied as a catchphrase to the main section of Szeemann's archive, the Project Files, which are now open for research at the Getty Research Institute. The archive consisting of more than 500 boxes containing thousands of papers, documents the curatorial process of his more than 150 exhibitions, spanning a nearly 50-year career.  Previously scattered between Bern and Ticino, Switzerland, in the mid-1980s the archive was permanently housed on two floors of a former watch factory in Maggia, Switzerland.  The Szeemann archive is now located in the United States, through recent acquisition by the Getty Research Institute (Los Angeles, CA).  Accelerated public access to the Project Files for new scholarship, research, and artistic production has been made possible through generous funding support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).",Pietro Rigolo,,2013-06-26,http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/treasures-from-the-vault-harald-szeemann-from-vision-to-nail/,"This URL links to ""The Getty Iris"" an online Getty magazine that features articles on ""Treasures from the Vault,"" such as this blog article ""Harald Szeemann, From Vision to Nail,"" which is  directly accessible though this link.

When you unpack them, you find a box within a box. It might contain some black and white photographs: someone in a nurse's uniform, someone carrying a flag. It might hold a set of medals, an old cap, a pair of worn-in boots, or a government-issued recipe booklet on how forgoing sugar will help win the war, with handwritten annotations next to the family favorites. When looking through these items, you might remember as a child playing with the medals or watching a face light up when looking at a photograph. While many of us have no direct experience with military combat, we often live with the souvenirs, objects, and other remnants passed down from those who did. Sometimes, the objects collected or saved by our relatives, friends, and neighbors who have participated in the last century's wars linger on as memorials. These tell us much about how members of our families and communities contributed to wartime activities, overseas and at home.

It was not the first German newspaper in the state. German language journalism in western Virginia precedes the Civil War with the Virginische Staats-Zeitung, (Virginia State Newspaper) 1848 – 1863, which became the West Virginische Staats-Zeitung following West Virginia statehood in 1863.

22819,FEL-273250-21,"This blog explores the life of the enslaved Sidi Asim/Paulo, an African-origin Gujarati merchant who was enslaved off the Swahili coast and sold to a fisherman in Portuguese Goa before escaping, only to be recaptured by the inquisition upon his return to Goa as part of the Mughal ambassador's entourage. Using his life, I argue for the need to attend to a history of subaltern mobility. The legacies of runaway slaves like Sidi Asim/Paulo is apparent across the landscape of the Konkan coast: shrines dedicated to deities called khaprideva attract worshippers along the coast of Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka, while kappiri mutappan in Kochi is a legacy of the city's past as an emporium for African slaves. In these shrines, runaway slaves of African descent are commemorated obliquely, even when popular memory and mainstream historiography are largely blind to their presence in the past. It is landscapes like this, defined by histories of subaltern mobility, that requires historicization. These voyages, often undertaken out of fear and predicated on violence, are a testament to the creative spatial practices of historical actors attempting to escape the strictures that confined them. Following the pathways of these travellers allows us to see the porosity and fragility of political boundaries asserted by elites and to free our geographical imaginations which are too often beholden to such fictions of power.",Ananya Chakravarti,Collation,2021-09-21,https://collation.folger.edu/2021/09/unsung-travelers/,,,,Unsung Travelers: a history of global mobility from below,"Folger Library, Collation Blog website"

The Plague of Provence was a major disaster that left in its wake as many as 126,000 deaths, as well as new understandings about the nature of contagion and the best ways to manage its threat. In this transnational study, Cindy Ermus focuses on the social, commercial, and diplomatic impact of the epidemic beyond French borders, examining reactions to this public health crisis from Italy to Great Britain to Spain and the overseas colonies. She reveals how a crisis in one part of the globe can transcend geographic boundaries and influence society, politics, and public health policy in regions far from the epicentre of disaster.",Cindy Ermus,,2022-12-02,https://www.cambridgeblog.org/2022/12/the-great-plague-scare-of-1720-disaster-and-society-in-the-eighteenth-century-world/,,,,The Great Plague Scare of 1720: Disaster and Diplomacy in the Eighteenth-Century AtlanticWorld,Fifteeneightyfour: Cambridge University Press Blog

23751,RZ-255604-17,"This boat made its final journey in Spring 2018. The boat has no name or indication of country of origin, but Tunisian water bottles tucked under the hull on the landward side give us a clue. This plexiglass boat bears no resemblance to the small wooden fishing boats used by locals, thus we suspect that it served to transport undocumented migrants across the Sicilian Channel from Tunisia to Sicily. The boat is smaller than those unseaworthy wrecks shown in the news, highlighting the differences in the forms that forced migration can take, even in the same part of the world. Clothing and personal items from landing sites nearby allow us to infer that this boat would have been used by a small group, probably young men, probably Tunisian nationals, who by making the crossing were repeating a behavior with a deep, millennia-long history.  After getting off the boat the travelers on that last voyage would have, if lucky, dispersed into the Sicilian countryside either on foot or by car. The boat therefore represents the maritime portion of a longer journey, perhaps one it made many times before being abandoned. From its burnt out state and missing engine, it has undergone changes since landing on this quiet shore in western Sicily. Who destroyed it, the travelers or locals? We cannot know. This boat nonetheless tells of small-scale voyages in both directions that together form an enduring shared history that national borders cannot suppress.","R. Schon, E.

24075,RA-285526-22,"The purpose of this essay is to underscore how the CAORC-NEH Senior Fellowship to Senegal opened up numerous doors for me - both figuratively and literally - as both a scholar and field researcher, many of them unanticipated. Thanks to support from CAORC, in 2018 I was able to conduct four months of intensive fieldwork among communities in Casamance researching Senegal's Joola shipwreck, in which 1,863 people died aboard a passenger ferry bound for Dakar when it sailed into a storm. I'm especially proud that my book, ""Africa's Joola Shipwreck: Causes and Consequences of a Humanitarian Disaster"" was released in 2021, an accomplishment that would not have been possible without the support of CAORC - NEH.  This Fall, the National Association of the Families of the Victims of the Joola (ANFV) awarded me the Knight of the Order of the Joola for my bringing Senegal's story to an American audience, their highest honor. While I am grateful for this important accolade, I also believe there remains significant work ahead as we launch a second, collaborative book highlighting the 20th anniversary of the wreck, post-disaster recovery, and community resilience. We will return to Casamance, Senegal in 2022 to work on this project, while also commencing a new study featuring the cultural values of baobab",Karen Barton,CAORC Field Notes,2021-11-01,http://www.caorc.org/post/a-geographer-s-field-notes-exploring-connections-between-mexico-and-senegal,,,,A Georgrapher's Field Notes: Exploring Connections between Mexico and Senegal,www.caorc.org

While that is still the focus of my research, with the advent of the pandemic and the subsequent roll out of public health measures, including vaccines, to counter the virus, I have found myself increasingly engaged with the current debates over those measures. Although I am always attentive to the differences between the world that I study and the world in which I live, the reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine have given me useful insight into  how public health measures have dredged up many of the same concerns over women's bodies and government intervention that hindered the extension of first inoculation and then vaccination against smallpox more than two hundred years ago.",Allyson Poska,Author's Blog,2022-03-12,http://jwomenshistory.org/jwh-author-allyson-poska/,,,,Researching Vaccination during the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://jwomenshistory.org/

My intention here is not to present a chronological account of the role Native Americans have played in the history of the US armed forces. For those who are interested in learning more about this history, Watson Library has recently acquired a copy of Why We Serve: Native Americans in the United States Armed Forces, a catalog which accompanied an exhibition of the same title that took place at the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) from November 11, 2020 to February 28, 2021.",Amanda Raquel Dorval,,2022-11-09,https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/articles/2022/11/library-artistic-legacy-of-native-american-veterans,,,,A Salute to the Artistic Legacy of Native American Veterans,In Circulation

Biblioteques i Arxius Valencians (València, Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua - Universitat de Barcelona - Universitat de València, 2013). Este primer volumen, que recoge las descripciones de los manuscritos e impresos antiguos conservados en bibliotecas y archivos de la Comunidad Valenciana. El libro es el fruto de años de trabajo con los fondos valencianos, cuyas primeras descripciones codicológicas se remontan a un ya lejano 1991 cuando se realizó el primer desplazamiento de los colaboradores de BITECA a la ciudad del Turia. Desde entonces han seguido otros muchos viajes de estudio hasta el 2009, en que se compilaron los datos obtenidos hasta entonces para la elaboración del presente volumen. En él se ofrecen detallados estudios codicológicos y bibliográficos de los manuscritos, incunables y ediciones del siglo XVI que transmiten obra medieval catalana. Cierra el volumen un completo y útil juego de índices: de bibliotecas y ejemplares; de correspondencia entre los identificadores de BITECA y los ejemplares vinculados a bibliotecas y archivos valencianos; de correspondencia de los ejemplares impresos conservados en bibliotecas y archivos valencianos con los ejemplares principales; de autores y obras; de primeros versos; de personas e instituciones relacionadas con los ejemplares descritos en el libro y, finalmente, índice topográfico.

12801,RA-50142-14,"In 1929, it was socially acceptable for women to smoke at home and in certain public spaces, such as a hotel lobby. Smoking on the streets, however, was another matter altogether. George Washington Hill, the president of the American Tobacco Company, sought to quash this old taboo. He enlisted a public relations consultant, Edward Bernays, who had, in his years as a press agent, perfected the art of ""creating circumstances"" that would attract favorable coverage—and thus free publicity—in newspapers. For this job, Bernays consulted a psychoanalyst who suggested that smoking cigarettes was a sublimation of oral eroticism—to do it openly would be a dramatic symbol of women's emancipation. The cigarettes would become, the psychoanalyst said, ""torches of freedom."" This led Bernays to stage a parade on Easter Sunday of 10 young debutantes who would, in the interest of the ""equality of the sexes,"" light their cigarettes and march down New York's Fifth Avenue—with male escorts—to proclaim their liberation and equality. Bernays exploited his connections with the press to ensure that the parade would be widely photographed and covered in newspapers. In the end, the march caused a national stir, and Bernays had effectively used the press to transform the progressive impulse of feminism into a boost in cigarette sales for his client.",Joseph Malherek,AHA Today,2017-03-23,http://blog.historians.org/2017/03/creating-circumstances-edward-bernays-psychoanalysis-and-the-making-of-american-consumer-culture/,"AHA Today publishes posts on a variety of topics relevant to AHA members and the history discipline.

Smaller outbreaks were reported over the next few decades with two occurrences in the 1940s, continuing to terrify the populace. On average, over 800 cases and 40 deaths were reported yearly. Doctors were soon developing and experimenting with preventive treatments including gamma globulin, an injectable solution made with the polio antibodies. Gamma globulin was introduced to the public in 1950 and showed some effectiveness in preventing the disease. Because the solution was made from blood, supply was limited and could not be a long-term remedy. Parents' desperation to protect their children coupled with the restricted availability of the treatment led to sit-ins and protests demanding more access to gamma globulin from the Department of Health.",Katie Ehrlich and Clint Johnson,,2018-05-24,http://http://www.archives.nyc/blog/2018/5/24/mass-inoculation-or-how-new-york-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-polio-vaccine?rq=health,,,,Mass Inoculation or: How New York Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Polio Vaccine,"For the Record, Blog of the New York City Department of Records and Information Services"

Shrady, which proclaimed with great certainty that a disease ""of such a mild type"" did not pose any serious danger to the American people. After describing common symptoms and recommended treatments for a disease popularly known as ""the grip,"" Shrady reassured the public that ""the epidemic of influenza"" was neither unusual nor dangerous. This editorial quickly reached a much broader audience when newspapers across the United States republished most or all of the text or referenced the journal's authoritative statements about the disease.

And is there ever a good reason for students who are capable of reading Romeo and Juliet to study a graphic novel adaptation of Shakespeare's play instead? We assume we aren't the only English teachers to have wrestled with these questions. And yet we hear these ideas described as problematic because some teachers assume that popular culture and canonical literature exist in an antagonistic relationship.

First, most of the web archiving tools available today, like the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, Archive.Today or Pinboard, are primarily built on visual metaphors and thus neglect, or at least push to the background, the role of audio. Second, preserving audio formats often requires preserving the sounds themselves as well as the technologies on which to play those sounds. Like so many other digital media, web audio is hard to hear not just because it is hard to find and save but because it is hard to know what to save along with it to make it playable in the future. Driscoll and Diaz's claim that ‘the role of music, sound, and noise in computer games remains relatively under examined'[2] also applies to web sounds more generally, and even more acutely to attempts to preserve the longer history of the web's soundscapes.",Jeremy Wade Morris,Saving New Sounds: The Sonic Web (Part 3).,2018-04-30,https://www.flowjournal.org/2018/04/saving-new-sounds-2/,,,,Saving New Sounds: The Sonic Web (Part 3).,Flow Journal

But as the podcasting industry grows up and experiments with new forms of, and technologies for, advertising and monetization, the coherence of the audio file is more in question now than it ever has been. Should a database account for these multiple versions?",Jeremy Wade Morris,Saving New Sounds: Podcasts and Preservation,2018-02-26,https://www.flowjournal.org/2018/02/saving-new-sounds/,,,,Saving New Sounds: Podcasts and Preservation (Part 2),Flow Journal
16189,HAA-255979-17,"We are, as commentators have noted, in the midst of a ""Golden Age of Podcasts""; a moment where the choice for quality digital audio abounds, and where new voices and listeners connect daily through earbuds, car stereos, home speakers or office computers. Depending on how you define it, podcasting is either just over 10 years old, more than 20 years old, or merely the latest soundwave in radio's much longer history. [1] However you date it, in the decade since 2004 when the term ""podcasting"" was inadvertently coined the format has exploded: there are now over 300,000 podcasts and 8 million episodes in over 100 languages, with new ones launching every day. [2]  Given how ubiquitous and available podcasts are, you might assume they would not face the same preservation risks as, say, old radio tape reels, transcription discs or celluloid film stock. Podcasts are largely free and their near-instant availability on multiple devices makes them seem as if they are in endless supply. They take up relatively few megabytes, which makes it easy to store a lot of them, and they are often available through multiple channels and aggregators (iTunes, Stitcher, SoundCloud, etc.). But podcasts are surprisingly vulnerable; podcast feeds end abruptly, cease to be maintained, or become housed in proprietary databases, like iTunes, which are difficult to search with any rigor. Many podcasts get put behind paywalls as they get popular, or as back catalogues become a potential source of revenue. Then there's the precarity of the very platforms that help make up podcasting's diffuse and sometimes DIY infrastructure: I recently heard from an independent podcaster who had been hosting their show via the file management app/website Dropbox, but once that company made significant changes to its ""public folder"" feature, the podcaster was left scrambling to find another solution for where to host their files (and had to return to older shows to update the URLs and locations of new files).",Jeremy Wade Morris,Saving New Sounds: Podcasts and Preservation,2017-10-17,https://www.flowjournal.org/2017/10/saving-new-sounds-podcasts/,,,,Saving New Sounds: Podcasts and Preservation (Part 1),Flow Journal

17091,PW-264041-19,"Rhizomes of Mexican American Art since 1848 is, fundamentally, a decolonial strategy to make available the rich aesthetic and documentary history of art produced by and about Mexican America. Because Rhizomes will allow online users to search and interact with the holdings and collections of libraries, archives, and museums (LAM) across the United States, we depend upon relationships and technical connections. While these two types of linkages may appear equally significant, we privilege relationships. Whereas Digital Humanities scholars privilege technological sustainability (the robust nature of the tool, infrastructure, fixity, and interoperability), Rhizomes emphasizes relationships.There is no software or hardware solution for technological obsolescence that will support the ongoing function and growth of Rhizomes. Relationships between our team and our partner institutions will provide the foundation for sustainability.   With such relations and connections, Rhizomes can grow its deep, horizontal, and vertical roots. The protocol clarifies how we do this work and reflects why we are doing this work. Imagined as an alternative to Eurocentric, colonial, or siloed collections, Rhizomes depends upon decolonial methods for collaboration that emphasize equity, transparency, trust, and reciprocity.

In his official capacities at the International Student Service and at the High Commission for Refugees (Jewish and Other) Coming from Germany, Kotschnig became an important negotiator between the various ad hoc committees that formed to find positions for the hundreds of displaced German scholars, many of whom would come to the U.S. to re-establish their careers. When the German crisis became a continental crisis with the Anschluss of Austria in 1938, many of the procedures and relationships that Kotschnig had worked to establish through the committees became the framework for the relocation of émigré scholars whose careers were terminated by the Nazi regime on the basis of their political identity as socialists, communists, or liberals, or because of their ""racial"" identity as ""non-Aryans"" or Jews.",Joseph Malherek,,2019-12-16,/https://botstiberbiaas.org/Walter-Kotschnig-and-the-Scholar-Crisis/,,,,"Walter Kotschnig and the German Refugee Scholar Crisis, 1933–36",Botstiber Institute for Austrian-American Studies Blog

17291,FT-254705-17,"When I ask my college students to name a suffragist, most of them name Susan B. Anthony. Over a century after her death, many even recognize her picture. In 1979, she became the first woman whose portrait appeared on a circulating coin in the United States. A recent study by the National Women's History Museum reveals that many states require students to learn about her. Soon, the first statue of historical women in Central Park will feature Anthony and fellow reformers Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth.  How did Anthony's face become so visible? Anthony was one of many women's rights activists, but she was one of the few who dedicated her time to distributing portraits of reformers like herself. Anthony spent significant effort and money to mold the public image of the women's rights movement.   Anthony borrowed visual strategies from the antislavery reformers, especially from Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. Douglass and Truth sold their portraits to provide a model of black leadership that countered racist and sexist cartoons. Similarly, Anthony wanted to challenge cartoons that mocked female reformers. She distributed portraits to define the leaders of the movement and emphasize that women—especially well-off white women—could be public leaders, perhaps even president. Anthony's portraits established a model for female leadership and defined which suffragists we most often remember today.",Allison Lange,The Suff Buffs,2020-06-13,https://www.womensvote100.org/the-suff-buffs-blog/2020/4/21/how-susan-b-anthony-became-the-most-recognizable-suffragist,Link to blog post.,,,How Susan B.

17451,PW-253781-17,"Ruling over much of Macedonia starting with Antigonus I Monophthalmus (the ""One-Eyed"", r. 306–301 BC), the Antigonid dynasty of Hellenistic kings produced some of the most attractive and important coinages of the late 4 through 2 centuries BC. Curiously, however, Antigonid coinage has not attracted a great deal of concentrated scholarly attention since Edward T. Newell's work on it roughly a century ago. That situation now is rapidly changing as a number of Greek scholars, notably Sophia Kremydi, ANS Visiting Scholar in 2009, and Katerina Panagopoulou, have offered recent monographs on the coinages of selected Antigonid dynasts. Kremydi's 2018 volume, ‘Autonomous' Coinage under the Late Antigonids (Melethmata 79) provides up-to-date overviews of the coinages of Philip V (r. 221–179 BC) and Perseus (r. 179–168 BC), while Panagopoulou's about-to-be-published volume, The Early Antigonids: Coinage, Money, and the Economy (ANS 2020), looks closely at the coinage of Antigonus II Gonatas (r. 277–274; 272–239 BC).

But sometimes it requires more, as I experienced today when I was led on a chase through four medieval sources in three different languages (five if you count modern translations!) by my attempt to determine whether a ""chapel of St. John"" mentioned by a thirteenth-century Latin pilgrim might be the same as a ""church of St. John"" mentioned by a twelfth-century Syriac historian-patriarch.",Thomas A.

18187,RQ-249842-16,"2020 is unlikely to be recorded in the history books as a particularly fashionable year, as many of us have turned to neck-up ‘zoom-ready' looks, elasticated waistbands, and slippers for comfort. But it has been sartorially remarkable for the almost-overnight success of one formerly niche accessory: the mask. As countries mandate their use in public spaces to combat the spread of Covid-19, many of us have started to wear masks for the first time, and they have become an essential part of one's outfit. Choice of materials and maker has become important as consumers are chastised for their mask selection. Designers have capitalised on the opportunity to brand and monetise the public health crisis, while those of us with sewing skills have started cottage industry production lines to provide them for friends and family. Single use non-biodegradable masks are filling landfills by the billion, and the medical industry is asking us to reserve the highest quality of N-95 masks for healthcare professionals. Cloth masks with bright prints, beaded ties and even ruffled edges have become big business, and, you can turn to Vogue to discover the most stylish (and expensive) options on the market. Wearing – or not wearing – a mask is a political, medical, and ethical act, but it can also be a fashion statement. Masks might be ‘new' accessories in the wardrobes of this generation, but they have a long history.",Sophie Pitman,Refashioning the Renaissance Blog,2020-12-02,https://refashioningrenaissance.eu/the-renaissance-of-the-mask/,Blog post,,,The Renaissance of the Mask: from plague doctor beaks to velvet visards,Refashioning the Renaissance Blog

19675,PJ-50080-11,"The Republicans of Berkeley County once bemoaned how difficult it was to edit a political paper when ""the Republican backbone"" in Berkeley ""was weakened by Democratic domination."" This perceived difficulty did not prevent editors A. S. Goulden and John T. Reily from establishing the Martinsburg Herald in 1881. A thoroughly Republican paper, the Martinsburg Herald retained its original management until 1885, when Reily purchased Goulden's interest in the paper and associated himself with George F. Evans, a manufacturer of cigars and wholesale dealer in tobacco. In addition to being a Republican paper, the Martinsburg Herald was ""A Weekly Family Journal—Devoted to Home Interests, Local News, &amp;c."" It followed a fairly consistent format: the first page contained literature, the second political reports, the third local news, and the fourth advertisements.",Rachael Barbara Nicholas,The Martinsburg Herald,2021-03-01,https://news.lib.wvu.edu/2021/03/01/the-martinsburg-herald/,"West Virginia University News Blog promotes events and posts on historical topics written by the staff and curators of the West Virginia and Regional History Center, special collections at WVU.",,,The Martinsburg Herald,West Virginia University News Blog

Having recently emerged victorious in the Battle of Lewisburg and perhaps faced with the boredom of occupation, the soldiers set about publishing a newspaper they christened the Yankee.

19678,PJ-50080-11,"In her 1992 speech on the history of Juneteenth, given at the Washington Carver African American Arts Camp, Historian (and WVU alum) Dr. Ancella Bickley spoke of the impact of the Emancipation Proclamation in West Virginia. The Senatorial debate on the admission of West Virginia into the United States made clear that Statehood would not be granted if West Virginia did not make provisions for limiting or the outright abolition of the enslavement of African Americans in West Virginia. Waitman T. Willey introduced an amendment to the West Virginia Constitution, which was eventually approved by West Virginia voters, Congress, and then President Lincoln. The Willey Amendment established a gradual emancipation of some enslaved people in the soon-to-be state of West Virginia, rather than the complete abolition of slavery. Under the Willey Amendment, only enslaved people under the age of 25 would have been emancipated. This means West Virginians were enslaved until the Emancipation Proclamation and the State's adoption of the 13th Amendment on the 3rd of February 1865. Dr. Bickley recalls that enslaved people in West Virginia ""may not have been told of their freedom and like Mollie Gabe of Braxton County, continued in servitude until her mother sent her uncle to fetch her"".",Dr. Miriam Cady,,2021-06-19,https://news.lib.wvu.edu/2021/06/19/an-extensive-celebration-emancipation-day-and-juneteenth-in-west-virginia/,"The West Virginia University New Blog promotes events and posts on historical topics written by the staff and curators of the West Virginia and Regional History Center, special collections for WVU.",,,“An Extensive Celebration”: Emancipation Day and Juneteenth in West Virginia,West Virginia University News Blog
19680,PJ-50080-11,"With six broods of periodical cicadas covering almost the entire state, West Virginia certainly has its fair share of history with the cicadas. Every seventeen years like clockwork once the ground warms to 64° F eight inches underground, the cicadas begin to emerge, and given their predictability, newspapers publish articles warning and educating those within range of the incoming invasions.  One of my favorite newspaper articles comes from the Ceredo Advance in May 1911. In the article, the author, John E. Watkins, describes the oncoming emergence of not just one but two broods, one of the 17-year broods and one of the 13-year broods. He remarks on how he and everyone living in his time would never witness both broods emerge simultaneously again. While this emergence occurred mostly in New Jersey, it was interesting to see how the news made its way to West Virginia. After all, there's nothing like a cicada to get you to brood about your mortality.",Angela Spatafore,,2021-04-12,https://news.lib.wvu.edu/2021/04/12/the-cicadas-are-coming/,"The West Virginia University News Blog promotes events and historical topics written by staff and curators of the West Virginia and Regional history Center, special collections for WVU.",,,The Cicadas are Coming!,West Virginia University Library News Blog
19681,PJ-50080-11,"Since we are a week away from the anniversary of her birth (August 16, 1913), I'd like to celebrate Helen Louise (Froelich) Holt.  She was the wife of Rush Dew Holt, who was generally credited with being the youngest popularly elected senator in the U.S. Senate, and she was a very educated woman and a public servant in her own right.  The WVRHC houses a collection of her papers.   Helen Holt was more academically accomplished than most women of her day, and had a career in education before moving into politics.  She received an AA degree at Stephens College, and then a Bachelors degree and an MS in Zoology at Northwestern University by 1938.  (For contrast, only 4% of women in 1940 had completed four years of college.)  From 1938-1941, she taught science courses at National Park College.  According to an obituary, Mrs. Holt first attracted her future husband's attention when she was included in the February 12, 1940 issue of Life, where a photograph of her appeared as one of a selection of pretty schoolteachers.  The two-page spread was allegedly prompted by mass retaliation to a letter from a reader claiming that many schoolteachers were ugly.",Jane LaBarbara,,2021-08-09,https://news.lib.wvu.edu/2021/08/09/celebrating-helen-holt/,"The West Virginia University Library News Blog promotes events and posts on historical topics by staff and curators of the West Virginia and Regional History Center, special collections for WVU.",,,Celebrating Helen Holt,West Virginia University Library News Blog

19895,HAA-266462-19,"Abstract: This paper consists of three complementary parts. The first section describes three instances where very technical scholarship on Greek literature overlaps with, and draws attention to, particularly dramatic historical contexts. This section describes an aspect of Greco-Roman studies that is both too demanding and too narrow — too demanding because it assumes that anglophone researchers work with scholarship in languages such as French, German, and Italian, but too narrow because it does not engage with scholarship that is not in a major European language. The second section talks about the general need for Classics and Classical Studies in a country such as the United States to extend beyond Greece and Rome. This section builds on work that I have published in the past distinguishing Greco-Roman from Classical Studies. The third section describes a more concerted attempt to expand beyond North Africa and to include sources from Sub-Saharan Africa. I report on developing for a spring 2021 course on Epic Poetry a 10,000-line Mandinka/English corpus of stories produced by West African Griots. I will also briefly discuss the use of Classical Arabic to explore locally produced sources about West African history and culture. As a first step, the fall 2021 course on Classical historians at Tufts University will center not only on sources such as Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy and Tacitus but on two histories that focus on the Songhay Empire: the Tarikh al-Fattâsh, begun c. 1593 by Mahmud Kati, and the Tarikh as-Sudân, composed by al-Sadi (c. 1594–1655). This class will expand the role of Classical Arabic in Classical Studies at Tufts.",Gregory Crane,Thoughts on Classical Studies in the 21st Century United States,2021-09-10,https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/thoughts-on-classical-studies-in-the-21st-century-united-states/# ftn5,This is an essay series supported by Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies.,,,Thoughts on Classical Studies in the 21st Century United States,Center for Hellenic Studies: Classical Inquiries

20131,HT-261812-18,"The previous models developed for the Women Writers Vector Toolkit (WWVT) allow users only to interact with a corpora using single word queries. While useful, this approach does have limitations: for instance, in querying multi-word terms such as place names (""New York"") or concepts (""women's rights""). When a word embedding model is made using the wordVectors package, a textual corpus is tokenized into individual word-level units. Therefore, when the word embedding model is created, it forms a relational model between the words of a corpus, not phrases or concepts. After the first Word Vectors for the Thoughtful Humanist institute in 2019, the WWVT team sought to create expanded resources for scholars interested in word embedding models. One part of this project was to create a workflow that could provide opportunities to tokenize multiword strings in the word embedding models.",Juniper Johnson,Women Writers Project Blog,2021-04-21,https://wwp.northeastern.edu/blog/tokenization-word-embedding-models/,,,,Experiments in Tokenization for Word Embedding Models,Women Writers Project

20160,FB-55612-11,"The fall of 2016 was an interesting time to publish a book on the relationship between religion, identity, and politics. As we know, the United States elected a president in November who ran on an openly Islamophobic platform and who, within the first weeks of his administration, has made dramatic changes to American immigration policy.  Trump's election is part of a general 21st-century wave of resurgent nationalism, populism, militarism, and religious and ideological conflict that are responses to broader social and economic change. My book, Polemics and Patronage in the City of Victory, looks at a time and place quite removed from our contemporary lives: the South Indian empire of Vijayanagara in the early 1500s. But, not unlike recent reality, this empire was marked by high levels of immigration, foreign trade, a rapidly changing economy, and new patterns of religious, ethnic, and linguistic diversity.
