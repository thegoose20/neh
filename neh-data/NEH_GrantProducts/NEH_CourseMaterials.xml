		<Abstract>"The Intellectual Climate of Spain" is a laboratory where students will be gathering and organizing materials to create a prototype version of a software tool, Gnovis, for visualizing entities and the relationships between them in well-defined domains of knowledge. We will generate our own highly detailed dataset for a limited subset of Spanish Renaissance literature. This detailed example will help us understand the types of interface necessary to allow navigation through the many attributes and connections between the entities under consideration. In addition, the seminar will serve as a crucible for testing our ideas about developing different modes of visualization, and about the usefulness of including or excluding certain attributes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course compares and contrasts the respective "philosophies of mind" of the moderate realist Thomas Aquinas (ca. 1225-1274) and the nominalist John Buridan (ca. 1300-1361). Since Buridan knew, understood and respected, but respectfully disagreed with, Aquinas' doctrine, the discussions focus especially on Buridan's deviations from and criticisms of Aquinas' characteristic theses and arguments concerning the Aristotelian doctrine of the soul (such as the unity of substantial forms, the distinction of the powers of the soul, the co-formality of object and subject in intentional reception, the role of intelligible species in concept formation, the provability of the immateriality of the intellect, etc.) to find out exactly where Buridan's nominalist Aristotelianism parts company with Aquinas' consistent hylomorphism, why it does so, and whether with good reason. Also discussed is how Buridan's ideas prepared the ground for many recalcitrant dilemmas of modern philosophies of mind, quite justifiably invalidated by Aquinas' approach (dualism vs. materialism; freedom vs. determinism; representationalism vs. direct realism; externalism vs. internalism, etc.). The basic texts used are Aquinas' "Questions on the Soul" and "Commentary on Aristotle's De Anima", and the critical text and English translation of books II and III of Buridan's "Questions on Aristotle's De Anima", being prepared by an international team in the framework of an NEH-funded project (for more info, see: http://buridanica.org). While focusing primarily on the philosophical content, the course offers opportunities for students to experience in practice the work involved in the preparation of a critical text and translation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course is all about digital publishing, with a particular focus on digital media scholarship — a niche area of scholarly publishing that will allow us to focus on a lot of cutting-edge issues and concerns that relate to all kinds of publishing, both print and digital and linear and nonlinear. We will cover all of the following topics in perhaps random but always-overlapping ways:      scholarship, peer-review, metadata, open-access, globalization, copyright, creative commons, media, materiality, mode, database, distribution, Deep Web, labor, economy, funding models, sustainability, workflow, reading patterns, research, reader tools, accessibility, usability, Internet, Web, HTML, XML, Dublin Core, FTP, online communication, open-source, Open Journal Systems, OAI-PMH, rhetoric, technology, pedagogy  Our main project will be to work on creating metadata for an actual publication, Kairos (the scholarly journal I edit), which recently won a $50,000 NEH grant to build a new content-management system for similar publication venues. One of the most important parts of this new CMS will be the journal's ability to offer robust metadata for readers, librarians, etc. But we need to build the metadata so they will come. This project is resume-worthy, so get your metadata hats on!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Fort Caspar Museum hosted a TEacher Workshop series in six classes during the month of April. FCM collaborated with the American History Cowbody Coalition (AHCC) with the Natrona County School District and the Western History Center (WHC) at Casper College. Drawing on inspiration from the exhibit, the workshop focused on strengthening knowledge of local history sources, agricultural and community history, demonstrating the basic principles of oral history as a primary source, strategies for conducting oral histories, and developing lessons that build on content knowledge through oral history.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The AHCC arranged for two graduate credits through Adams State College in Colorado or credits with the Professional Training Standards Board in Wyoming. This workshop was open to K-12 teachers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project consists of particular episodes in the environmental history of two Washington cities: Seattle and Spokane. The project divides into four sections, each exploring particular facets of city's history. These sections may be taught together as a unit, or used separately as individual lessons. Questions and teaching suggestions accompany each section, as well as more general activities at the end of the essay. A proper name and subject index is included as a finding aid. A timeline provides important dates in the environmental history of Washington and the Pacific Northwest. Finally, the project includes a bibliography, suggested videos, and on-line resources that teachers may consult for further information.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Martin Heidegger's Being and Time proposes a holistic conception of truth that can reconnect epistemology with cultural practices and social institutions. Yet his conception seems to make personal or communal "authenticity" the key to attaining truth. The seminar develops a constructive critique of Heidegger's conception of truth by examining its internal logic and its hermeneutical role.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A growing area of interest in the digital humanities is the mobile environment, especially projects that take advantage of the affordances of smart phones and tablets. This course, derived from the Mobile Tech Research Initiative of The Creative Media &amp;amp; Digital Culture Program at Washington State University Vancouver (http://van-dtc356.vancouver.wsu.edu/appcamp/), is aimed at assisting participants to: 1) conceptualize the space and special features of mobile devices; 2) develop the architecture, design, and multimedia content production for a mobile project; and 3) understand the coding and programming requirements for mobile devices. By the end of the course, participants will have the information they need for creating projects for the mobile environment and will have completed steps toward the development of their own projects</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course will investigate a number of hyperintensional concepts that have been at the center of much recent discussion in metaphysics, such as the notions of grounding, ontological dependence, metaphysical explanation, metaphysical fundamentality, reducibility, and real definition. We are planning to strike a balance between giving an overview of recent philosophical developments and talking about our own work in progress. We will begin the semester with a discussion of recent work on grounding, followed by a detailed look at a number of more specific question about the grounding relation, e.g. about its formal properties, whether facts about grounding are fundamental, and the relationship between grounding and real definition. Next, we will focus on a specific question about fundamental reality, namely whether all fundamental facts are qualitative, or whether they include facts about which specific individuals exist and how the different qualitative roles are distributed over them. We will consider the commitments, attractions and drawbacks of different possible positions on this issue. This discussion will illustrate the connections between fundamentality and reduction on the one hand and supervenience on the other. That, in turn, will serve as an introduction to our next topic: the connection between hyperintensional and modal notions. Most likely, we will discuss the thesis—propounded by Kit Fine, among others—that modal distinctions can be explained in terms of essence. We will end the seminar by looking briefly at a few other hyperintensional notions, such as truth-making and constitution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Face-to-face interaction in multimodal contexts involves the integration of linguistic constructions, voice qualities, gestures and gesticulation, eye gaze, as well as other embodied actions relevant to the ongoing discourse.  Cross-cultural and cross-linguistic comparison of talk in interaction raises methodological concerns about just what is comparable across different ethnographic contexts, as well as what means researchers have to recognize actions as socially relevant to the flow of discourse when our own speaker-intuitions are not a viable source of knowledge.  In this course we will survey theoretical literature on multimodal interaction and cross-cultural conversation analysis, and build analytical skills working with video data through a focus on less-commonly studied languages recorded in their natural discourse settings.  Skills will involve tools for video editing, transcription, and the discourse coding of both verbal and non-verbal semiotic actions.  Laboratory "data sessions" will be conducted throughout the term in which class participants will hone analytical skills through the formulation and testing of hypotheses grounded in the turn-by-turn sequences of the transcribed video data.  Requirements are engagement of course readings, active participation in class discussions and data sessions, write-ups of data session findings, and a term project that can involve a student's own data or data from archived sources.  This course provides you with tools and experience working with interaction data different from your own language and culture and methods for productive comparison across the typological and cultural variability of the world's languages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dante Alighieri may not have invented Hell but he created the most powerful and enduring vision of the underworld as a place of eternal punishment for lost souls in the afterlife. This course takes you on a journey down through the nine circles of Hell presented in Dante's Inferno. "Danteworlds," a book and award-winning Web site created here at UT, will help guide you by portraying infernal creatures and scenes and by explaining the medieval poem's vast array of references to religion, philosophy, history, politics, and other works of literature. Along the way, you will encounter adaptations and echoes of Dante's Inferno in selected literary, artistic, cinematic, and popular works, ranging from Sandro Botticelli's illustrations, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and a silent Inferno film to T. S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," Vincent Ward's What Dreams May Come, and Dante-inspired music and video games.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Summarizing Dante's popularity in Italy in the early twentieth century, one critic amusingly observed that the medieval poet "was cooked in every sauce, served hot and cold, grilled and in gelatin, whole and ground, alone or with sides, with critical mayonnaise and historical croutons: there was something for all tastes, for strong stomachs and for dyspeptic ones, for women and for men, for kindergartners and for doddering academics." In this course we will seek intellectual nourishment at the banquet of Dante's legacy by closely examining a broad range of responses to the poet—the man and his works—from Giovanni Boccaccio's biography in the late Middle Ages to Roberto Benigni's recent performances of TuttoDante. Between the Dante-inspired works of Boccaccio and Benigni, we will study various, often conflicting, versions of "Dante" in literature, art, film, politics, history, and popular culture. After establishing a foundation for Dante's influence by discussing his political treatise (Monarchia) and selected cantos of his Commedia (most from Inferno), we will embark on an interpretive journey tracing Dante's evolution from a regional to a national (then nationalist) figure before he attained the global status he enjoys today. Giuseppe Mazzini famously called Dante—Ugo Foscolo's "Ghibelline fugitive"—the "Prophet of the Italian Nation": we will accordingly examine appeals to Dante's authority in promoting the liberation and unification of Italy, but we will also consider his role as a beacon of liberty in the United States. Among other areas of inquiry, we will discuss Catholic interpretations of Dante as a neo-Guelph advocate of papal political power, nationalist appropriations of the poet for territorial expansion and military interventions, and recent representations of Dante as an icon of Italian culture on the world stage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The attached Interpretive Plan has been created to serve as one of the primary training tools for interpreters whose job it is to communicate the history of Montgomery Place to the visiting public.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Like most historic sites, Montgomery Place has the potential for exploring many different themes or points in time and for using different methods to convey that information. However, a particular set of themes and methods has been established for Montgomery Place and it is essential that all interpretation should present a consistent message to the visitor. The Interpretive Plan is designed to explain the themes and background information for each area, or station, of the museum. The Interpretive Plan also states the desired learner outcomes (DLOs) we hope will be achieved by visitors at each station, and, where the experience is interpreter-guided as opposed to self-guided, provides suggestions for visitor participation opportunities (VPOs) and dialogue&amp;#x0D; questions in some of the stations.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Interpretive Plan does not attempt to cover all the information that is needed for the effective presentation of Montgomery Place's themes. Instead, it is one component among several training documents and resources that are important for a thorough understanding of the site and each of its areas.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Many people helped in the creation of the Installation Plan, in particular Kathleen Eagen Johnson and Jessa J. Krick. We gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This Installation Plan for Montgomery Place focuses on rooms and spaces that will be interpreted as part of the mansion tour. The Installation Plan works in conjunction with the Interpretive Plan. It does not attempt to cover all the information that is needed for the effective presentation of Montgomery Place's themes. Instead, it is one component among several training documents and resources that are important for a thorough&amp;#x0D; understanding of the site and each of its areas. The photographs included suggest the general atmosphere of the mansion's interiors and represent many of the objects on display. For a complete list of objects installed in each room, as well as complete documentary photography, see the corresponding set of Montgomery Place Object Information Books.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Installation Plan also contains information about the sixteen interpretive panels&amp;#x0D; installed throughout the Montgomery Place landscape.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Many people helped in the creation of the Installation Plan, in particular Margaret L. Vetare and Jessa J. Krick. We gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The monk, the poet, the neuroscientist, the constitutional lawyer—all hear the question what does prayer do from their own perspectives. Students will approach this enduring question from multiple disciplinary perspectives, including theology, philosophy, religious studies, medicine, the social sciences, law, and the arts. Readings will be chosen from major wisdom traditions, with some emphasis on Christian examples. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Course Description:&amp;#x0D; Digital technologies are cultural constructs and therefore can be purposefully used to transform our methods of relating and transmitting humanities content and culture to our audiences and to future generations. Instead of allowing digital technologies to shape our cultures and identity, we can shape our digital tools to better preserve, present, inform, and sustain our cultural heritages...the Software Applications for the Digital Humanities Special Topics course will introduce students to the use of emerging digital technologies in the archiving and presentation/display of cultural, visual, material, and intellectual property. Students will explore innovative ways in which digital technologies can be adapted to interact with cultural objects, such as creating condition reports of the objects. This course will engage key humanities content areas, including conservation, archives, Native American studies, and museum history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A syllabus for a freshman seminar on philosophical views on the "good life." There is no question more important to us than the question of how we should live, or the question of the good life. Everything we do, however grand or petty, ultimately stems from our answer to the question of the good life. Yet if the question of the good life is the most basic of practical questions, it still rests on prior conceptions, or answers to prior questions—and one question perhaps more than any other: what is the fundamental character of the world?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course, INDIG 4XX, functions as a culminating thematic course that complements, complicates and deepens previous courses taken in the NAIS Program. Additional pre-requisites ensure that students are prepared to engage with complex analysis and critical research essay writing formats. Placed in the fourth year, the course is the final "examination" of themes and community/research processes explored throughout the NAIS curriculum. The seminar format of this course limits the number of students to ensure full and deep engagement with the teaching and learning opportunities. True to the format of the FOUR KEY NAIS courses, INTEGRATING INDIGENOUS IDENTITIES (NAIS 4XX) will incorporate and interconnect both intergenerational research and community internships with major course themes. The course will be taught through a collaborative teaching model the goal of which is to enlist our NAIS Advisory Board members* to continue to work with our faculty in a reciprocal teaching and learning context.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course explores indigenous women through the lens of gender, which is not defined biologically, but instead is shaped through social roles, political rules, and community expectations. It identifies the ways in which indigenous women's' personal and political experiences continue to impact agency and empowerment in both their personal and public lives. Course materials will explore historical and contemporary perspectives through Native American and Latino/a authors and scholars, as well as &amp;#x0D; others, as the professor's expertise and research allows. The primary focus, however, is on indigenous communities of Native North American/Canadian tribal groups, and Central and South American tribal/community groups.</Abstract>

As the outcomes indicate, students will be trained in critical areas of "museum management" honing entry level transferable skills welcome in any museum environment and/or applicable to special projects in cultural center environments. &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

My "Foundations of Civilization" course focuses on the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim worlds of the medieval Mediterranean.&amp;#x0D; Thanks to my archival research, I can give more nuanced lectures about border regions of the Christian-ruled and Muslim world realms. I can also show students fascinating pictures of manuscripts with Greek, Latin, and Arabic signatures - a perfect example of the mixing of cultures.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Pacifica Black is focused on the Black Diaspora in the Southern Pacific, particularly across Australia, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Fiji and New Caledonia. It is an extension of a 2014 National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for University Faculty, in which Professor Quito Swan conducted extensive research in the region. The Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean have historically been in constant political dialogue. Movements for Black Power, sovereignty, decolonization, land rights, self-determination, women's rights, environmental justice and indigenous culture critically impacted the South Pacific. Yet, this class is not simply about Blacks in the South Pacific. Pacifica Black asks what happens when we centralize—as opposed to marginalize—the Black Pacific experience in how we study the African Diaspora? And if we take the Pacific as a Diasporic "starting place," major crossroads or "hub," how does that impact how we view the global black experience, historically speaking and in the contemporary world? Even still, when we comparatively think from the archipelagoes of the Pacific, it puts us in direct conversation with the politics and cultural experience of the Caribbean and Indian Ocean worlds. As such, this class will explore the wider African Diaspora experience but thru the lens of the South Pacific ideas, worldviews and experiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course is not a history of the book. It does not follow the epic parade of culture from alphabet to quill, printing press to keyboard. The story we tell here is in the elegiac mode: how cultures failed and their artifacts disappeared, how fabled texts and records were lost and forgotten, and how, with effort and ingenuity, a paltry few were clawed back from oblivion. From Europe to the Middle East, Asia to Latin America, an unsung group of scholars, adventurers, scientists, and rogues trekked across deserts and over mountains, plundered tombs and monasteries, rummaged between the legs of mummies, entered hidden caves and bricked up rooms, deciphered lost languages, and developed new technologies all so as to recover for the world a group of texts that would change the history of the past. That is if anyone actually bothered to read them.  Here is the history of the hidden canon, great yet little-known books drawn from far-flung collections: Monte Cassino, Verona, Herculaneum, the Fayum, Dura Europos, Ras Sharma, St. Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai, the Cairo Genizah, the Qumran caves, Khotan, Dun Huang, Chichen Itza, and Guatemala City. Its cast of characters includes the famous, the flamboyant, and the obscure: Petrarch, Poggio, Flinders Petrie, Grenville and Hunt, Solomon Schechter, Marcus Aurelius Stein, Zelia Nutall, Brasseur, Alexander von Humboldt, Konstantin Tischendorf, the Smith sisters. Because the territory this course covers is large, the format will be lecture and exam. In a companion course, Reading the Hidden Canon, students will consult excerpts from the most important documents and pieces of literature these scholars recovered, many still largely unknown.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Image, Text and Technology is an interdisciplinary course in the history of the book as a textual and visual medium, an artistic object, and a technology of communication. Beginning with Aristotle's insight that we think in images, we will consider writing as bound up in a theoretical relationship with seeing (aesthetics), perceiving (phenomenology), and historically with technologies of dissemination, both analog and digital (manuscripts, printing, photography, television, the internet). We will explore the limits and conjunctions of visual and verbal media through theoretical and scientific readings in Plato, Lessing, Benjamin, Derrida, and McLuhan, and primary texts including the Bible, and the Precepts of Ptah Hotep..</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bringing together textual and artistic traditions at the inception of the Italian Renaissance, this course will examine closely key illuminated Italian manuscripts of the 14th century – The Thompson Divine Comedy in the British Library, Petrarch's Vergil in the Ambrosiana Library of Milan, the holograph copy of Petrarch's Rime Sparse (Vatican 3195), and Boccaccio's Dante in the Riccardiana Library of Florence (Ms. 1035) – as the cornerstones of Italian high culture. Our focus will be on the way these manuscripts, and the authors and artists who created them, construct notions of aesthetic space and narrative time. Supplementing primary readings in Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, will be secondary theoretical readings by Cennini, Vasari, Alberti, Lessing, and Camille. Beyond literature and art, this course will also consider the problems of conservation of medieval manuscripts and early books, and their availability for a larger audience with the employment of digital technologies. The broad objective of the course is to give students a material appreciation and interdisciplinary knowledge of the sources of Italian medieval and Renaissance culture and their relevance for Humanities and Science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>If one of the goals of the archaeologist is to interpret the ancient landscape as seen through the eyes of past peoples, we must employ the new tools offered by digital technologies, such as 3D imaging, to imagine and recreate what those ancient people might visually have perceived. Yale is increasingly employing new technologies of computer graphics to support current research in archaeology and anthropology. Students will learn, both theoretically and practically, the basics of these techniques and how these are supporting on-going archaeological expeditions and museum collections. Foundational to the course will be the interpretation of epigraphic and archaeological material within the broader context of landscape, by means of creating a virtual model to reconstruct the sensory experiences of the ancient peoples who created those sites.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This module is an exploration of the social and cultural history of Brazil with a focus on Black women and gendered forms of anti-blackness within popular culture. Under stereotypical depictions as maids, wet nurses, exotic mulattas, or prostitutes, Black Brazilian women are subject to controlling images that racialize, hypersexualize, and objectify their features and bodies alongside a nationalist discourse of Brazil as a colorblind utopia. By examining the place of Black women vis-à-vis Brazilian hierarchy and social practice, the module will address how Black women negotiate, challenge, and resist these misrepresentations through artistic, community, and political expression.

		<Abstract>Course Overview  The AAT Curriculum sees the proper study of American history as the centerpiece in the making of citizens, and the cultivation of an informed and reflective love of country. Because Americans are linked together not by blood and soil, but by the principles and history we share, it is essential that these things be passed down. This is one of the central tasks of education, and we cannot afford to fail in it. Instructional Units  The Instructional Units for US History are built using evidenced based practices that require students to actively engage with primary and secondary sources. Teachers are provided thematic units that trace historical content chronologically aligned with the textbook Land of Hope by Wilfred McClay (2019).  Each unit has a pacing guide (recommended number of days and time needed per lesson), an instructional sequence, plus a complete set of teacher materials with sample student materials. Teacher materials include: essential vocabulary words to help at risk readers access the text, selected original sources, close analytic and critical reading guidelines for text based materials, timeline activities with images, discussion guides for selected topics in each unit, note-taking strategies, and assignments designed to develop writing historical narrative and arguments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ENGL 1B is a writing course that focuses on argumentation and analysis. Students will approach argument from an historical perspective. Through the study of literary, rhetorical, and professional texts, you will be introduced to different theories from ancient times to the twenty-first century. You will also learn how to apply this literacy to write persuasively in different rhetorical situations. You will learn to write arguments using the logical, ethical, and emotional strategies of classical Greece, the theological and socio-cultural techniques of the Middle Ages, the courtly and political strategies of the Renaissance, the psychological and gendered techniques of the Enlightenment, the negotiation and collaborative strategies of the twentieth century, and the stylistic and grammatical structures of the twenty-first century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this course, students will be asked to consider their own research interests in light of the goals and values of patients. End-of-life issues accomplish this task uniquely, because our ability to manage symptoms has far outpaced our ability to cure disease. How should we regard the wishes of patients who are chronically sick, slowly losing cognitive function, or even terminally ill? If the confrontation with one's own mortality is, to a large degree, a personal issue, then how should we understand patient pain and suffering? While it is true that end-of life issues raise significant questions about the purpose and limits of scientific research, they also introduce equally important questions about what we can claim ethically about someone else's confrontation with mortality. For this reason, students will be challenged to move beyond both dogmatic scientific claims and abstract ethical arguments. They will also be tasked with learning some digital tools (e.g. Wordpress, Omeka, or Tableau) that they can use to present and publish their semester-long research projects in a database of student work on Bioethics. This includes becoming proficient in the ethics of digital publishing and in strategies for developing a scholarly portfolio. (3)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Entity annotation concerns the annotation of referring expressions in a text, i.e. spans of text that refer to things in the world, and their classification into entity types. The purpose of entity annotation in Coptic Scriptorium is to facilitate searches which include specific entity types (e.g. finding a certain epithet using linguistic annotations, such as ????? ‘holy', but only when applied to a PERSON), to inventorize entities (find all cases of e.g. places mentioned in the Apophthegmata Patrum), and to function as a gateway for entity linking, enabling searches for specific persons ("John the Baptist"), regardless of the exact expression used to mention them. The latter task of entity linking is left outside of the scope of the current guidelines.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar introduces students to how we learn about people in the past through the use of archival documents. Working with digital copies of documents from the colonial Spanish archives in Spain, Guatemala, and Honduras, we will "read over the shoulder" of the writers whose words form one of our most immediate links to Spanish colonial Honduran life. Students will learn how to locate archival documents online; how to read colonial handwriting; and how we can begin to understand more about society from even brief documents.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Upper-division course in Digital Humanities for English Department, Data Analytics Certificate, and Future DH Minor  For newspapers, social media, product reviews, and poetry, text is the medium of meaning. But its unstructured format demands unique strategies for bringing order to chaos: discovering general information, identifying distinctive details, recognizing topics or themes, and evaluating sentiment. In this project-based course, students will use tools and methods of data analysis to ask questions about texts and communicate the answers. Students will learn progressively complex applications of text data mining to understand the information that can be found within sets of documents. With special emphasis on literary texts, the course will also discuss and provide opportunities to study the relevance of text mining to fields like public health, business, science, and security.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course introduces students to the field of public history through the study of Asian-American experiences and narratives of immigration, ethnic identity, community and social movement formation, political citizenship, cultural traditions, economic and labor patterns, and popular culture. Public history broadly studies the preservation, interpretation, and (re-)presentation of historical narratives in public spaces such as museums, multi-media (films, tv series, music, theater/art), memorials, popular literature and non-fiction, genealogy projects, historically- themed content for children, and commercial use of historical themes or narratives (ads, theme parks, etc.). As a collaborative discussion and workshop-based course, students should expect a Seminar-style classroom experience enriched by guest speakers/participants from campus and Bay Area communities and field trips to historic sites, museums, community institutions, or food/culture experiences. In addition, the second half of each on-campus meeting will be dedicated to workshops on the theory and practice of public history, in which students will bring their individual community engagement experiences to the final class project of creating and presenting a small public history exhibit on campus that showcases both their classroom learning and experiential observation and application.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The History Mentors course is a .25 designed as a Community Engagement class is to train our students to engage in teaching and outreach to local primary and secondary school students who will be participating in the annual National History Day competition hosted each year in March by SMC. Students will first learn pedagogical techniques to assist elementary and secondary students in conducting historical research and in creating a formal display of their projects. SMC students will be paired with local participating schools, offer research mentorship at the local schools, meet students on the SMC campus and guide them in doing research in our own library, and participate as a judge on National History Day. The bulk of the class will take place during the Fall semester with the additional work as a judge the following March. Based on the FYAC time-structure model this class—which has most of its time obligations in the fall and some limited time requirements for the spring is a Fall-Spring sequence for a total of one .25 unit class.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course will be a study of the modern uses of the medieval past. Medievalism has been defined as "the ongoing process of recreating, reinventing and reenacting medieval culture in postmedieval times" (Elizabeth Emery and Richard Utz, eds., Medievalism: Key Critical Terms, Cambridge: 2017, p. 2). The topic is very much to the fore in contemporary culture and has even entered the political arena with the controversy over some extremist groups use of medieval themes and imagery. We will explore this and the many uses of medievalism today. A central focus of the course, moreover, will be to study several Bay Area churches for a profile of the elements of medieval art and architecture employed in their making and to share our findings with the custodians of those churches. The latter component of the course will fulfill the Community Engagement component of the Core Curriculum.</Abstract>

It is an introductory course and will take a broad view of the manuscript arts from the origins of Islam in the seventh century through the early modern period (eighteenth and nineteenth centuries), encompassing Arab, Persian, Turkish, and Indian cultures. The course will focus primarily on materials (binding and paper), layout, scripts, and decoration and will be taught through the rich collection of Islamic manuscripts that make up the Manuscripts of the Muslim World project. Students may expect to do some small group or individual work on their own in preparation for each synchronous class session.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Even before Marisa Duarte's Network Sovereignty: Building the Internet across Indian Country (2017) was published, Indigenous peoples have had a long and enduring history of creating and accessing different technologies (such as wampum belts, birch bark scrolls, ledger books, and buffalo hides) in order to chronicle Native ways of being and knowing in the world. In the midst of a global pandemic, this course will make use of remote teaching platforms and Indigenous epistemologies to offer a brief introduction to Native North American engagement with books as authors, editors, printers, publishers, and consumers. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, students will consider how settler colonialism has operated as an enduring structure, and not a one-time event, in both the U.S. and Canada with particular respect to the history of the Native book. By engaging with materials from Amherst College's Kim-Wait/Eisenberg Native American Literature and History collection, alongside scholarship from Native American and Indigenous studies, students will deepen their understandings not only of Native nations' and Native intellectuals' relationships to book history and various writing technologies but also of how Native Books provide guidance for critical engagement with settler colonial theory, literary studies, and cultural history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course offers a broad overview of the history and culture of the book in Tibet. Participants will discuss what is meant by "the book" in Tibetan culture and explore how books fit into the larger material, religious, and intellectual cultures of Tibet. The course will focus on major periods and developments in the history of Tibetan manuscript and print cultures, the physical materials and process of making Tibetan books, and the book within Tibetan religious and scholarly culture. Early source materials, such as epigraphy and Tibetan manuscripts from the "library cave" of Dunhuang (pre-twelfth century CE), as well as the continuing importance of manuscript production in Tibet will be considered. Students will also trace the development of Tibetan woodblock printing, from the Yuan dynasty-era (1279–1368) books known as "Mongolian prints" (hor par ma) to the eighteenth-century editions of the Tibetan Buddhist Canon. The end of the course will briefly touch on contemporary Tibetan publishing, both print and digital.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course is an introduction to aesthetics, the philosophical study of beauty. Specifically, we will examine beauty's relationship to the political sphere. We will begin by examining some theories of aesthetic judgment, before turning to look at the relationship between art and politics, the way art is central in both propaganda and protest, and how we make sense of art's relationship to political power. In particular we look at aesthetic movements such as the Black Arts Movement (BAM), the Chicano movement, and others to evaluate how aesthetic judgment relates to political judgment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course examines the history and culture of Chicago through the experiences of ordinary people of all races and backgrounds who have lived and worked here. How did Chicago go from a minor outpost on the frontier to a major metropolis? What social and cultural conditions inspired Chicago's great artists, writers, and activists, and how did those individuals drive the events that define the city's past? What made Chicago into a cradle of progressivism, home to racial and social justice movements that have inspired the nation and the world? These and other questions inform our study of the "City of Big Shoulders."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course engages with the following fundamental questions: What is the meaning of life (and death)? What is the value of life? How do we define death? What aspects of our humanity are visible in how we confront life's temporal limitations? Students in this course apply philosophical theories to humanistic exemplars from history, art, and literature. They do this through a variety of student-centered activities, close readings of texts, and in-class debates. In particular they are called to reflect on their own experiences and encounters with birth, life, and death, grappling with the status of both our natality and our mortality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>apanese woodblock prints and illustrated books from the seventeenth through the twentieth century are celebrated for their high technical and aesthetic achievements. In this course we will look closely at both formats, putting these into their historical and cultural contexts. We will also think through how these materials were designed for their broad and largely literate audiences. By engaging a wide range of materials, we will consider how the goals for printed materials varied from transferring information to delineating artistic trends. Among the topics we'll study are: the early forms of woodblock printing; the development of full-color multiple block printing; popular subjects, from kabuki actors to erotica; the book as medium of transfer of painting practices; and the role of tradition in a modern world.  In considering this larger world of print, we will seek to understand how savvy publishers provoked and sated the appetites of their audiences by marketing writers and illustrators—along with many of their subjects—as brand names, even turning some into celebrities. These multi-market publishing ventures appeared as both inexpensive diversions, to be consumed and discarded, while others were designed for elite audiences, using high quality materials, techniques, and references. Publishers also dabbled in job printing in the form of producing high end works on commission for poetry groups, fan clubs, and others. In the modern era, these practices of the past were adapted by publishers, artists, and writers to serve their new markets. As we shall see, some projects reinscribed the bounds of traditional culture while others embraced the broader range of representation offered by an international art world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a course on conceptualizing and curating digital cultural memory, with a particular focus on the construction of identities and expression of possible worlds, and on power, agency, and liberation in/through the independent "philosophical structures" of community-based archives. Among our animating concerns will be Afrofuturist and speculative digital library interface provocations; indigenous and local knowledges and their relation to nonlinear conceptions of time and "the record;" opportunities for place-based inquiry and understanding through archival collections; issues of sustainability; and problems of surveillance culture, hyper-quantification, and consent. We will also consider the challenges that established memory institutions and professionalized libraries and archives face when working in community. Under what conditions are authentic and equitable partnerships possible? What does good stewardship (or scholarship) mean in a post-custodial and collaborative context? How might digital platforms be better designed to protect their users, foster imagination, and honor local expertise and control? And finally, because this is a Rare Book School course, we'll pay close attention to the ways that even born-digital and digitally remediated collections are really material culture through and through: expressions of lived experience, deeply embodied and interpenetrating with physical spaces, documents, and artifacts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Florida has a deep connection to Black history that is often left at the margins of historical representations or ignored completely. As Marvin Dunn notes in his book A History of Florida Through Black Eyes, "people of African  descent have been major players in almost every significant event in the history of Florida from the arrival  of the conquistadors to the launch of the space shuttle…[and yet] [g]enerations of African Americans in  Florida [and most other Americans] have been denied our history. That is an intellectual crime." (x-xii). If colonial thought represents those Americans worth representing as white, European and male, then decolonizing representations means that the representations not only include people of color and women but include them in ways that highlight their achievements and not only their oppression; it also means that the classroom and learning experiences go beyond the written word.  In order to decolonize representations, students must uncover underrepresented histories and learn the tools to represent otherwise. The course will cover some of the stories of African descendants in Florida including creating the first independent towns in the United States, Black Seminoles and other freedom fighters, racial terrorism during and beyond reconstruction, Black joy and celebration at Paradise Park, Black leaders in music, civil rights, medicine, business and politics.  This course is meant to offer the insights and the skills into interpreting representations of Blacks in Florida through learning the methods of archival research, interviewing, analysis, digital production, and public exhibition with a feminist, decolonial lens. The course is divided into three modules: 1. Black histories, 2. Research on Black experiences and expressions of the present, and 3. Creating museum exhibits and K-12 classroom curricula for Black futures.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>The resources on this page – drawn from the archived letters of William Livingston and his family, John Kean and Susan Livingston Kean Nemciewicz, and Liberty Hall more broadly – allow for the exploration of a range of facets related to the history of the institution of slavery and the experiences of the enslaved in Revolutionary era America.

	While efforts to reconstruct the history of the enslaved at Liberty Hall are ongoing there is much work to be done before we will fully understand their lives and labor. The sources we do have must be used carefully as they are all from the perspective of white slaveholders. The Livingston family and Liberty Hall from the period of 1772-1790 provides an example of slavery in the north and the impact and limits of revolutionary ideas and rhetoric with regard to the institution of slavery. Recapturing this history is essential to understanding the institution of slavery and its impact, nationally, regionally, and locally.

		<Abstract>What if we could climb into historical views of cities and experience the worlds they represent? How could we design digital methods and tools that reconstruct historical images like these in 3D even if they don't correspond to modern ideas about mathematical perspective or gridded Cartesian space?  For several decades, scholars of historical cartography have heeded the call to "deconstruct the map"— to treat maps not as representations of the world as it was but as texts, which employ symbols, rhetoric and silences to make arguments about the world as the mapmaker wants it to be seen. Meanwhile, historians, literary scholars and others have applied computational analytics and machine learning to raise new questions about texts through techniques like text mining, XML encoding and data analytics. Bringing these two insights together, how might we "read" maps computationally without altering them to fit the constraints of machine readability?   This course, laid the foundations for students to begin to answer these questions, with a critical focus on the maps, views, and plans of medieval and early modern London and Lisbon. It offered an introduction to materials in the history and theory of cartography, medieval and early modern urbanization, and research methods in history, art history, architectural history and others, as well as critical approaches to digital mapping, procedures of map annotation and markup, Python-based techniques for importing markup data and procedural modeling (Houdini), incorporation of those data into an interactive 3D environment (Unreal), and preliminary analysis of these findings. Students helped troubleshoot and develop the project workflow as well by using this process to research, markup, and analyze their own map drawn from medieval or early modern European and European colonial history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How do we process language and intention? What patterns and strategies are employed by readers and writers across disciplines to effectively give or exchange information with different audiences? This course approaches these questions from the perspective that writing well and communicating productively is of paramount importance in the professional world. Feedback from Fortune 500 executives lament the lack of candidates possessing the "soft skills" invaluable to the 21st-century workforce, a workforce where the static, stable skill sets from the past no longer apply in our dynamically changing global economic and cultural landscape. Being "future proof" today means being able to critically and thoughtfully react to unknown and unfamiliar contexts and to reinvent and reimagine our thinking on the fly; this kind of work is what work itself is becoming. Given these high-stakes writing expectations, it's understandable that some anxiety may linger, even amongst students closing in on graduation, around what it really means to learn to write with an effective style. By pairing a deliberate, technical examination of English language syntax with an applied, productive practice of rhetorical theory, English 4305 will help students become more confident in both their understanding of how the English language functions and their abilities to compose with that language to meet myriad rhetorical purposes. After completing a series of modules focused on specific syntactical patterns and rhetorical strategies, students will apply these refined skills to two practical, professionally oriented analytical projects, thereby empowering them to feel better prepared to start their chosen careers. Thus, students from all departments will benefit from this course's focused, upper-division study of some of the more technical aspects English language structure and usage, and how this language actually gets applied to critical thinking and writing in the real-world disciplines they are pre</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Humanists and social scientists have increasingly engaged the affordances of digital visualization for managing, interrogating, connecting, and presenting a wide array of three-dimensional objects in three-dimensional spatial contexts. This course centers on how digital technologies for various forms of spatial thinking, modeling, and visualizing offer both powerful forensic tools and effective forms of public communication. Using as a starting point the current research trajectory of investigations in the ancient Greek Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace, this course aims to acquaint students with the fundamental digital tools of spatial analysis and offer the opportunity to work directly with each technology. A key objective is to enable students to make knowledgeable choices about which strategies and technologies most effectively address particular research or visualization questions. An emphasis on both acquired skills sets and their informed deployment will effectively prepare students to frame research questions visually and present Humanities scholarship to public audiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this seminar we will use the Sanctuary of the Great Gods as a backdrop for investigating how artistic and architectural innovations—engendered by political, social, and religious changes that followed the death of Alexander the Great—were deployed in the service of sacred experience in the Hellenistic period. The fame of the windswept, mile-high island of Samothrace in the northeastern Aegean emanated from its mystery cult of the Great Gods, whose rites of initiation promised protection at sea and the opportunity to "become a better and more pious person in all ways" (Diodorus).  Although the rites were kept secret, we can gain a purchase on their transformative power through the comments of ancient authors, the lists of initiates who left their names in the sanctuary, the innovative architecture that sheltered the rituals, the splendid dedications offered to the Gods, and the humble but crucial detritus of cult—pottery and animal bones—that built up over centuries of use spanning from the 7th century BC to the 4th century AD.  The Sanctuary of the Great Gods thus provides a key point of access into the religious, political, and cultural forces that reshaped the visual terrain of the Hellenistic world.  Students will gain hands-on experience working with the archaeological material in our research portfolio and have the opportunity to work with an array of computer programs used to manage, model, reconstruct, and share this remarkable place on earth.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Student stories come from our project-based, civically engaged curriculum, which trains students to research the histories of local communities and to use digital media to share their discoveries in a wide variety of artistic and documentary mediums. Students in our classes are introduced to multiple research methods while simultaneously learning to become socially inquisitive and self-reflective citizens, critically and compassionately engaged with their communities and capable of pursuing these engagements with skill and purpose.  Our curriculum explores Newark's past and present through Newest Americans media and supplemental resources, while providing the tools for students to conduct their own community-based research projects and to represent their findings through digital media. By training the next generation of media makers, scholars, and citizens, we strive to engage younger and more diverse audiences in the stories that define our distinct histories and that will shape our common future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar probes the interplay of history, politics, and theatricality in Kong Shangren's Peach Blossom Fan, his dramatic masterpiece of 1699, which brilliantly depicts the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644-1645 on multiple social, cultural, and ritual fronts, from the pleasure quarters and the imperial court to the Confucian Temple and the battlefield.  Issues to be addressed include: the representation and reassessment of late Ming entertainment culture--courtesans, actors, storytellers, musicians, booksellers, painters; metatheatricality; memory and commemoration; props and material culture; the dissemination of news and (mis)information; the reenactment of the past on the stage, as we contextualize Peach Blossom Fan within the early Qing literary and theatrical world in which it was created and performed. We'll also examine the interplay of history, politics, and theatricality in the modern reception of the play by analyzing its modern and contemporary incarnations in spoken drama, feature film, and different operatic genres.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course examines key texts from antiquity through the 18th century related to music and sound. "Literature" is construed broadly to include the many genres in which music or sound play a principle part: philosophical and scientific essays; anecdotes, biographies, and tales; poems and informal essays; songbooks, formularies, and scores; encyclopedias and manuals. The course will be organized historically and thematically. Some of the issues we hope to investigate: the role of music in ritual and governance; theories of the voice and sound production; the translation of sound into words, and what is lost and gained; the pictorial representation of sound and listening; the relation between music and emotion; the social roles of musicians and entertainers; and the cultural significance of musical instruments.   No PRQ but some familiarity with Music or Chinese literature and history would be helpful.   All materials will be available in English but students with classical Chinese will be encouraged to read materials in the original when feasible.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Course: ENG 335: Community Writing: The Great Falls, 3 c Semester: Fall 2020 Each of us is a member of a variety of communities (neighborhood, workplace, house of worship, team, town, state, country, world, just to name a few). We navigate these communities daily: transitioning between them and often defining ourselves by them. Writing gives all of us an opportunity to extend audience outside of the traditional and sometimes constricting academic context.  Community Writing promotes citizenship. In general, the course is theme based depending on the instructor's preference. Themes might include economic inequality, race, gender, the local food revolution, climate change, human suffering, immigration, homelessness, prisons, etc. Over the course of the semester, students read the perspectives of a variety of thinkers (social scientists, biologists, educational theorists, journalists, citizens, etc.). Texts are posted in the Brightspace shell for the course. The class assumes a workshop format with in-class discussion and regular reading and writing assignments outside of the classroom. Students write papers and keep a weekly journal. For this particular class, students conduct interviews with individuals?from? Paterson.?They?complete a variety of?research and?writing?tasks that may include articles, interviews, profiles, histories, reports, fact sheets, reviews, and web-based writing of use to audiences outside of the University. Some of the writing for the course will be published and distributed to a much larger audience and to different kinds of readers than the student is accustomed to, allowing?them?to experience how their writing affects?the community.?   In addition to making a difference in the community, the course aims to make impressive additions to students' résumés and, in many cases, help them obtain internships and other work opportunities for the future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The grandeur of ancient objects is stunning.  But there is so much more to them than just their beauty.  Have you ever wondered how these astonishing things were created in the first place?  Just consider, for example…..  ?  Greek clay vessels: How on earth did ancient Greeks construct pottery kilns capable of reaching 950º Celsius (1740º Fahrenheit)?!  What did they burn for fuel?  How were clay vessels thrown, glazed, and fired?  ?  The quarrying and transport of marble and other stones in the ancient world: How were these massive blocks weighing many tons (!) extracted from the ground, hauled over land, rafted up and down rivers, loaded onto ships, shipped hundreds of miles across the Mediterranean, and transported to workshops and construction sites?  How were these logistics of transport socially and culturally embedded?  What role did slavery and the military play?  ?  Tools: Ancient sculptors used pickaxes and marble saws, chisels and drills, abrasives and waxes.  How did they even manage to carve marble — let alone granite (!) — without steel tools or modern power?  What were the fundamental differences between Greek, Roman, and Egyptian approaches to the carving process?  ?  And what about Greek bronze statues?  What about Roman mosaics, glass vessels, and wall paintings?  How were these made?  This course explores the materials, tools, techniques, and other physical components of Greco-Roman artistic practice, with an eye to the cultural values that Greeks and Romans attached to these physical components.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How can we explain the origins of Greek philosophy? If we look at how the early philosophers thought and wrote, we find evidence of technologies and technical analogies to describe the origins of the world, the formation of the heavens, the fundamental structure out of which the cosmos is built.  This evidence includes:  orienting pyramids and temples to cardinal directions, measuring the height of pyramids by their shadows, measuring the distance of a ship at sea, ancient surveying and engineering techniques that led to geometry, making a map of the Earth, a seasonal sundial, a model of the cosmos, the invention of coinage, and even the production of industrial textiles.  This course will uncover these ancient technologies and then apply them to the surviving evidence about the Greek philosophers to see what new insights we can discover about the how, when, where, what, and why of its beginnings. From this exploration, can students become more philosophical?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeologists have discovered marvelous inventions from the ancient world, long before engineering was considered to have been founded as a modern profession. How did ancient people measure time and location, travel, communicate, shelter, obtain food and water, or wage war? What propelled their inventiveness?  Some canonical discoveries have much to teach in terms of humanities and history as well as science and engineering. Using modern tools, feats of ancient engineering will be studied and modeled digitally or physically. Important engineering projects or inventions of the past covered such as sun dials, Stonehenge, the Antikythera mechanism, Roman roads, siege machines and aqueducts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What if I told you no one knew King Tut existed before his tomb was discovered and opened in 1922? Most people are aware of ancient Egypt in a very specific way, their knowledge guided by the fantastic and highly publicized discoveries of the last century of archaeological research:  Pyramids! Mummies! Previously unknown tombs! Heart disease in the mummy of a lesser princess! However, the texts written inside temples and tombs of Egypt during the time of the Pharaohs were highly restricted and written by and for specific audiences. Only the elites and royals would have been able to read them. Only royals and elites would have even had a large-scale rock cut tomb to provide texts. Only about 1% of ancient Egyptians were literate. What then of the other 99%, those that would have largely driven the Egyptian economy as the productive manufacturers and farmers?  This course focuses on understanding the broader scope of ancient Egypt beyond the monumental structures left behind by royals and elites to focus on the daily lives and lived experiences of the non-elite (those like you and me!) through analysis of archaeological remains of houses, non-elite burial grounds, and other records. The Pyramids, mummies, and statuary of ancient Egypt focus on what life was like among the highest elite. This course will use the archaeological site of Tell el-Amarna as the primary lens for discussions on the lives of the non-elites that would have comprised the bulk of the population. Amarna represents what remains of a single lens (15-20 year) occupation of an ancient capital city occupied by an estimated 50,000 individuals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ask any college student what they like to do in their spare time and most will mention either eating, drinking, or socializing. These activities, while enjoyable, actually have historical significance. Since the beginning of time, food and drink have been basic needs for every human being. However, the meaning behind these practices varied from culture to culture. For example, the ancient Greeks began their morning with barely bread dipped in wine. While this may be frowned upon in today's culture, this combination was thought to have healing powers. Also, the focus of a meal was to spend time socializing and please the palate, not to fill the stomach. In today's climate, the goal of eating changed to accommodate large portion sizes and busy schedules with less emphasis on the ancient philosophy of eating for wisdom, spirit, and nourishing the soul.   This course will take you back in time to explore ancient dietary customs and symbolism, including how materials for food and drink were gathered, processed and prepared, and their influence on health.  We will explore fermentation as a processing and preservation method and examine evidence of the impact of fermentation on the agricultural revolution and the dawn of civilization.  Specifically, this course will focus on:  Foods associated with different cultures in ancient times Symbolism behind common ancient foods Health status of ancient population compared to the health status of modern times How food and drink were gathered, processed and prepared Creating recipes from ancient food products Fermentation as a processing and preservation method and examine evidence of the impact of fermentation on the development of germ theory, human health, the agricultural revolution and arguably even the dawn of civilization.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>CWRGM lesson plans are designed by experienced educators who specialize in social studies, language arts, geography, and economics. Our goal is to help educators and students to dig deeply into our rich collections to  Better understand this revolutionary era Learn fundamental skills in historical analysis and interpretation. Our educators have designed these plans around a central idea: one of the best ways to understand the past and primary source documents, in particular, is to be able to explain them to others. In these activities, students will identify vocabulary they are unfamiliar with and define those terms. They will then analyze selected documents from the CWRGM collection using primary source analysis tools from the National Archives. Lastly, students will take that information and complete an assignment that evaluates their understanding of these sources and the history that surrounds them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>CDNP was selected to be a community partner for the Trinity College Public Humanities Collaborative (https://cher.trincoll.edu/community-learning/public-humanities-collaborative/), a summer research opportunity for undergraduate students to work on public humanities projects. Over the course of ten weeks (May 24-July 30, 2021), CDNP worked with three student interns to create two new guides to newspaper content, The Mental Hygiene Movement in Connecticut (https://ctdigitalnewspaperproject.org/the-mental-hygiene-movement-in-connecticut/) and the Mansfield State Training School. The guides help researchers find content on these topics in CT newspapers, and incorporate an interactive timeline made using TimelineJS.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This newly created first-year seminar is an interdisciplinary exploration of the Boston Harbor and its islands. "The Urban Ocean" will take full advantage of UMass-Boston's location on the waterfront to introduce first-year students to socio-environmental factors shaping Boston Harbor and the Boston Harbor Islands. Students will reflect on their evolving relationship with water through archival research, scientific experiments, and roundtable discussions with UMB's research groups, indigenous communities, and environmental organizations around Boston Harbor. The experience, knowledge, and community gained during this course will help students navigate the rest of their undergraduate education at UMass-Boston.      With the Atlantic Ocean on UMass-Boston's doorstep, this place-based course immerses students in the history, culture, and science of Boston Harbor and its Islands to understand the natural and anthropogenic factors shaping our waterfront. The impacts of anthropogenic development and climate change extend from the bustling city of Boston to the outer reaches of Boston Harbor Islands and the consequences of these impacts are shared across UMass-Boston's neighboring communities (e.g. Quincy, Dorchester, and South and East Boston) and abiotic and biotic communities. Throughout the course, students will reflect on their own relationships with water and their surroundings and the role they want to play as stewards</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Battle of Blair Mountain marks a significant turning point in West Virginia and United States history as the largest labor uprising to ever occur. However, the stories of Blair Mountain and other West Virginia mine wars have been predominantly forgotten and underrepresented in history, education, and media throughout time. In late August of 1921, the Battle of Blair Mountain lasted for five days where nearly, "10,000 miners fought against an army of 3,000 defenders entrenched along 14 mi. of steep ridges around Blair Mountain, only stopping when three regiments of federal troops were sent to the conflict zone. The miners were fighting against an unjust political and economic system in which coal operators held almost total control" (Nida, 2016). This battle influenced labor uprisings across the country, where workers were also not being treated fairly. Soon, labor unions were successfully formed, labor strikes occurred, and people began to question the social class systems and industrial companies controlling them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A course offered at Bay Area Video Coalition. The syllabus includes and utilizes resources and tools created by MIPoPS for the DVRescue project.   Course Description:With generous funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities BAVC Media is offering a Community-Based Preservation Education and Training program. Through this new program BAVC Media hopes to both address the urgency of preserving audiovisual content while digitization is still a material possibility, as well as broaden the diversity and inclusivity of the audiovisual preservation field. To accomplish this, we are working with community-based organizations to provide experiential training and education that is otherwise difficult or expensive to access graduate-level degree programs and on-the-job technical training.   The topics covered during this program will include: the setup and use of critical components of a tape-based audiovisual playback station, the maintenance and calibration of tape players and monitoring equipment, the repair and handling of tape-based media, and the identification or common video errors. These topics are meant to provide participants with hands-on experience working with audiovisual playback equipment, as well as experience performing tasks that are typically the responsibility of trained technicians. The goal is to provide individuals working with collections containing memory and heritage with the skills needed to properly preserve these materials amidst the coming magnetic media crisis.   Class instructions will all be provided remotely. These consist of asynchronous pre-recorded video resources as well synchronous office hours and group convenings, both facilitated via zoom. Office hours are scheduled for flexible chunks of time throughout the week. Group convenings will be minimal, but attendance is strongly suggested.  The program will consist of six modules taught over the course of six weeks. The instructions and assignments for each module will involve th</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The origins of medicine and philosophy are deeply connected. This is true not only in the Western traditions, but in many cultural and intellectual settings throughout the world. Moreover, not only is the historical development of philosophy and medicine inseparably interwoven, but they share a common motivation—and so also a common intellectual and emotional pattern. This motivation might best be expressed simply as "care for well-being." Medicine cares for the well-being of the body and philosophy cares for the well-being of thoughts, beliefs, and experience. Both traditions struggle to articulate what "well-being" means for human beings—body and mind—and both develop methods and procedures by which to remedy and avoid identifiable pathologies and errors. Furthermore, like the analogy that Plato's Socrates draws in Protagoras, whereby he imagines the similarities between those who care for the body—physicians—and those who care for the soul—philosophers (i.e., "physicians of the soul")—the one who participates in the cultivation of culture might be thought of as a "physician of culture." Both the body and the mind are experienced through the inherited cultural constellation of ideas, practices, and concerns that have shaped our lives from birth. To examine, compare, appreciate, and critique these inherited cultural ideas participates too in that same care for well-being. Despite having been "thrown," as it were, into an always already on-going constellation of cultural traditions, each of us is also always in the position to evaluate these, select some, discard others, and create still more. This process of evaluation and creativity with regards to the question of what sort of life is most worth of our love and striving might be summed up as: the question and quest for the good life. Therefore, our aim in this course is to draw on both philosophy and medicine to enable us to understand the everyday practical and existential question about the choiceworth life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What does it mean and what does it take to "care" for others? This course asks these basic questions through explorations of Japan. Throughout its history Japan has fought to survive natural disasters, famines and disease in addition to the fighting between Samurais to unite the country's leadership. The customary practices—extending from daily habits (such as taking a bath or drinking tea) to superstitious rituals—often came from the fear of sickness, hope for a cure, and prayer. We will study the history of Japan and examine various artifacts (literature, arts, designed objects and spaces, etc.), which reflect these customary practices and beliefs from different time periods.  Modern Japan also faces serious social issues including suicide, overwork, unbalanced demographics due to low birth rates, and negative environmental effects associated with industrialization, natural disasters, and war. While these current issues are not unknown to other countries, there are some public health systems and services unique to Japan such as a Mother-Child Pocketbook. Thus, we will analyze the "caring" system in Japan from various perspectives including medical, health, nursing, and childcare.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is a city, and how does emotion influence its development and health? This course is premised on the notion that cities are people(d).  We ?are cities. We make policies.  We draw boundaries.  We decide who is in and who is out, who is dangerous and who is safe. We design buildings.  We invest money or divest, and we have the capacity to perpetuate harm or cultivate compassion within cityscapes.    While cities often are characterized as bustling epicenters of trade, consumption, development, and creation, they also are spaces rife with conflict and complexity.  This course examines social problems within cities, proposing that we can challenge and erode oppressive structures within them, and thereby contribute to the health of a city.   Through examination of social issues such as immigration and indigeneity, homelessness and place, imagined communities and so-called dangerous classes, we will identify patterns of (in)compassion and envision new paradigms and structures that give everyone a right to health in the city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Can the subaltern speak?" --Gayatri Chakravorti Spivak Beasts and Burdens will investigate health (inequality) and risk through the artistic lens of women and children in southern, postcolonial spaces, examining their critical, creative, and unconventional responses to subjugation. Through thematic and geographic "travels," students will examine axes of inequality, subalternity, and survival among women and children across the globe. This course will leverage audio, video, imagery, and narrative as windows into the social imaginary. Several questions animate this course including the following: What are ways in which women's voices emerge in the humanistic social sciences, and how do their voices circulate? How can students and scholars of the (global) south envision alternative narratives and intervene upon existing characterizations? That is, what are elsewheres and elsewhens of representing power and agency in southern spaces? Finally, what are ways in which we can critically theorize gender inequality, health, and resilience in risky spaces? How can we map them and map onto them? As such, the study of (gendered) violence, power, and socioeconomic and environmental conflict are central to the issues that this course seeks to examine.  While this course privileges the stories and lived experiences of women and children of the (global) south because they often are silent and/or silenced in academic spaces, it welcomes students of all gender identities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this collaboration between the USF Honors College and the Ringling Museum of Art, Honors students learn about medical conditions such as dementia, depression, substance use disorder, and PTSD and are trained to facilitate interactions with works of art for patient groups dealing with these diagnoses. Students will learn how to deliver therapeutic interactions with art that allow participants to give their own personal interpretations without fear of judgment or failure. The methods utilized in class have been found to help patients access and express memories, improve communication skills, externalize emotions, relieve stress and anxiety, and promote positive feelings. This class will also instruct students in the practices of observation, deep listening, and critical thinking, build empathy and understanding, and engage students with the community. This capstone course will allow students to participate in furthering the research in these areas by providing an immersive experience at the intersection of art, medicine, and mental health.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Summarizing Dante's popularity in Italy in the early twentieth century, one critic amusingly observed that the medieval poet "was cooked in every sauce, served hot and cold, grilled and in gelatin, whole and ground, alone or with sides, with critical mayonnaise and historical croutons: there was something for all tastes, for strong stomachs and for dyspeptic ones, for women and for men, for kindergartners and for doddering academics." In this course we will seek intellectual nourishment at the banquet of Dante's legacy by closely examining a broad range of responses to the poet—the man and his works—from Giovanni Boccaccio's biography in the late Middle Ages to Roberto Benigni's performances of TuttoDante and Dan Brown's Inferno. Between the Dante-inspired works of Boccaccio and Brown, we will study various, often conflicting, versions of "Dante" in literature, art, film, politics, history, and popular culture. After establishing a foundation for Dante's influence by discussing his political treatise (Monarchia) and selected cantos of his Commedia (most from Inferno), we will embark on an interpretive journey tracing Dante's evolution from a regional to a national (then nationalist) figure before he attained the global status he enjoys today. Giuseppe Mazzini famously called Dante—Ugo Foscolo's "Ghibelline fugitive"—the "Prophet of the Italian Nation": we will accordingly examine appeals to Dante's authority in promoting the liberation and unification of Italy, but we will also consider his role as a beacon of liberty in the United States. Among other areas of inquiry, we will discuss Catholic interpretations of Dante as a neo-Guelph advocate of papal political power, nationalist appropriations of the poet for territorial expansion and military interventions, and recent representations of Dante as an icon of Italian culture on the world stage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ITC 330: American Dante  "The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality."   Although Dante never said these exact words, they effectively convey his contempt for people who refuse to take a stand on questions of moral, political, and social justice. Engaged readers have had good reason to quote the "Dante" line at pivotal moments in US history, from decisions about entering the two world wars to John F. Kennedy's call to combat bigotry and Martin Luther King Jr's plea to end the war in Vietnam. Black Lives Matter activists and the California governor therefore drew on an illustrious tradition when they cited the medieval Italian poet in the summer of 2020 to inspire action against systemic racism.   Political engagement with Dante in the United States actually dates to the mid 19th century—in the movement to abolish slavery and during the ensuing Civil War—and is just one of several major themes we will explore in this course on the Italian poet's strong presence in American history and culture. Other Dantean personas examined across a wide range of media—literature, art, music, film, television, and video games—will include the lover, the showman, and the judge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Foundations &amp;amp; Applications of Humanities Analytics course is aimed at a broad range of humanities scholars. The course aims to empower scholars in the humanities by eliminating the "black box" of computational text analysis. Participants will gain a theoretical and practical understanding of text analysis methods, and will learn how to extract content and derive meaning from digital sources, enabling new humanities scholarship. The online course will interweave lectures and assignments that impart a foundational and philosophical understanding of humanities analytics techniques with those that apply this foundational understanding to real-world data sets arising in literary, cultural, and political contexts. Supplementary resources will introduce the necessary steps to get started with Python programming and Jupyter notebooks, though programming skills will not be taught – or required – during the course.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>These curriculum guides were designed by and for secondary and post-secondary instructors. Please use them to augment existing curriculum in your classroom, as guides for further independent study, or simply for fostering community conversations.  Notes about these guides: First, they are just that—guides. They are meant to offer suggestions for how you might approach these important yet sensitive topics in your classroom, as well as ideas for how you might augment existing curriculum in your classroom. Please adapt them as necessary to fit your classroom's needs.  Second, while they are aimed at 10th grade students, many of the activities can easily be adapted both for lower and higher grades, and we encourage you to do so.  Third, since the International Storytelling Center is based in Tennessee, we have used the Tennessee state academic standards for Social Studies as our guide, but have also included Common Core standards where appropriate in an attempt to provide some reciprocity between, and among, state curriculums. Please feel free to use your own state standards in place of Tennessee or Common Core standards.  Fourth, our collective understanding of the subject matter covered in these Freedom Stories Curriculum Guides is ever-evolving as we unearth forgotten narratives and seek out more complete truths. As such, there may be instances where certain instructional approaches are no longer useful, or where certain resources are no longer applicable. We encourage you to keep this in mind as you use these guides and adapt activities with new information as it becomes available.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course builds on the current fascination with wealth and status to help students gain wisdom for living in capitalism. Complementing the special exhibit called "Money Worries" at the Snite Museum of Art, the course questions the "rational" nature of markets and the concept of value. We will study literature (fairy tales, fables, poetry and novels by Honoré de Balzac, Ayn Rand, and Alain Mabanckou) alongside theories of human behavior by economists Robert J. Shiller and Ha-Joon Chang in order to understand how value is assigned to certain products and social profiles (and not others), and to see how the marketing of elitism depends on socio-political factors to succeed. We will end with a consideration of some alternative economies that provide hope for the future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Donald Trump (United States), Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), Boris Johnson (Britain), Viktor Orbán (Hungary), Narendra Modi (India) – it is clear that right-wing populists have come to power in country after country.  Few have grasped, however, that Latin America was the first place where the modern version of this phenomenon appeared.  This course will trace and explore a variety of rightist movements -- ranging from conservative to right-wing populist to fascist -- around the world.  We will compare these groups and analyze the connections among them across ideological, temporal, and national borders.  No less important is the opposition they have sparked.  How have people contested and fought against rightist movements? We will examine these contending forces using the perspectives of gender, race, class, and culture.  The readings will cover Latin America, Europe, the United States, Africa, and Asia, as well as theoretical issues related to gender, revolution, and counterrevolution.  History students can take this course either for World (5306) or Latin American (5309) credit.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The introductory unit, Volume 1, introduces the work of photojournalist Richard Cross, the conflicts in Central America, and the history and culture of the Afro-Colombian community of Palenque de San Basilio. It asks the overarching question of why do these photographs and this history matter today? Volume 2 explores with the students how the environment affected agriculture, population, and cities in Mesoamérica before and after the encounter with Spanish and other European explorers that led to the colonization of Central America. Volume 3 focuses on the history of the Guatemala conflict that started in the 1950s and extended into the 1990s. It covers also de Mayan genocide and the forced migration of Mayans to Mexico. Volume 4 centers on El Salvador's civil war from 1979 to 1992, where more than 80,000 people died, and a third of the population was displaced, many of them in a large exodus to the United States. Volume 5 centers on Nicaragua and the Sandinista revolution. And the additional Volume 6 focuses on the history and culture of Palenque de San Basilio as documented by Richard Cross as part of a visual anthropology project in the 1970s. The community's historical importance for Afro-Colombians and Afro-Latin Americans has grown over time thanks to a great extent by the work of Richard Cross.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Religious Studies minor is for students who are curious about the religions of the world, the impact of religious belief on the world at large, and the nature of belief. As an interdisciplinary minor, students can take courses in Philosophy, History, Ethnic Studies, Sociology, and other programs. This minor provides a deeper understanding of other cultures, helps students read and write about complex ideas, develop logical thinking skills, and become people capable of thinking through ethical dilemmas. These are traits that employers need and want. This minor can provide depth to any major program. The courses that students can take in this minor will help them understand the diversity of ideas and human experience that we all need to understand and respond to no matter our professions. For example, many nursing and health care programs require at least one course in Religious Studies to help their graduates better understand the religious beliefs that people hold that impact the health care that they seek or refuse.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our current Managing Editor, Andrew S. Kohler, has taught the bibliography course (Musicology 503) at the University of Michigan since 2018. Working with our previous Managing Editor, Jessica L. Getman (who is still part of the Editorial Board), he has incorporated a lesson plan on critical editions into his curriculum. This year, he taught a revised version of this lesson plan, including extensive examples from the AN AMERICAN IN PARIS and PORGY AND BESS editions, as well as the editorial apparatus used by the Gershwin Critical Edition. Dr. Kohler has found that this unit is among the most well-received by his students, most of whom are DMA performance majors who often have to think about the scores that they use. In the past, he has had students join the Gershwin Team or embark on their own editorial work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course will survey Rochester area social reformers who led a number of critical reform movements, identifying problems with the status quo and proposing solutions to those problems. They worked to establish a new social order and even to perfect society. As an Erie Canal boom town and major manufacturing hub, Rochester inspired generations of famous reformers who made principled arguments for improving urban life and labor relations, ending slavery and securing civil rights for African Americans, and claiming equality for American women. Students will study the historical impact of celebrated social reformers such as Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony as well as less well known figures like religious revivalist Charles Finney, urban park reformer Charles Mulford Robinson, and advocate of the social gospel Walter Rauschenbusch. The course will also introduce contemporary efforts that have attempted to reshape principles of social justice locally and nationally. In the 20th century the social reform movement efforts turned to the ethical and social problems of a modernizing America, debating solutions to the pressing problems of urbanization, immigration, and environmental protection. Students will also work on a community-based research project focusing on the history and impact of particular Rochester reformers. Lecture 3 (Spring).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The course uses both literature and geography, artful writing and creative mapping, to explore the art of storytelling in both fictional and real places. From Sherlock Holmes's 221B Baker St. London to J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, geography is more than an artistic theme, and maps are more than creative illustrations. We will read literature that uses spatial dimensions not only to indicate a destination and point of origin, but to create place–spectacular stories from the Iowa plains to rust belt cities to the networked future. We will also navigate a specific geographical space, telling numerous narrative stories about its pavement and is inhabitants. Through community-based research, students will explore a Rochester community, story-mapping its complex histories, social networks, and contemporary environments. Using literary geography, students will integrate their writing into a final mosaic project–a collaborative digital community map. Lecture 3 (Spring).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course examines Rochester through the lens of industrialization, immigration, technological innovation, and environmental change between the 1890s and 1990s. This class blends readings and discussion with experiential learning and community-based research projects to help students understand community identity as a result of changes in livelihoods, immigration, and environment. Students will examine these social changes in both a local and global context. Students will have a better appreciation for the way historical forces shape a contemporary sense of place.

		<Abstract>•April 5-9: Faculty travel to New York City: African American cultural history of New York itself as well as the city's diverse collections of black cultural expression in general. Works of Harlem Renaissance artists are on display at Metropolitan Museum of Art, and faculty explored the DC Moore Gallery's exhibition "Romare Bearden: Bayou Fever and Related Works." The Whitney holds a broad collection of contemporary works, noteworthy in generating dialog about race, sex, and their intersectionality. Faculty also had the opportunity to analyze and appreciate a performance by the Stanley Clarke Band at the Blue Note Jazz Club. A daylong excursion in Harlem yielded significant insight from collections at the Schomburg Center, the Harlem Studio Museum, the National Jazz Museum, the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Center, and the Folk Art Museum. The final day of research focused on the collections of Kehinde Wiley and Kara Walker at the Brooklyn Museum. Faculty also explored the Weeksville Heritage Center to learn more about this early free black community. They completed lesson plans on this new curriculum material from their trip and presented the lesson plans to the SSC Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning on their return.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>•June 4-10 Faculty travelled to San Francisco  to study Asian American culture and history. They toured the Asian Art Museum, Chinatown tour (including the Tin How Temple), Japantown, the Japanese Tea Gardens, and Ruth Asawa's examples of public art throughout the city. The Catherine Clark Gallery arranged a private tour of their holdings of Masami Teraoka works, and faculty encountered other Asian American artists on display at the SFMOMA. Critical trips to the immigrant detention center at Angel Island (the "Ellis Island of the West") with its moving poetry on the dormitory walls and road trip out to the former Japanese internment camp at Manzanar transformed understandings of Asian American history. They completed lesson plans on this new curriculum material from their trip and presented the lesson plans to the SSC Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning on their return.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>•February 15-17:  Faculty Development trip to Miami. The Faculty Advisory Committee also organized three curriculum development projects. The first was a screening of the documentary Check It for the Humanities department faculty. This screening was followed by a group discussion on the lack of diversity in media representations of the LGBTQ community and opportunities to incorporate more diversity into this aspect of the curriculum. For the second program, six faculty members travelled to Miami, Florida. On the first day of the trip, faculty visited the Stonewall National Museum and Archives for an exhibit on LGBT history in the US and "Sisters of the Commonwealth" by Meg Birnbaum, which focused on a group of queer and trans nuns called the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The group also went to the Florida International University Frost Art Gallery for an exhibition entitled "To Survive on this Shore." The exhibit featured photographs of individuals before and after transition with biographical excerpts from interviews the photographer did with each subject. The exhibit was a powerful demonstration of the diversity of the trans community. On the second day of the trip, faculty visited the Miami Beach Historic Preservation League for a guided walking tour on the LGBT history of Miami Beach. In addition, they visited the Perez Art Museum which featured artwork by some LGBT artists (Robert Rauschenberg, Marcel Duchamp) and other artists who question gender identity (Ebony Patterson). One of the key discussions during this trip was the question of how important an artist's gender identity may or may not be to teaching students to interpret their work.  They completed lesson plans on this new curriculum material from their trip and presented the lesson plans to the SSC Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning on their return.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Faculty Development Trip to New York City: Finally, six faculty also travelled to New York City for curriculum development research. For this trip, faculty visited number of art museums: the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney, and the Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian art. For the visit to the Met, the faculty also took a guided tour called Gay Secrets of the Met led by Dr. Andrew Lear. They also visited the New York Public Library for the exhibit "Love &amp;amp; Resistance: Stonewall 50". Finally, they participated in a historical walking tour of Greenwich Village including the Stonewall Inn, also led by Dr. Lear. Faculty submitted proposals and written assessments of their research for both trips and will host workshops demonstrating their research for the college in the fall of 2019.

		<Abstract>This remote, online workshop will feature an integrated program of place-based and participatory learning activities related to the events and personalities of the American Revolution at seven partnering historic sites in Vermont's Champlain Valley. Participants will "virtually" follow a route, on land and water, from a yeoman Vermonter's 18th century homestead to war, and back again. Along the way, they will encounter the landscapes, artifacts, sites, and primary sources that allow students to engage with the multiple stories and competing worldviews of frontier Vermont—and to relate them to the persisting tensions between rural and urban communities across contemporary America. Using the backdrop of the area's Revolutionary War Sites, teachers from a range of disciplines and grade levels (although focused primarily on grades 6-12) will delve deeply into place-based education. This workshop will use interactive, web-based technology to enable participants to immerse themselves in the sites and material culture of Revolutionary Vermont. From the life-sized replica of Benedict Arnold's USS Philadelphia gunboat to the nation's best-preserved Revolutionary War archaeological site at Mount Independence, teachers will learn firsthand the potential of place-based education at historic sites: to provide personally resonant experiences that serve as a foundation for understanding contemporary issues of regional, national, or global importance. Additionally, participants will discover practical assignments and lesson plans for use in their own classrooms. During the week, participants will use the Vermont historic sites and characters as a lens, looking back at their own schools and home areas to find the undiscovered gems in their own local histories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 30 participants in the 2021 "We the People": Migrant Waves in the Making of America NEH Summer Institute were tasked with creating a digital, multimodal text set as a study of a state, region, time period, or people's history. These multimodal text sets are critical studies of those histories around past and current waves of migration and center perspectives of traditionally underrepresented communities. This webpage houses the 22 digital collections, as some participants created their text sets in collaboration with other participants. Each text set includes a synopsis and an annotated bibliography. These were created as part of each participant's research and are published as curricular materials accessible to the general public for use/inspiration in their respective educational settings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Northeastern's Digital Health Humanities Teaching Modules are open-access resources that introduce students to the cultural and ethical challenges posed by the data-heavy medicine of the future to privacy, the appropriate collection of medical data, and the ways that patients and healthcare workers alike think about health. These modules teach students how to parse the ethics of digital technologies and big-data approaches to healthcare, how to analyze narratives that structure contemporary healthcare, and how to use historical and contemporary data about health disparities to forecast social and cultural challenges posed by new technologies. In short, they use the humanities and social sciences to evaluate social and cultural aspects of a healthcare system shaped by emerging technologies and the data they produce.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One tool we used throughout the project was Flipgrid, an online application that allowed participants to create short video "essays" that could in turn be shared with the instructors and with the whole group for critique. We used these videos in a few different capacities over the course of the week, first as a different way to collect short answer prompts to assess comprehension ("How a Local Building Reflects the Values of the Community," "Reading a Chicago Building," A Meaningful Tall Building to You") and as a final report where participants explored a building in their own community, examining its history, context, materials, function, accessibility, and other subjects discussed during the course (Week 1 Final Videos, Week 2 Final Videos).  Please use the guest password "skyscrapers2021" to access the videos.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Guide Training was offered to 30 guides who volunteered to provide guided tours of the exhibit and to staff the arrival point and gift shop.  The course was provided in 10 sessions, on either Tuesday mornings or evenings, to accommodate as many guides as possible.  The sessions were held on zoom.  Some were recorded; some were not due to technical issues.  There were several guest speakers: Otis Edwards, a Ph.D. candidate in history at the University of Hong Kong, spoke Captain Robert Bennet Forbes and his development of a supply ship at LinTin off the China coast that supplied sundries to sailors but also served as a new smuggling point for opium; Elisabeth Nevins, a museum educator and evaluator; who provided information about how to engage visitors and provide interesting tours; Angela Lee, a HS world history teacher, specializing in the China Trade; Tom Claflin, a businessman operating trade operations in China now; Bill Sargent, the former H.A. Crosby Forbes Curator of Asian Export Art, who spoke on various art objects in the collection that will be included in the exhibition; Kristin Wason, RN, NP, Addictions Specialist, who spoke on the opioid epidemic; Karen Groce-Horan and Jayne Otago, of Courageous Conversations for Racial Justice, who directed a guided conversation about Asian racism, beginning with the China Trade and continuing today; Jill Conley, project curator who discussed handling objects and care of the collections, Barbara Silberman, Project Director, who provided background on the Forbes family, and the ships that were used in the Trade, as well as safety and security for visitors; and Heidi Vaughan, Executive Director, who provided background on the Museum and provided additional information for many sessions.  Fifteen of the original participants completed the program and will provide guide services for the exhibition.  One other person audited the course, and two others are in HS and will complete the course at the end of the school year.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course interrogates "health" and its relation to both cultures and societies from multiple perspectives across the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities. We begin by asking what do we mean by health—is health something fixed across time and cultures or is it variable? Is health a property of an individual or something better thought of in terms of a community? Health is something we desire and understood as a "good," but also sometimes imposed upon us as a moral imperative. Health may stand in for other socially desirable qualities: beauty, youth, racialized and gendered ideals. How do we measure and track health or wellness—for ourselves, for others, for our communities? How has health, well-being, illness, disease been understood and experienced in different places and different times? Topics to be explored include cross-historical and cross-cultural concepts of contagion, disease, illness, medicine, care, and healing; public health and health disparities; uses and misuses of data; health history and why history matters for thinking about and seeking health. This course is co-taught by multiple faculty and local experts and open to all students, though particularly addressed to students in their first 4 contracts. The class will work together on a wide range of content and regularly break into smaller ‘focus groups.' There will be at least one off-campus assignment. Additional lectures and events related to class topics and careers will be offered and attendance at a set number may be expected. This course fulfills the "Introduction" requirement for the HCS joint-AOC or secondary field. Full Term Course. Associated Term: Spring 2022 Registration Dates: Sep 06, 2021 to Jun 15, 2022 Levels: Undergraduate Attributes: CYC - All, CYC Integrative Learning, CYC Critical Thinking, CYC Teamwork, First-Year Appropriate Course, Gender Studies Eligible, Health, Culture, and Societies, Humanities, Interdisciplinary Studies, Primarily Classroom Course</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This intensive ISP is directed to students interested in learning more about health-related career options and professions—from the familiar (doctor, nurse, therapist, doula or midwife) to the less familiar (health information and health communication specialist, healthcare technology specialist, healthcare lawyer, medical illustrator, medical librarian, global health fieldwork and program director, editor for health or medical professional publications). This ISP fulfills the "Professionalization Seminar" requirement for the HCS-Joint AOC.   This ISP will include meeting with a range of health and health-adjacent professionals (including NCF alums!) to learn about their work, their preparation and education. We'll be exploring together here!  Participants will be expected to attend regular meetings (some in person, some on zoom) with professionals and alumni/ae who will share their career experiences. Plan on meeting 3X in the first two or three weeks for up to 1.5 hours each, and then working independently to prepare your final project.   Some off-campus experiences may be included, schedules permitting. Some readings and website reviews will be required. A regular reflection journal is expected.  •Final project: choose a particular health-related career path, research it, and present to the group in the final week. We'll share information about how to discover interesting career options, where to research them (including informational interviews), and a format for presentations.     Projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) show that healthcare jobs are expected to increase by 18% from 2016 through 2026.  Open to students at all levels.  Expect to spend time preparing for our meetings with visitors, and developing your Health Careers profile. Meeting 3 days weekly is likely.   Course will be offered in person, with some online portions (visits with experts).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar explores histories of health, gender, and sexuality, by focusing on the intertwining of two institutions that have fundamentally shaped our culture: medicine and marriage. It uses marriage as a lens for viewing the historical and social transformations of the American medical profession, as well as to examine the medicalization of intimate relationships in the broader society. Weekly readings cover topics such as: eugenics, LGBTQ marriage and adoption, disability rights, sexuality and reproduction, sex education, health activism, the changing gender composition of the health professions, and the reform of medical education and training. Students also analyze a variety of primary sources, ranging from scientific studies and medical advice literature to popular magazines and romantic comedy films.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This interdisciplinary honors seminar focuses on what we call "Miami Studies," a field of inquiry and urban studies that centers Miami and its many surrounding communities, cultures, and histories. Miami is one of the most important cities in the United States and the Americas. Yet its history, culture, politics, and overall meaning are still largely caricatured through myth, stigma, and hyperbole, all of which are deeply rooted in the region's layered past and relationship to colonial processes and empire. Although the region and the millions of people who reside in and traverse it every year remain woefully understudied and misunderstood, community and grassroots efforts have long created, fostered, and studied local knowledges that serve as a corrective to this broader national narrative that has marginalized and underscored Miami as a site of significant cultural and intellectual inquiry and impact.   This course will ask you to dig deeper into Miami's past by not only unpacking its difficult and untold histories, but also by inviting you to learn through immersive experiences, particularly through visits to museums, historic sites, archives, and cultural institutions. Visits tentatively include the Historic Hampton House, the Black Archives, HistoryMiami Museum, and the Museum of Graffiti. We will also benefit from lectures and workshops with practitioners and curators.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Course Description Italian business is an advanced seminar in Italian language and general business culture for 400 level students. It will be structured in weekly modules in which students explore both cultural and practical aspects of the Italian economy within the European Union. For example, they will investigate how traditions and customs affect the country economy as well as they will learn commercial terminology and business practices. Moreover, the seminar will include an Italian film dealing with the world of business. These films aim at familiarize students not only with business situations but also with pivotal moments in Italian economic history such as the economic boom, the Mattei case, and the Parmalat scandal. The seminar will provide an introduction to Italian economy from the 1950 to the present, focusing on key factors in the transition from an agricultural based economy to a leading country in word trade and exports (‘Made in Italy' brand, vehicles, clothing, furniture, food, wine etc.). The seminar will also aim at the acquisition and reinforcement of the essential, practical content, vocabulary and style to every-day business situations and transactions. Each module will offer a specific business situation in which students in pairs or small groups introduce themselves in a business meeting, make travel arrangements, write their resume and cover letter, prepare for a job interview, create a business plan and launch a new product. Finally, while students will be familiarizing themselves with the language and the practices of Italian business, they will also review advanced grammatical structures in writing and speaking.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Hellenistic period was a dynamic era in the history of the Greek polis, as kings and local communities throughout the central and eastern Mediterranean world engaged in complicated and shifting maneuvers in pursuit of their sometimes conflicting, sometimes mutual interests. This seminar will examine archaeological evidence for the development of the Hellenistic city with a special focus on western Anatolia, which includes our best-preserved Hellenistic royal capital, Pergamon, a number of centuries-old Greek communities on the western coast, such as Miletus and Ephesus, and one of the most dynamic regions of new city-founding in the Hellenistic period, in the Maeander River basin. The seminar develops out of the UM-sponsored archaeological project at Notion, and it will be structured in the same way as the in-progress publication of the results of the Notion Archaeological Survey; after a few introductory sessions, each meeting will begin with a brief look at a specific subject or category of evidence at Notion, and then proceed to a broader comparative examination of that subject or category of evidence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course is an interdisciplinary study of mass incarceration in the modern world. Using interpretive analyses of history, literature, philosophy, and other humanistic disciplines, students will examine, explore, and debate the role of the modern nation-state in establishing and maintaining carceral systems. This will include the historical role of state-sponsored police and the experiences of people imprisoned. Students develop an understanding of mass incarceration and state-sponsored policing through case studies from the United States and comparative global contexts. They will engage with a variety of media, including content created by and about incarcerated people. In so doing, students will consider the community impact of these carceral systems. The course uses a variety of student-centered activities, close readings of texts, in-class debates, and reflection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course is an examination of the role of work in society and the ethical implications of its organizational patterns. Students will engage with a variety of texts that serve to historically ground the rise of the division of labor, its disparate effects on individuals and communities, and the ethical dilemmas raised in changing patterns of domestic and global economic activity. In doing so, students will develop their own views on work's relationship to civic life and democracy, evaluating and deliberating on ideas and proposals discussed in class. They will do this while reflecting on work experiences they or community members have had, and they will relate these and other ethnographic narratives discussed to their own professional goals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This introductory "gender studies" course will center the voices of black and brown people, low- and no-income people, and queer and trans people, as we ask: how have ideas about "femininity" and "masculinity" impacted different individuals and groups? How are these ideas enforced, and how have they changed over time? What social and cultural influences affect our understanding and embodiment of gender, specifically with respect to race, sexuality, and socio-economic status? And what even is gender; what does it mean to say, as many do today, that gender is performative? By analyzing gender, how might we come to understand it in the context of social justice rather than as biological fact? Might we embrace theory and literary interpretation as the praxis of enacting gender in ways that restore justice and repair harm for so many (perhaps, for all) who have suffered under gender's ideological-political regime?   This course will incorporate some canonical gender theory texts while simultaneously including literature that handles matters of gender as matters of life and love, enabling us to approach the theoretical questions as more embodied and thus relevant. By examining some of the theories contributing to the gender debates in the west, students will gain a new frame through which to interpret a variety of literature and develop a deeper understanding of gender identity, especially attending to how it is influenced by distinctions of race, class, desire, and ethnicity.

		<Abstract>Law is everywhere. Law permits, prohibits, enables, legitimates, protects, and prosecutes citizens. Law shapes our day to day lives in countless ways. This course examines the connections and relationships of law and society using an interdisciplinary social science approach. As one of the founders of the Law and Society movement observed, "Law is too important to leave to lawyers." Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical, disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (such as sociology, anthropology, political science, critical studies, psychology) to explore the sociology of law and law's role primarily in the American context (but with some attention to international law and global human rights efforts). The thematic topics to be discussed include law and social control; law's role in social change; as well as law's capacity to reach into complex social relations and intervene in existing normative institutions, organizational structures, and the like. Goals and Learning Objectives   Upon completion of the course, students will have developed the following: 1. the ability to examine social structures analytically and critically; 2. knowledge of how people change society by forming social movements and using the media; 3. a comparative perspective on cultures, social structures, institutions, and practices; and 4. the ability to read and understand original research published by sociologists.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course is a hybrid computer-technology and studio arts course where students will create their own book using a combination of writing and visual design and image. In Graphic Arts, students will learn the basics of publication design and will become fluent in a widely used digital design program, Adobe InDesign or an equivalent. Students will learn the history of Western typography and learn about type classifications. Students will also design and collaboratively print a visual text-based zine using InDesign while studying the works of early modernists such as FT Marinetti, along with mid- century concrete poetry, David Carson's 90s deconstructed page experiments and Marian Bantjes' 21st century calligraphic work. Students will also study contemporary artist's books, photobooks, zines and graphic novels. Over the course of the semester, students will acquire basic graphic design skills as they also learn how to design and illustrate, pre-press and print their own 32-page book. We will use the work of Sophie Calle, Jim Goldberg, Charmaine Wheatley, Glen Ligon, and Chris Ware to study various text/image relationships and explore sequencing to form meaning. No prior art or computer experience is required. Learning Objectives - to develop graphic design skills in page layout design and book design - to learn about and creatively use typography - to develop an expressive visual language in combining text and imagery in order to produce an artist's book - to learn about contemporary artists - to develop critical skills in understanding graphic arts and specifically artist's books as an art medium</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This survey provides an introduction to the great British poetry, fiction, and social commentary from the era of social and political revolution of the late 18th Century to the transformations of Modernism ushered in by the World Wars in the first half of the 20th Century. We will take a rather sweeping "general view" of the literature written during these one hundred and fifty plus years by paying particular attention to aesthetic experiment and innovation within the context of persistent themes and broad cultural trends. Considering some of the highlights of the English tradition, including those which challenge or revise the very notions of Englishness and tradition, we will trace evolving ideas about the function of the artist in society, practice reading poetry out loud to learn about meter and prosody, and look at some of the ways the literature of this period can help us to think about the ways we use language today.   More specifically, through an investigation of the shifting relationship between the British Literature of the past 150+ years and the sociopolitical contexts in which it was produced, we will learn how to develop historically informed methods of approaching literary texts.  At the same time, we will be attentive to the various ways writers of this period use language as an art form in order to think about how different writing styles change how an idea is understood.  Finally, by writing close analytical commentaries on the texts we read, we will cultivate an understanding of our own relationship to and use of the English language.  In sum, as we explore the flexibility of English to represent and reflect on a wide range of cultural and historical conditions, we will be constantly considering the role that the creative uses of language can play in navigating the complexities of the  world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We all tell stories.  We all listen to stories we hear from friends, read or see on television.  Why are these stories (particularly fictional ones) so important, even necessary, an element in what it means to be human?  That question is at the center of this course.  And if those stories are everywhere and in every culture, does that mean the stories are the same and work in the same way?  Do they perform different functions in those different cultures and at different times in history?  In this course we will attempt to understand those questions by reading, discussing, and writing about a selection of short fiction, beginning in the 19th century and moving to the present day. We will explore how the tradition of short fiction differs from that of the novel but also from non-fiction writing.  Finally, the readings will be from a diverse set of authors, and we will ask if and how the genre takes on different shapes and purposes in their hands.    Texts:  All readings will be from The Norton Anthology of Short Fiction, 8th edition, Richard Bausch and R.V. Cassill, editors, with the exception of those provided in a small xerox packet (x).  Student Learning Outcomes 1.Generate inclusive dialogue by a) listening to and expressing points of view on arguable topics in an atmosphere of mutual respect and civility and b) considering audience, situation and intercultural context  2.Demonstrate ability to create knowledge and expression of self through diverse generic forms including expository, journalistic, personal narrative, and creative writing  3.Integrate knowledge from academic fields with personal experiences in order to inform one's own role in creating a more just society that advances equity and values community cultural wealth  4.Examine own and others' assumptions, biases, and experiences including acknowledging contradictions within diverse and intersectional identities and perspectives  5.Apply an equity lens to engage in empowering educational explorati</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is race?  How is race different than ethnicity?  How does race impact the experiences of individuals and groups?  What can be done about racial inequality?  In this course, we will explore these questions though a sociological lens. We begin by examining the processes that create racial and ethnic difference – histories of racial formation through settler colonialism and empire; practices of prejudice, discrimination, and racial domination; and dynamics that contribute to the ongoing social construction of racial and ethnic boundaries and meanings. Students will look to how social movements have challenged the status quo in pursuit of racial justice. Though this course focuses on race and ethnicity in the United States, we will periodically examine how race operates in other national contexts and as a global phenomenon. By the end of the semester, we will have a better understanding of how race powerfully shapes lived experiences – including our own – and how race comes to have this power in the first place.  COURSE GOALS  This course emphasizes understanding and applying theory, reading empirical scholarship, and analytical writing. We will also frequently apply course concepts to discussion of current events. These activities aim to develop your ability to critically evaluate existing sociological research, hone your skills as independent and creative researchers, and apply your learning to contexts outside of the classroom.  Specifically, my aim in this course is to develop the tools you have to: •Understand the historical and political processes that construct racial and ethnic categories •Use comparative frameworks to interrogate how race and ethnicity vary across time and space •Analyze how race operates at the individual, institutional, and structural levels; and how race intersects with other social statuses like gender and class •Describe a range of contemporary racial inequalities and apply concepts like prejudice, discrimination, and racism in an</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Who is most hurt by environmental degradation and abuse and who benefits? In this course we'll examine what world literature in English has to say about environmental racism, ecofeminism, and toxic colonialism. We'll also think about the social construction of nature, globalization, food justice, and overconsumption. Reading includes authors from diverse racial and national locations—Iraq, South Africa, Canada, the U.S., India, Malawi, Nigeria, China, Guatemala. Our study will focus on the intersection of environmental issues and various systems of social injustice, especially racism, sexism, and economic inequity. Primary texts include essays, poems, short stories, and three longer fictions: Helena María Viramontes, Under the Feet of Jesus, Jan Lowe Shinebourne, The Last English Plantation, and Hassan Blasim, The Corpse Exhibition and Other Stories of Iraq.  Above all, the goal of this course is to consider environmental injustice in our contemporary moment and in historical context to inspire and empower social change. We will ask: What is the role of art, narrative, and testimony in the struggle for social change and environmental justice?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Understandings of Jesus have been staggeringly diverse: esoteric gnostic savior, teacher of ethics, Stoic sage, resurrected deity who defeated death, Son of God, Jewish Messiah spurned by Jews, irreverent divine man- child, willowy effeminate sufferer, hypermasculine vindicator, vanguard of the Crusaders, apocalyptic avenger, liberator of slaves, and queer icon. Sometimes these understandings of Jesus have been explicitly contradictory: defender of capitalism &amp;amp; neoliberalism vs protector of the marginalized and forgotten. One could argue that Jesus is among the most widely (re)imagined, pliable, and repurposed figures in recorded history. This course will examine the numerous ways in which people in the ancient Mediterranean and people in the modern West have imagined and shaped Jesus in theology, visual art, and modern film. The class will begin in antiquity, as we examine the earliest depictions of Jesus, in texts and in visual art. We will read numerous ancient gospels, many of them noncanonical. The course will then consider depictions of Jesus in the writings of early Church Fathers and later portrayals of Jesus in the Middle Ages. The second half of the course will look at Jesus from the 19th to 21st centuries. We will explore Jesus as the defender of slave holders and as liberator of slaves, Jesus as feminist and Jesus as patriarch, Jesus as bastion of conservative politics and Jesus as radical revolutionary. The goal of the class is to develop an understanding of the myriad ways in which Jesus has been crafted, described, portrayed, and utilized over the centuries. This understanding necessitates an awareness for the cultural and historical context for such portrayals. Such an interest also entails an awareness of the political and social interests of those who represent Jesus in any particular manner. The course aims to help students develop critical approaches to historical figures and religious entities and to better understand how heroes, saviors, and de</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Civic Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on critical reflection, ethical thinking, and action for social change. People who think and act together to improve society must address problems of collective action (how to get members to work together) and deliberation (how to reason together about contested values). They must understand how power is organized and how it operates within and between societies. They must grapple with social conflict, violence, and other obstacles to peaceful cooperation. When tensions arise within a group, people face questions of justice and fairness, and they must confront questions about appropriate relationships to outsiders of all types. This introductory course explores ethical, political, and theological frameworks for understanding how people can and should organize themselves to improve societies. Readings are drawn from philosophy and political theory, political science, economics, the history of social movements, and other disciplines. This course provides theoretical grounding for Civic Studies majors and for other students interested in social change.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"I'm sorry" are words we've all heard and said. This class will give you the opportunity to investigate exactly what that phrase can mean and the power it holds. Through interdisciplinary perspectives, this course will examine amend-making processes with a primary focus on "the apology". We will investigate why people choose to offer or withhold an apology and the factors that complicate these decisions. Together, we will analyze contemporary apologies and non-apologies. Research from several fields including psychology, sociology, philosophy and legal studies have shown us that an apology can be used both as an instrument to repair harm and as a tool to minimize consequences. The latter part of the course will focus on the apology as a process of rebalancing and restoring justice including an examination of political and legal apologies.   Course Objectives:  •Explore and critically analyze major theoretical approaches to understanding harm, forgiveness, and making amends •Understand the social, cultural and historical forces that shape the apology process  •Integrate perspectives from multiple fields to create your own framework for evaluating an apology  •Identify the historical and cultural connections between political apologies and ideologies of justice, truth and power •Enjoy the learning process through discussion and collaboration with your classmates</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This Civic Studies course will enable students to foster a deeper understanding of the challenges of administering and achieving justice in a democratic society. Thinking About Justice 2: Law and the War in Drugs takes as its case studies the historical policies developed in relation to the cocaine and opioid epidemics. A multifaceted examination of these events fosters student understanding of their historical complexities and by extension all historical moments, cultivating a capacity for critical inquiry. Students will study historical philosophies of justice, contemporary jurisprudence, accompanied with literature, and will ultimately formulate not only their own philosophy of justice but also informed ideas about its enactment and administration. The required readings include samples from Case Law that will enable students to better understand the science and application of the law without addressing individual student experiences of cases. This course will NOT provide a forum for students to address personal legal situations. Students will write and present orally, applying their philosophy to the themes and course materials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Literatures of Justice (LoJ) is an upper-level 3-credit course that encourages students to engage with the idea of justice and the practices that borrow its name as we learn about the US criminal legal system through a multidisciplinary lens that includes historical analysis, sociology, literature, and personal narrative – those published and those shared by class members. This course examines the carceral system through the eyes of scholars and critics, many of whom are people with lived experience of incarceration. Any study of the prison system must center histories of racism and racial segregation, as well as the many voices that challenge the status quo in U.S. "criminal justice." By studying the use of incarceration specifically in the United States and by incorporating experts on incarceration as students in this course, LoJ aims to break down the carceral logics that have led to the imprisonment of over 2 million people currently in our nation, the country with the highest rate of incarceration and highest number of incarcerated people in the world. The historically recent rise of prisons in the U.S. is examined in this course in light of 1.) its central relationship to America's founding ideals emerging from European Enlightenment thought as well as 2.) the institutions of U.S. slavery, racial segregation, economic inequity, and white supremacy. Simultaneously in this class that utilizes an intersectional approach, we will ask how the carceral system polices norms related to gender and sexuality and whether current definitions of gender itself rely on a carceral logic. As part of a wider abolitionist educational and activist project, this course will, perhaps most significantly, enable students to explore and enact new ways of relating to one another and thus new ways of understanding and repairing harm.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Archival Quests" integrates the study of fiction and poetry embodying the idea of the archive with hands-on exploration of practical and ethical questions involved in archival work. We will organize, explore, research, and publicize parts of Cornell's archival record pertaining to literary history (broadly defined). Through a field trip to the University of Iowa Special Collections, we will be introduced to principles and decision-making in shaping the Science Fiction and Popular Culture collections; we will explore some fascinating publications from these collections,  practice describing them and developing a research agenda to shed light on the records.

		<Abstract>When does history begin? This course explores the question by looking at the War on Terror — a topic whose beginning is far easier to date than its ending. After considering the geopolitics of the late twentieth century, we'll study the tumultuous presidencies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, and emerge with interdisciplinary understanding the recent past.  Along the way, students will gain a foundational understanding of what it means to frame and explore a contemporary issue through a historical lens. We'll talk about the importance of evidence-based argumentation and the dangers that arise when historical knowledge is abused for political reasons. By the end of the semester, students will possess a better understanding of the real-world role that historians play outside the classroom.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2018 Winterthur Museum, Garden &amp;amp; Library was awarded an NEH grant to catalog "overlooked organic" objects in the collection through physical identification and analytical research. This project focused on cataloging a group of objects with a high standard ofaccuracy, acquiring information through visual and scientific analysis, research, and expert consultation. Where visual identification was inconclusive, peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) provided a species identification, to varying degrees of certainty, based upon existing reference tables. The grant allowed the museum to invest in the equipment required to prepare samples for PMF, while MALDI-ToF analysis is conducted at the University of Delaware's Mass Spectrometry Facility. While working on PMF analysis with infrequent or one-off users of the technique (art conservation students, material culture students, museum cataloguers), Winterthur scientists started looking into more user-friendly ways to cross-reference MALDI-ToF data of collagen markers to known, open-source collagen marker reference lists. The tool known as the "Wild Kingdom Helper" was developed to suggest possible species identifications with a certainty factor, drawing from known collagen markers for a  range of species.Users input calibrated MALDI-ToF data (m/z and intensity) into the Excel-based tool. Wild Kingdom Helper then finds collagen and keratin markers from the list and determines whether the sample is deamidated or not. The input data is compared to all m/z values in a table of species. The closest match, high or low, for each m/z is reported. Acceptance of these is based on a user defined tolerance. A list of possible species (listed from best to worst match) is then outputted, alongside the certainty factor: percentage of total markers found. The table of species is open ended for additional entries. The tool is currently still in development but has been used successfully to corroborate results from manual cross-referencing of</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Transdisciplinary Feminist Research Methods was an introductory course to feminist methodological approaches to research. It was designed for graduate students across academic disciplines who are developing research projects that address social justice issues. In this course, students learned feminist research methods that were developed by scholars, literary writers, artists, and community activists to address a range of problems from systemic racism to gender discrimination to labor exploitation. Students used multimedia texts to explore transdisciplinary approaches to research through film, maps, oral interviews, videos, books, and articles. A portion of the course was dedicated to researching injustices in TWU's own "backyard." Specifically, they engaged in archival and community research to explore the removal of Quakertown, a thriving African American community who lived across the street from present day TWU.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digital Innovation is an interdisciplinary field will prepare graduates for careers in the shifting digital landscape.  This program combine the skills and knowledge for a rapidly transforming landscape by focusing on conceptual  underpinnings, which provide adaptability, rather than the technical needs of the current, which focuses on skills that  are certain to change – perhaps before students even graduate. Although there are some technical needs associated  with conceptualizing this area, revolutionary change in areas like Voice Interface require a constellation of skills – skills not found in any one discipline.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Welcome to Mensch – Maschine: Eine Einführung in die deutschsprachige Literatur! The nineteenth century marks a time of rapid social, political, and economic change in the German speaking lands. In the latter half of the century, the German states unified into one nation and Germany quickly transitioned from an agrarian to an industrial nation. Berlin became one of the most modern metropolises at the onset of the twentieth century with its massive population growth and expansion of industry and infrastructure. German historian Jürgen Osterhammel speaks of a "transformation of the world" during the nineteenth century, with reference to historical paradigms such as the industrial revolution and the relationship between man, nature, and technology. Groundbreaking technological inventions such as the railway and the steam engine and the increasing "technologization" of human life changed more traditional ways of living; technology also became a subject matter of scrutiny in contemporary cultural production like art and literature. German literature abounds with references to the new technological age and the relationship between human beings and technology. This demonstrates the abiding relevance of literature for its potential to reflect "real life" and at the same time critically examine humanity and the ethics of human action in the world. This course will offer you an overview of major works and literary periods in German language literature, from the late nineteenth century until the present. We will contextualize our texts more specifically around the theme of human beings and technology. For this purpose, the works of fiction are paired with an additional reading that focuses on key aspects relevant to our theme. A strong emphasis will be placed in this course on student participation. We will work at building up each student's ability to speak on a high level about the themes of this course by, first, working towards a detailed understanding of each text.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The background to this three-credit practicum project will consist of readings, independent research and discussions pertaining to definitions of culture and intercultural competence. The primary informational source on culture and intercultural competence will be Riding the Waves of Culture, 4th ed. (RtW). This text will provide a foundation and an opportunity for deeper engagement with the target langauge and culture in/of the workplace. The written work will be exclusively in German and will fall into three categories:   1) Work with definitions of culture and how to look at the culture of the workplace, as well as other human interactions, through this lens (and this should include both the confirmations and surprises in interactions with the other culture);  2) Detailed descriptions of experiences and then subsequent analysis of these experiences through the cultural spectrum provided in RtW; and 3) Speculative writing about the impact of cultural awareness and intercultural competence on the confrontation with difference. Through this engagement with the target language and culture – on a theoretical as well as a practical level – the student will not only improve his spoken and written German, but his understanding of contemporary workplace culture in Germany.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The purpose of this quarter-long Story Map project was for students to practice interdisciplinary thinking across natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and indigenous ways of knowing in the international Salish Sea. Beginning in Week 1 and culminating with a project unveiling, students engaged in research about a watershed topic and collaborated with each other to tell the story of the ecology, geography, history, and archaeology, as well as the social and environmental issues affecting the Whatcom Creek Watershed. The GIS faculty lead, Ian Stacy, wove the disciplines together in an ArcGIS Story Map with the place (Whatcom Watershed) as the unifying theme.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Science and the humanities are often understood to be entirely separate domains of enquiry, each with its distinctive objects and modes of study. This course draws these two fields into conversation with each other through an interdisciplinary focus on specific materials, from their elemental structure, the technologies of their manufacture, the social and historical conditions that provoked and sustained experimentation in their substance and form, through to the impact of innovations in materials at specific historical junctures. Classes will integrate lectures across a range of disciplinary fields, with hands-on interaction with materials, and labs that will include analyses of pigment, ceramics, and glass in the collection of the Binghamton University Art Museum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course is about investigating the effects that artists elicit through the materials they use and their techniques of application. It will take an historical approach to artists' paints and painting techniques, paying particular attention to moments of intense experimentation with new formulations and transformed studio practices at specific historical junctures. How do specific artists mobilize paints, canvas, varnish, and other materials to communicate with viewers? We will explore who the artist imagines he or she is primarily engaging with and to what end, and how audiences and their manner of engagement with paintings is shaped in specific historical and cultural circumstances. Students will have hands-on experience with different kinds of paints—including tempera, oil, watercolors, and acrylics—to gain some insight into how they behave, along with techniques of application specific to particular paints and artists. No artistic expertise is necessary nor expected! During the first semester of the course, students will participate in the close analysis of several paintings from differing historical periods. We will use a range of analytic techniques and historical records to glean information concerning the pigments used, how they were applied, and whether or not the paintings are what they claim to be. The second semester of this two-course sequence will entail a guided research process whereby students will each conduct an in-depth analysis of a painting of any time period in the collection of the Binghamton University Art Museum and will together conceptualize and develop an exhibition focusing on these works that will open in the museum in the last week of the Spring semester. This annual sequence can be taken to fulfill the Aesthetics (A), Oral Communication (O), and Composition (C) general education requirements.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The educational materials, resources, and inquiry kits contained in the Warriors in Uniform database were developed with the National Social Studies C3 standards and literacy standards in mind. The inquiry kits provide a wealth of primary and secondary source materials that promote the use of inquiry, analysis, and critical thinking in both the classroom, and other learning settings. The kits encourage all learners to be actively engaged in civic life and provide a wealth of resources that are relevant to the stories of Native American Veteran participation in U.S. conflicts including their service highlights, tribal affiliations, and cultural heritage.  Although the primary audience is K-12, the K-20 secondary audience including teachers, researchers, and graduate students will find the material relevant in their research exploring Native American's roles and accomplishments in our country's military history. Materials were created and sourced through multiple organizations including the Library of Congress Teaching with Primary Sources Program, the Library of Congress Veterans' History Project, the Native American Indian Education Association (NIEA), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The National Breath of Life Self-directed Training Program is intended to provide online training offerings to Native American Community Archivists through technical linguistics content relevant to Community Archivists carrying out archives-based research for language revitalization, delivered through professional videos and interactive materials on EdApp.  The Linguistics PhD student developed learning objectives for the self-paced training program and organized the technical linguistics content into two topical areas: Sounds (phonetics and phonology) and Grammar (morphology and syntax). Each topical area was comprised of chapters with mini-lessons including an assessment lesson and an applied activities lesson. Each chapter had articulated learning objectives and a detailed script for each mini-lesson that included examples from a diversity of languages with an emphasis on Native languages. Each script was audio recorded and supplemented with animations and interactive activities developed on EdApp.    TOPIC AREA  with Chapters and minilessons  SOUNDS  Chapter 1: Introduction to human speech sounds (10 lessons)  Chapter 2: Speech sounds and how languages use them (6  lessons)  Chapter 3: Written orthographic representations (7 lessons)  Chapter 4: Beyond consonant and vowels (6 lessons)   GRAMMAR  Chapter 1: Introduction (5 lessons)  Chapter 2: Morphology (9 lessons)  Chapter 3: Syntax (9 lessons)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The goal of the CPH Summer Internship Program was to bring STEM and humanities students together to engage in an interdisciplinary hands-on co-curricular research experience. They applied public humanities-grounded research and writing approaches as well as digital tools, popular media, and data science techniques to historical and contemporary problems. The two major themes of the program were "Communication" and "Social Responsibility."  During this internship, interns worked closely with faculty mentors in researching, developing, and publishing historical content for a public audience. Student interns engaged in archival and contemporary research, worked on quantitative and qualitative data, and learned both the front and back end of web and media development.  For SYRIOS specifically, interns followed a newly developed curriculum for researching, writing, and animating short informational videos on the preservation and destruction of Syrian cultural heritage of Syria via war and the antiquities trade.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Research for Aspiring Coogs in the Humanities (REACH) Program at the University of Houston is a collaborative effort supported by the Cougar Initiative to Engage and the Office of Undergraduate Research and Major Awards. REACH will provide a year-long introductory research experience for students in humanities disciplines by connecting participants to existing undergraduate research projects at the University of Houston. From projects in collaboration with UH Libraries Special Collections, to the digital humanities, to individual faculty research projects in humanities disciplines, the REACH program provides an entry-point to hands-on scholarly inquiry.  For SYRIOS, students in year 1 followed newly developed curriculum on how to research, write, and design an online historical narrative about Syrian heritage. Students in year 2 followed newly developed curriculum about how to conduct usability/user-experience testing for a digital humanities project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this online curriculum, K-12 educators will learn about the history and the place known as Africatown. Last year, the discovery of the Clotilda was announced, the last known ship to bring enslaved Africans to the United States. This discovery made real the tale of those Africans and their descendants, some of whom still live in the village formed after the Civil War just outside Mobile, Alabama. Educators engaged with "difficult history" and the tools and strategies that will allow them to engage their own students. And, attendees created media projects as an expression of their own reflection about this encounter.  The workshop represents an outgrowth of a documentary that workshop project co-directors Professors Ryan Noble (SHC) and Joél Billingsley (University of South Alabama), along with two additional faculty, began in 2018 titled "110: The Last Enslaved Africans Brought to America." The documentary traces the journey of the Clotilda and concludes with the death of Cudjo Lewis in 1935, the last living person transported aboard the Clotilda and one of the founders of Africatown.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The NEH Awards for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions allowed me to revise a Spanish course to incorporate research-based activities into the curriculum. The collected materials, sources and subsequent research helped me to revamp and improve one of the Spanish intermediate grammar courses in our program by providing a cultural and historical thematic thread to the class SPA 2750-Intensive Intermediate Spanish Grammar Review, a course initially created for Spanish heritage speakers and offered year-round. In addition to creating a list of names to collect information about the origin and meaning of each place (as could be expected from a more traditional etymological or taxonomic study), the developed activities focus on how place-name practices have produced spaces imbued with cultural significance and social power. Therefore, the new assignments and activities created and related to the toponymic study of Colorado Spanish place names require an interdisciplinary approach including a linguistic, historical, sociopolitical, as well as a personal point of view. The different components of the project integrated into the curriculum seek to address questions such as: To what extent do official histories differ from personal stories? How do speakers pronounce these names according to the interlocutor or context? What political interests are associated with geographical regions, and what glimpses of the historical past can be derived from these names?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The ocean has inspired countless literary and visual accounts since antiquity, serving as a site for trade, recreation, strategic resources, and military conquest. However, in what some scholars have termed a "second discovery of the sea," the nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed a vast expansion of scientific and humanistic knowledge of the sea and—in sometimes overlapping spheres—a host of corresponding "new media." Drawing on a growing academic "Blue Humanities" subfield that critically examines the ocean and this history, this seminar will consider how the ocean—and more broadly, the aquatic—has been visualized, narrated, theorized, occupied, colonized, and mediated throughout modernity. This seminar is taught in an Art History department, and in turn, framed within the broader context of the Tyler School of Art and Architecture. Therefore, the class will focus on the aesthetic dimensions of the ocean and its various "media ecologies" (McLuhan, Postman) as encountered through photography, film, visual art, sound, architecture, performance, print, etc. Accordingly, our interdisciplinary approach will privilege a wide-ranging investigation of the aquatic and its associated contexts. In addition to the usual suspects in art history and art practice, our readings will draw from media studies (in particular, a strain of German media theory advanced by Friedrich Kittler, Bernhard Siegert, and others); histories of science and technology; anthropology; (eco)critical theory; indigenous knowledge; postcolonial studies, science fiction; and recent theories of the Anthropocene. Particular interest will be paid to how—like other abstract and uninhabitable spaces (outer space, the desert, the arctic poles)—the ocean has served as a site for experimental mediation and radical aesthetic possibility throughout late modernity, even as cataclysmic climate change threatens to transform the oceans and their supported systems.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our special topics seminar this semester will focus on Roman Landscapes. Roman art provides some of our earliest examples of the depiction of landscape. Although there are important precursors in Greek, Near Eastern, and Egyptian art, the earliest examples in the European tradition of what we would recognize as landscape painting emerge in Ancient Rome in the first century B.C.E. In these paintings, the landscape itself attracts the viewer's attention as much as the figures or buildings set in it.   Landscape art emerges in Rome during a fraught historical period, one in which dramatic and rapid urbanization caused the population of the city to swell to over a million inhabitants. The increasing tendency to depict peaceful natural settings in Roman art comes exactly at the same moment when the Roman countryside was being roiled by almost a century of civil war.   In our course this semester, we will try to understand when and why this focus on landscape art emerged at Rome. We will first focus on the historical background of landscape art, including the history of land use on the Italian peninsula and the particular Roman emphasis on the countryside. We will then read some of the major works of poetry from the late republic and early Augustan period that engage with issues around land and environment, including Virgil's Eclogues and Georgics. Finally, we will turn to visual landscapes, particularly the proliferation of landscape frescoes that decorated Roman houses and the similar phenomenon of carefully arranged gardens and other natural spaces that were an integral feature of Roman home design.  This course is being offered at the same time as a major exhibit at the San Antonio Museum of Art entitled "Roman Landscapes: Visions of Nature and Myth from Rome and Pompeii." Students will pay several visits to this exhibit. Thanks to the generosity of the Lennox Foundation, four distinguished scholars will also visit to give a public lecture and teach the class.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The instructor, Ms. Moriarty, has students prepare a research paper or video game that addresses the following:  Students choose a place they feel connected to (their home, a place with family history, a place they want to visit, etc).   Students research the mythology and stories of that place  Students discuss how to implement myth in a culturally respectful and accurate way  Contact cultural expert (i.e. tribal leader, author, museum staff, etc)  Class group discussion of ramifications  Students compose a paper outlining the myth, its history, and the outcomes of discussion  Students create a game design document and/or a game bringing the myth to life  The goal of the exercise is to determine how video games can be used to preserve the stories of a place, and educate and inform others about the stories and myths of the cultures of that place?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Modernization has played an important role in the evolution of man and big dams have been a symbol of modernity in developing as well as developed countries. On the one hand, they represent clean energy and economic development for the society they have also been critiqued for being the center of many political, indigenous, cultural and social conflicts. These conflicts emerge from competing interests, perception of benefits and strategies. Across the globe there are striking similarities and remarkable disparities between various dam projects. This course will focus particularly on the competing narratives of modernization and transformation within the context of a historical, policy and cultural studies approach that will help us understand the symbolic and material role the dams play in our lives as well as the interactions of dam proponents and counter proponents especially the indigenous societies across the globe whose human rights and social justice issues are at stake in these conflicts. The course explores the practices and politics of large-scale dam projects and the conflicting values, visons and relations of power that are related to them. Particularly, the course focuses on the discourses of modernity and its impact on indigenous cultures, environmental and social justice issues and water right of the tribes in the United States with special reference to the Grand Coulee Dam and across many developing societies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archival and Digital Expeditions introduces Duke graduate students to teaching with digital and physical primary sources. Each student partners with a Duke faculty sponsor to design an undergraduate course module that incorporates primary source material tailored to a specific class taught by that faculty member. Students have the option of drawing on the physical special collections of the Rubenstein Library or primary source databases and digital collections available at Duke or elsewhere. This program is based on the successful Data Expeditions program. Graduate students will be expected to spend 70-75 hours during a semester consulting with their faculty sponsor, library staff and other experts and researching, developing and testing the module. The students will work with their faculty sponsor to establish the expectations and parameters for the module prior to applying to the program. A module can take a variety of shapes and be adjusted to fit different courses, disciplines, and goals of the faculty sponsor. Each module should be designed to allow for roughly 1-2 weeks of time within an existing course or 10-20 student hours. These hours can be a combination of in-class and out-of-class activities. Modules drawing on physical special collections must include student time with the original material from the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp;amp; Manuscript Library.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Story+ is a 6-week paid summer research experience for Duke students—undergraduates and graduates—interested in exploring interdisciplinary arts, interpretive social sciences, and humanities research topics and methodologies. The program combines hands-on research with storytelling to create dynamic outcomes for diverse public audiences. In Story+, students are organized into small project teams and have the opportunity to participate in a flexible mini "curriculum" on research methods and storytelling strategies. Team projects may be led by Duke faculty, librarians/archivists or research staff or by non-profit organizations, and will be supervised on a day-to-day basis by graduate student mentors. Graduate student project managers, whose commitment is for a similar time frame with more limited hours, will receive a stipend in line with graduate student summer funding requirements and expectations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The goal of this annual grant competition is to expand opportunities for Ph.D. students to augment their core research and training by acquiring additional skills, knowledge or experiences through an off-campus summer internship. We believe such experiences will lead to better preparation/training, whether for academic positions or other career trajectories. We will consider proposals from current Ph.D. students without full summer funding for internships with a non-Duke community organization, government agency, NGO or cultural institution, related to the student's area of study. Successful applications will demonstrate how the activities associated with the proposed research experience align with the student's field of study and research interests.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This coaching program, established in 2019, helps Duke Ph.D. students from all disciplines navigate the many changes and learning curves embedded in a five-to-seven-year doctoral program. At each stage of a doctoral program (regardless of discipline), students confront new challenges and develop different competencies and skills. The Ph.D. Transitions program helps students make sense of all the changes within a safe, confidential space facilitated by a professional coach, within the company of a small group of supportive peers. Students sign up to participate for one semester in a small interdisciplinary group (usually four people) who are approximately at the same stage of their doctoral training: "Early" coursework; "Middle" exams/prospectus; "Advanced" dissertation/job search. Each group is facilitated by a professional coach, who structures the conversation based on International Coaching Federation best practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>First-year Duke Ph.D. students are invited to take part in small peer mentoring groups during their second semester on campus. Facilitated by trained peer mentoring fellows, these groups are designed to help new doctoral students flourish. No two groups will be alike. The topics, discussions and activities will be shaped by the interests and skills of the peer mentoring fellow and the participants. However, every group will provide: A safe, nonjudgmental and confidential space for participants to discuss issues related to their Ph.D. training; Multiple, fresh perspectives on issues and questions that participants bring to the groups; Support and strategies for enhancing participants' resilience and well-being in graduate school; Opportunities for participants to realize that they are not alone in the challenges they face as Ph.D. students; Ways for participants to widen their academic, professional and social networks across Duke and to mentor other Ph.D. students.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this Warrior's Path series, we will read and discuss the graphic novel, The White Donkey by Terminal Lance comic artist and Veteran, Maximilian Uriarte. We will also read comics from the collection True War Stories and the Cartoonist Veteran Project. Comics and graphic novels have a way of expressing experiences 3-dimensionally through words, visuals, and the ability to convey multiple events happening at once. In this 10-week, Vet-to-Vet dinner and discussion series, you will read comics together and engage in structured small-group conversations around military service, deployments, and coming home. The program was designed with our NEH-certified Veteran discussion leaders who facilitate these sessions. The goal is to explore and define moral injury in your own personal experience as well as come to an understanding of those veterans who had different experiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Theater is historically the Warrior's art form, invented for returning soldiers to share their experiences with their communities. There is no evidence that Shakespeare himself served although it was common during his era, and he would have had extensive second-hand knowledge. His dramatic explorations of war and service include a wide range of characters and stories. Some are historically accurate and some fictional. We will read the scenes (the lines will be fed to you by actors) and then use the stories as an entry point to discuss moral injury, service, and coming home. This Vet-to-Vet series is led by NEH-certified Veteran discussion leaders.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is the relationship between image making and the creation of new knowledge? This seminar explores the relationship between science and the visual arts during the early modern period. Drawing on a wide range of materials—paintings, illustrated albums, prints, books, maps, etc.—we will consider the ways in which artists and artworks informed knowledge-making practices in fields like natural history, medicine, astronomy, and cartography. At the same time, we will explore the impact of such disciplines on the development of ideas and practices relevant to f the work of artists and their publics. The course will follow several specific but interconnected themes and historiographic debates including: observation and the rise of naturalism; new worlds and their images; the visual culture of bodies and diseases; wonder, curiosity and the cultures of collecting; vision and its instruments; epistemic images; science, technology and visual media.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What was the role of copying in early modern art? From training exercises and artist's workshops to forgeries and counterfeits, copying practices served a variety of functions in the production, circulation, and commodification of art. This seminar looks at the historic purposes of image copying across cultures and how the long-standing theoretical debates surrounding reproduction, imitation, and authority have changed with the introduction of new technologies and media in the early modern period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This introductory course examines the long relationship between art and science from antiquity to the present. In contemporary society, art and science are often characterized as diametrically opposed however, a long history reveals that knowledge making has been inextricably linked to image making since antiquity. Drawing on a wide range of materials—paintings, illustrated albums, prints, books, maps, etc.—we will study the ways in which artists and artworks informed knowledge-making practices in fields like natural history, medicine, the study of vision, and cartography.  At the same time, we will explore the impact of such disciplines on the development of ideas and practices relevant to the work of artists and their publics. The course will follow several specific but interconnected themes, including: observation and the rise of naturalism; new worlds and their images; the visual culture of bodies and diseases; wonder, curiosity and the cultures of collecting; vision and its instruments; science, technology and visual media. This course will explore the intertwined nature of art and science: how visual images were vital to scientific progress and how art was impacted by scientific and technological developments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course will enhance your Spanish language skills by providing you with new and important contexts for the use of Spanish. Through various forms of media such as literature, non-fiction, journalism, television, and film, you will be able to address questions about bilingualism, immigration, national and cultural borders, oral history, and globalization that will expand your language proficiency. This course is not designed to "reform" your language abilities, but to add to them specific proficiencies directly related to professional activities, community interaction, and cultural awareness. Additionally, this course will introduce you to several important social and cultural themes. While the first semester of Spanish for Heritage Speakers explores questions of Latina/o identity in the United States more generally, the second semester will delve into the impact of Hispanic people, cultures, and language on the Panhandle of Texas and the High Plains, also known as the "Llano Estacado." We will explore how Spanish-speaking people travelled, settled, and worked in the High Plains, and how the deep historical and cultural roots impact the region today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course, cross-listed between English and Spanish, undergraduate and graduate, is connected to a National Endowment for the Humanities grant, concerns Hispanic culture on the high plains. In particular, we will read Spanish, New Mexican, and Mexican American texts from or concerning the era of "discovery" through the nineteenth century. Our readings will be diverse, including exploration narrative, historical scholarship, folklore, and fiction. Reading with such breadth is necessary for the "recovery" of Mexican American legacies in our region. Students in this course will have the opportunity both to learn about this legacy and to contribute new knowledge to the field.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this module, students will learn how to create personas, scenarios, and storyboards based on formative research to inform the design process. Students will gain an understanding of how to use these design representations to create user-centered designs that meet the needs of target users.  Students will be assessed based on the quality of their personas, scenarios, and storyboards and how well they reflect the user needs and goals identified in formative research. Students will also be assessed on their ability to apply the "Questions, Options, Criteria" framework to make design decisions based on the design representation</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course explores the art of storytelling as an acoustic experience. In addition to reading critical texts on listening, sound, and voice we examine a variety of kinds of aural art – from live performances (music, spoken word, literary readings) to recordings (podcasts, audiobooks, radio dramas, sound art), and study how sound is transposed into and combined with literature and the visual arts. Our inquiries into sound will also attend to the relationship between sound and power, silence, and deafness. Students will have the opportunity to visit arts institutions in the St. Louis area and to craft their own creative audio project at the end of the semester. This course is designed for First Year Students – no special background is required.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar focuses on the German language radio drama, or Hörspiel, as a unique literary genre, performance art form, and media artifact. Although often viewed today as a primitive forerunner of today's podcasts and audio-fiction, radio drama has had a long and storied tradition in German-speaking cultures. In this course, we will learn about the emergence of radio drama in the mid 1920s and explore how this art form developed in tandem with the social, political, economic, and technological transformations of the last century. Reading historical reflections by writers such as Bertolt Brecht, Walter Benjamin, Rudolf Arnheim, Theodor Adorno, and Klaus Schöning, we will interrogate how radio drama has responded to and shaped discourses on interpersonal communication in the modern age, fascist aesthetics, democratic subjectivity, collective memory, and questions of national identity and belonging. In studying radio dramas as both texts and sound documents, we will apply analytical tools from the fields of sound and media studies (including theories of listening and resonance) and transmedial narratology, and closely examine modes of adaption and techniques of acoustic staging. This seminar will also serve as an introduction to working with acoustic archival material and other historical media documentation. Radio Dramas include works by Walter Ruttmann, Günter Eich, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heinrich Böll, Frederike Mayröcker, Ernst Jandl, Heiner Müller, and Elfriede Jelinek. Sound documents will be in German, readings in German and English, discussion in English.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course addresses the role of values in technology: Who is technology for? What could it be? How does it relate to its social and historical contexts? You will be asked to think systematically and imaginatively about technology's dis/dysaffordances, that is how the design of different technologies assists and constrains everyday life. The course asks whether there is a "right" way to do technology, and if there is, how we might go about pursuing it. To explore this question, the course draws on cross-disciplinary materials taken from literature, history, sociology, anthropology, politics, and philosophy, and introduces students to the principles of design justice and inclusive design.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a course about the technologies people build to record and transmit language. We look at contemporary technologies like social media, automatic speech recognition and translation tools, and formats like Unicode. But we also look at other important technical developments — writing, the printing press, and mass communication — as well as ways that different societies and cultures have reacted to the issues these technologies have introduced, including questions of access and accessibility, ownership and privacy, the economics of these technologies, and how information and mis-information spreads. Students will explore the ways that culture and language interact, how cultural circumstances can shape linguistic understanding and interpretation, and how these technologies can in turn shape cultural practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this course, students will learn how humans and machines have interacted, become intertwined, and opposed one another throughout history, from the paleolithic era to the present. By examining a variety of texts (theory, philosophy, theater, visual art, instruction manuals, films, advertisements, podcasts), students explore how machines can enable, inhibit, and control their users in a variety of contexts. Students will also apply historically grounded knowledge to propose technological solutions to contemporary problems.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite the ways we are led to think about technologies as neutral and bias-free, this course asks you to consider how racial and gendered logics shape, and are shaped by, technological innovations (such as facial recognition, codes and algorithms, data networks, surveillance technologies, and drones). By turning to films, news articles, websites, and scholarly articles, we look beyond the marketing and promise of technologies to assess how inequalities are programmed into the automated code driving techno-intelligence. With the goal of social justice and a more ethical approach to technological design, we ask: Who benefits and who loses through these "innovations"? We will also assess the holistic picture of technological development, including what historical context inspires the development of a technology, how they affect the environment, who works to build the components, and who becomes the experts of how we address social problems. You will have the opportunity to work together to debate these issues and to consider how we might propose alternative solutions or interact differently with technologies and the worlds they offer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course explores the technologies that variously delight, extend, and command our imagination. Although we will think through the many potentials these technologies of representation open, we will also explore the social and political problems they can create or amplify. We will also collaborate on creative responses to those problems. In this iteration of the course, our focus is on technologies for visual representation. We will examine cameras, drones, apps, algorithms and other technologies that allow people to make and share images. We will ask how these technologies shape how and what we see, as well as what they keep hidden and obscure. And we will ask how power operates in the making, circulation, and consumption of pre- and post-internet visual culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Environment, sustainability, and health equity are at the center of UCR's vision for its future role in scholarship and public service. The Department of Society, Environment and Health Equity (SEHE) will offer a curriculum and research program grounded in the tools and concepts of the arts, humanities and social sciences. The department's interdisciplinary orientation and focus on local environmental and health equity needs encourage faculty and students to address complex social, medical, and environmental problems, and to prepare undergraduate students to serve the complex and diverse needs of the Inland Southern California region.  SEHE undergraduate degrees will prepare students for high-demand careers and post-graduate study in areas such as  health care, health policy, sustainability, and "green" jobs. The program integrates theoretical rigor, civic and social engagement, community service, and the methodological tools of community-engaged and community-driven research. By placing  equity and justice at the center of sustainability and environmental practices, the SEHE Department will prepare students to address cascading factors associated with deteriorating health and quality of life among impacted communities. Our graduates will receive training that will prepare them to reimagine solutions for overcoming barriers to sustainability and health equity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The on-going epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease, which originated in West Africa but has now reached Europe and the U.S., has reminded us forcefully of a premodern world many in the modern West had forgotten. Until vaccines, public health interventions, and then antibiotics helped us gained control over the major global infectious diseases, epidemics and pandemics were a fact of life. The most severe pandemic in human history was the Black Death, which struck Afroeurasia towards the end of the Middle Ages. Although total (absolute) mortality would be higher from the 1918-19 flu or the current HIV/AIDS pandemics, as a percentage of population the mortality from the Black Death (estimated between 40 and 60% in many areas) is the highest of any large-scale catastrophe known to humankind. Which makes it disconcerting that we still know so little about it. For example, while its demographic impact in western Europe and parts of the Middle East and North Africa is well known, we still know virtually nothing about its impact in Central Asia (where the microorganism, Yersinia pestis, evolved around 3000 or more years ago) or other parts of Eurasia; it may have even affected parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Genomics studies have now confirmed that Y. pestis was present in people who died during the Black Death, yet we are still unclear why the course of the disease (rate of spread, level of mortality) was so very different from plague epidemics in other periods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ms. Rose teaches first grade at Citizens of the World charter school in Los Angeles.  Her school's focus is "mindfulness" and thus her unit allows students to connect Ellington's music to feelings, movement, art, visualizing, and personal expression.  Given the rich cultural diversity of her students, Ms. Rose will teach how jazz is American music because it includes influences from so many other cultures and unifies people across the globe. Her students will explore the question "why do we listen to music."  They will dance, identify instruments, and watch videos.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Matt teaches at Darien HS in Darien, CT.  American Studies is an 11th grade interdisciplinary course co-taught with a literature and history teacher and integrates history, literature, art, architecture, music, and media in order to provide students with a broader, more rich understanding of American culture in all of its complexity.  Students spend two back-to-back periods in this course on a daily basis.  It is almost exclusively taught using primary sources.  The General Objective of this framework is for students to use jazz - its musical features, evolution, politics - as a central metaphor for the American story, and to continue to draw upon this analogy throughout the year as they deepen their understanding of key American themes and patterns of conflict:  race, the tension between the status quo and change, the fear ofg the "other", synthesis and syncretism, and innovation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ms. Whiteman teaches band and chorus at the Baker Public Schools in Baker, Montana (112 students in grades 9-12). As part of the community-wide concert, this event also included student-made visual art work, powerpoint presentations, and introductions to the music researched and written by the students.  Montana's Office of Public Instruction has an Indian Education for All which requires integrating Indian education into rigorous standards-based instruction.  For this unit, students will compare and contrast Native American flute music with examples from Ellington's music.&amp;#x0D; this Unit was so successful that the principal is going to have a district wide focus around music or a musician every year!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ms. Cox teaches at Two Rivers High School in Ogden, UT which is an alternative high school for students with attendance, academic, or disciplinary issues.  During January/February of 2015, students at Two Rivers will collaborate with students/faculty at Weber State University, engaging in a multi-school, whole-community study of the legacy of Duke Ellington.  Using jazz and the life of Ellington, we will embark on a journey to uncover and understand Ellington's lasing legacy while considering our own.  (What will our life say to others? How weill we be remembered? How do others see us now? How would we like the world to see us?)  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In our journey through the life of Ellington (and the Harlem Renaissance), students will&amp;#x0D; read literature and poetry, listen to music, respond in writing to both literature and music, create artwork, learn dances, "taste" Harlem, explore Harlem and Duke through images and documentaries, examine the economic, social and political contexts (ESP), while considering our own.  Loren Schonberg from the National Jazz Museum in Harlem will visit our school to celebrate and extend our study of Ellington.</Abstract>

Students will participate in various forms of musical expression, demonstrate an understanding of musical concepts, display an awareness of the interrelationship between music and society, and display an understanding and appreciation of music as an art form.  My unit will follow our week of learning at the NEH workshop, including using "Sir Duke" by Stevie Wonder to introduce Ellington, I will teach scat singing and improv as we were taught by Loren Schonberg at the National Jazz Museum, do ring shouts as Brian Torff taught us, do the LIndy Hop because not only do you feel the music, it provides wonderful social skills for out students.  At Midsummer Nights Swing, 100% of the people were smiling, laughing, and enjoying each other's company.  Yohuru Williams historical analysis using ESP (economic, social and political contexts) will be applied, as well.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In addition, I work with the Dept of Defense Dependents Schools European Jazz Seminar and we teach and perform Ellington pieces once every four years.  I can now take a leadership role in this and help the teachers convey to their students the importance of Ellington.  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Third, I perform in a big band with Italian musicians and can teach them about Ellington and Ellington's music, as well.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Spring 2015 Globalization Reading Group again chose Manfred B. Steger's seminal work, Globalization: A Very Brief Intro-duction for the second time. This text is particularly appropriate for Montgomery College because of our location near the capitol and be-cause of our diverse student and employee body. Our students, even more so than other community college students, are diverse, coming from over 160 countries, the District of Columbia and surrounding counties. We work so hard to serve our students and community and awaken in them an appreciation of our discipline that we often take for granted our own growth. As such, the reading group was open to both faculty and staff from all three campuses. The Book Group offered Montgomery College employees the oppor-tunity to perspective take and think critically and civically about our place in the world. The diversity of the group allowed for dynamic in-teractions and discussions along with the sharing of useful resources. We had three face-to-face meetings lasting two hours each, and one virtual meeting via Blackboard Community. During each of these meetings, we discussed two chapters of Globalization: A Very Brief Introduction. We began each face-to-face meeting with each partici-pant sharing some thoughts, reactions, and questions about the chap-ters. For the virtual meeting, participants posted a response to a facili-tator prompt in the designated Blackboard Community and at least one original reaction / question / presentation of materials with ac-companying explanation, related to the chapters being discussed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Two fellowships are being offered. Faculty can apply for fellowships focused on Revising Individual Courses or Creating Learning Communities. The Revising Individual Courses Fellowship will guide faculty through the process of globalizing a humanities course that they currently teach.  The session series will be supplemented and enriched by stimulating guest speakers, readings, and discussions related to the interdisciplinary and global aspects of the humanities. In the Learning Community Fellowship of the Global Humanities Institute, faculty partners will integrate and internationalize a pair of courses in order for students to study a current or enduring "big question" of interdisciplinary humanities.  Fellows will be guided in selecting a compelling theme for the learning community and identifying global and cross-cultural approaches to examining it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As one of the Global Humanities Institute's (GHI) initiatives to bring the world to Montgomery College (MC) students, last semester Spanish learners engaged in a virtual cultural exchange with Modern Language majors from the University of El Salvador (UES).  Born out of connections made during the July 2013 GHI workgroup trip to El Salvador, the effort was a collaboration between the UES Dean of Humanities, GHI Director Rita Kranidis, MC Instructional Designer Tom Cantu and the staff from Media Resources, two UES English professors and MC Spanish professors Shelley Jones and Carla Naranjo.   &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; MC participants included students from elementary through intermediate level Spanish while all of the UES students involved were English or Modern Language majors.  Students from both countries posed questions in their native languages for their exchange partners to consider before the actual virtual meeting.  In the case of the intermediate Spanish students, responses were given in Spanish, integrating language production practice with the cultural aspects of the exchange.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1492, the scholar Antonio de Nebrija published the first grammar of the Spanish language, dedicated to Isabella I, of Castille. When the queen asked why she would want a work like this, Nebrija responded: "Majesty, language is the perfect instrument of empire." The conquest of the Americas, which would change history forever and precipitate the modern era, is inextricably bound up with language and its various modes of transmission. This course explores a multicultural history of the technologies of "writing," broadly understood, in North America--Native American, Spanish, French, and English, from 1500 to 1800. We will study three strands of that history: The Pre-columbian world and the oral vs. scribal debate; Conquest and religion, especially Puritanism/Protestantism; European settler colonialism, especially relations with Indigenous peoples and Atlantic slavery. In the second half of the course, we will focus on four figures: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Samson Occom, and Phillis Wheatley, all of whom used writing in different ways to make "revolutions." Finally, we will consider the recent turn to digital archives and work with the Occom Circle and other digital sites to explore how digital tools open networks of associations masked by maleness and whiteness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Five assignments in a semester-long CS-1-like course named Computing for Poets to introduce students to programming within one area of the digital humanities: the application of computing to the study of digitized texts. The course exposes students to leading markup languages (HTML, CSS, XML) and teaches computer programming (Python) as a vehicle to explore and "data mine" digitized texts. Programming facilitates top-down thinking and practice with computational thinking skills such as problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and experimental design - topics that humanities students in our experience rarely see. A learning objective for students in this course is to articulate how computational analyses of digitized texts enables both a "close reading" of a single text and as well as a "distant reading" of many texts across time. The goal for each student is to master enough programming to modify digitized texts to help in a computational experiment that explores a question of a text or set of texts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Course Description: &amp;#x0D; The field of graphic medicine is a new and vibrant community of comics artists, humanities scholars, public health and health professionals. Graphic medicine is a term coined by physician, cartoonist, and medical humanities scholar Ian Williams and is defined as "the role that comics can play in the study and delivery of healthcare" (Graphicmedicine.org 2013). Williams launched the graphic medicine website in 2007 as an effort to recognize the increasing number of illness narratives in comic form since the mid 1990s. This class will take an anthropological lens to the field of graphic medicine and the graphic narratives that constitute the material of interest for GM.  Examining the intersections of the "ordinary, chronic, and cruddy" and how they are entangled in biomedical hegemonies and medical technologies in the context of late liberalism, we will consider how graphic narratives are embedded in processes of biomedicalization, how the narratives are empowering or fostering conditions of endurance or exhaustion, and what anthropology and its methods can contribute to GM. Importantly, while the medium we are examining is visual, we are particularly interested in how graphic narratives intersect with scholarly conversations in the study of illness narratives and narrative medicine.  &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>COURSE OVERVIEW: This is the third quarter of the CHASS First Year Experience course sequence on "Life Narratives." Our class focuses on storytelling and the power of stories to transform our thinking about the world with attention to matters of health and wellness for both individuals and society. The core questions: What is the foundation for effective storytelling? How do stories convey the importance of a problem or situation in a way that facts and data alone cannot? Why and how do stories create such a powerful sense of connection between storyteller and audience/community? How do we create stories that might inspire personal transformation and social change? How do we tailor storytelling for various realms (live performance, video, digital media)? How do we use storytelling to communicate scholarship and research? Ultimately, as a class, how will we create a storytelling event that shares the most important lessons gained from this year's CHASS course sequence on the study of life narratives? &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our objective this quarter is to dig into the history of race, eugenics and medicine in modern history. We will use a case study or microhistory method, whereby we will seek to deeply understand one historical event as a window onto broader contexts and questions. Our focus is the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis, which took place in Macon County, Alabama from 1932-1972.&amp;#x0D; This will not be an ordinary history class. The core of the quarter will be a game: a simulation of a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in 1974 by surviving study subjects and their descendents. The first few class sessions will be devoted to understanding the historical context of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study: eugenics, racial science and racism. &amp;#x0D; Then the game begins: each of us will be assigned a role to play in the simulation, and we will speak, write and make decisions in that character. Each party in the lawsuit will attempt to convince the jury and the public to decide in its favor. The outcome may or may not replicate what really happened, as we will see at the game's end. However, the goal is not to recreate history. Rather, it is to fully immerse our selves in these peoples' lives, their choices, their values and the world they moved in.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Increased concern for the emotional component of doctoring has led to a revival in medical schools' inclusion of the humanities into their curriculum.  With the intention of fostering empathy, many medical schools offer reflective writing as a 3rd-year selective.  Although this has shown some positive outcomes, reflective writing requires complex writing skills that many students lack. Educators may assume that students can write easily and fluently about their emotions, but such writing is a skill, not a given.  Brief and late writing interventions limit success to those already inclined to the activity.  Further, by focusing solely on empathy, such programs ignore the potential power of writing as a multifaceted cognitive tool. This paper will present an ongoing curriculum intervention that is aimed at fully exploiting the potential of writing to develop observational, analytical, and other cognitive skills. The program we designed, a 3-year writing program for medical students, fully integrates writing into the curriculum.  This mandatory program introduces an innovative writing technique called Powerwriting to first-year students, when they use it as they learn patient documentation.  During their second and third years, students use writing toward recognizing biases and long-term consequences of treatment plans.  By the third year, all students are ready to use Powerwriting to reflect on difficult events, such as the deaths of patients.  Moving in a scaffolded curriculum, from information processing to critical analysis to reflective exploration, our approach gives students a powerful writing tool for processing all kinds of information, from humanistic to medical.   &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course offers a long survey of cultural representations of the multiethnic geographical region understood now as the U.S./Mexico borderlands.  How did the modern apparatus of the U.S./Mexico border come to be?  What are the cultural practices, social understandings, and forms of economic traffic that both contribute to its enactment of national division and difference, and are in turn regulated by its legal enforcement of political inclusion and exclusion? And how might we fashion a critical dialogue that best negotiates enduring problems of democracy and difference, freedom and security, and regional autonomy within a transnational and multiethnic space that yet belongs to an increasingly integrated and borderless world?  Examining historical clusters of texts that intersected public and private realms from the early 17th Century to the 21st Century, students will gain insight into these matters by investigating the multiple practices of social definition and political enforcement, national myth-making, and cultural boundary inscription that have contributed collectively to the construction of borderlands discourse over time.  Guiding and informing this endeavor will be the development of an intellectual repertoire of critical methods through close engagement with a host of theoretical texts preponderantly from beyond the strict purview of literary and cultural studies as such, but which promise to foster sophisticated understandings of the traffic between varieties of cultural and political representation, including epic poetry, literary fiction, oral storytelling, government documents and treaties, travel narratives, diaries, letters, visual art, and film.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite the contemporary narrative of globalization that pushes us to believe that we are moving towards a world citizenship that transcends regional and national loyalties, the paradox is that contemporary globalization has generated a proliferation of borders that impacts migratory movements, guides capitalist investment, and influences political life.  Borderlands, whether historic or contemporary, have relied on various forms of legal logic to underpin their existence. This course looks at the laws, assumptions, and consequences of legal rulings in creating borders, classes and citizens. First, "Discourses of Displacement" will explore the idea of "borders" as a method that will allow us to explore new perspectives on the process of nation-building.   We will question how the idea of borders invites us to reassess political concepts of citizenship, sovereignty, and the function of law as an equitable social mechanism.  Lastly, we will simultaneously explore representations in literature and film of borders challenge us to reexamine our ideas about justice, citizenship, and the precariousness of national identity</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This graduate course explores the on-going creation of the US-Mexico border as well as the diverse ways in which migrants have negotiated crossing the US-Mexico border from the 1880s through the end of the 20th century. The dividing line was created following the US-Mexico War and the signing of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. As border scholars have argued, however, border making does not end with the creation of a border line. During the time period covered by this class, the border shifted from a relatively open border to one increasingly surveilled and controlled. Immigration laws such as the 1917 Immigration Act, the 1924 creation of the Border Patrol, and the implementation of operations such as Operation Hold the Line in 1993 and Operation Gatekeeper in 1994 hardened the borderline. Yet, unequal economic developments, US federal policies, as well as political and social instability have continued to motivate on-going movement across the border. The border and border crossers remain controversial today as they have for over a century.&amp;#x0D; The course will combine historical analysis of the border with personal accounts, bringing a human face to this history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course will analyze the juncture between the historical and political evolution of the border and personal narrative in order to decipher the ways in which the rhetoric of belonging and border security intersect. This class advances the belief that in order to understand the policies behind border security we must utilize both a micro and macro approach, while looking at changes in policy over time and space. &amp;#x0D; In order to provide the broadest possible perspective, therefore, this class will start with an inquiry into the global idea of security, its meaning and utility, and of the ethics of membership (i.e. policies of inclusion and exclusion).</Abstract>

Whether framed as humanitarian, immigration or security crises, the stories of these children cross interdisciplinary borders for graduate-level research in border/national security and the humanities.</Abstract>

Is Race everything?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; These and similar questions inform readings, discussion, and writing in English 291. Together, we  explore the nature of race from classical antiquity through modern day in philosophy, science, art, and literature. Together, we explore the variety of disciplinary approaches to the study of race. We also consider the historical, social, and economic pressures that have consolidated the idea of race. Together, we ask: what is racial difference?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The course is divided into four units, reflecting three major elements of racial discourse: physical difference, geographical difference, and religious difference, along with a unit dedicated to our main objective: to develop a working definition of race.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar focuses on aspects of European transatlantic migration and settlement from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries.  It attempts to integrate narratives of origin and settlement by exploring, on the one hand, circumstances the various motives that led Europeans to leave their native lands and forge new lives in an alien environment, and on the other, how their social, cultural, and political experiences in the "Old World" shaped their encounter with the "New."  Special attention is devoted to themes that have animated work in the field of Atlantic history, including transatlantic migration, encounters between European and non-European peoples, the environmental and epidemiological impact of European settlement, religious dimensions of European expansion, the rise of slavery, and the Atlantic revolutions of the later eighteenth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Each course module was developed by a faculty member from the Community College of Beaver County, with guidance from University of Pittsburgh faculty, through the NEH-sponsored "Bridging Cultures" partnership project between CCBC and Pitt. The modules were designed in response to a series of faculty development sessions led by Pitt's Center for Russian and East European Studies. In developing the modules, CCBC faculty made connections between East European history, culture, and contemporary life and the important questions of their respective disciplines.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; These modules are freely available for faculty from other institutions to view, download, and use as models for internationalizing their own courses or as a way of discovering material that may benefit their students. Some of the modules are accompanied by a personal reflection written by the module designer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lesson will recreate one of the experiences of the 2015 Monuments of Rome in English Culture NEH Summer Teacher Institute. Students will explore a selection of Roman monuments and their history, essentially learning to "read" the messages the monuments are meant to convey. Students will then compare these messages with modern monuments connecting past to present.&amp;#x0D; In Lesson 1 (Introduction to Classical Monuments) students will learn about several "tropes" or symbolic features that appear in classical monuments over time. In Lesson 2 (Understanding Classical Influence), students will apply this basic knowledge as they analyze the purpose of these Classical "tropes" in modern state and national monuments. Finally, students will select one of the state and local monuments to research in depth. The summative project asks students to analyze the architectural details of the monument as well as its history and purpose. Students will take a "guided tour" of the monuments in the Library as they present (and view) final projects, just as the NEH teacher scholars presented monuments to our institute peers at the ancient sites.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The classical tradition of rhetoric traces its history from Greece with Plato and Aristotle through to Rome and Cicero. The physical spaces constructed during these time periods, moreover, serve as a tangible reflection of the rhetorical styles, structures, and tenets of these early philosophers and orators.&amp;#x0D; Both Cicero in the waning days of the Roman Republic and Augustus in his rise as Emperor of Rome employ rhetorical strategies and devices that are simultaneously reflected in the physical spaces around them.&amp;#x0D; In studying the visual depiction of rhetoric in conjunction with the written form, students will build visual frameworks for identifying written rhetorical strategies and analyzing their use.&amp;#x0D; In Lesson 1, students will explore and develop relationships between several related primary sources in order to build a synthesized argument on Augustus's rhetorical strategies. In Lesson 2, students will follow the same format with new source materials from Cicero to build independence in the process and develop greater understanding of rhetorical analysis. Finally, in Lesson 3, students will apply the skills developed in Lessons 1 &amp;amp; 2 to write a rhetorical analysis essay.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Pantheon is a building in Rome, Italy that has undergone numerous transformations throughout the years. This building has gone from being a pagan temple, to being used by local vendors to sale goods on the porch, then back to a place of worship in the form of a Christian church. Regardless of its purpose, the Pantheon is a fine example of ingenious architecture, even by today's standards.&amp;#x0D; In this lesson, students will learn about the history of the Roman Empire and the effects it has had on the Pantheon in the past 2,000 years. They will focus on the aesthetics of the building with the help of the elements of art and principles of design. Students will be asked to identify particular visual components of the Pantheon and see what modern-day architecture it may have influenced. Students will also do a hands-on project which will require them to write about, design and construct their own personalized building.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Pantheon is remarkable for its size, construction, and its design. Two factors that have contributed to its success over time are: the quality of mortar used in the concrete and the careful selection and grading of the aggregate materials which range from basalt, tufa, pozzolana, and pumice.(2) Pozzolana is a fine, chocolate-red volcanic earth, which when mixed with hydrated lime forms an excellent cement that will set well even under water. Pozzolana beds are found at Pozzuoli, near Naples, and around Rome.(1) This unit will cover concepts of Materials Science and Technology and give students the opportunity to learn about cement hydration, material properties, and making concrete. Concrete is important to study in the context of chemistry because of its widespread uses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This seminar examines the relationships between media and cultural change in the historical and political context of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War.  Adopting a cultural studies perspective, we will explore how the privatization and commercialization of the media industries led to changes in media content and, in turn, helped to bring about major shifts in the cultural and political environment of post-communist societies.   The topics we will discuss include: the role of media ownership in journalistic freedom, the rise of advertising and consumerism in the former communist world; the media's role in changing ideas about national identity, political participation, and gender relations; and the enduring legacies of communism and the Cold War on today's cultural and political realities in the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca's 1555 imprint of his expeditions in both the North American and South American continents, titled "Comentarios," this independent study course follows the history of the commentary as a literary genre from classical antiquity into early modern Spain. Graduate student Jerusa Carvajal produced a term paper on the subject and served as the stepping stone to her pursuing doctoral studies with emphasis on the Spanish literary production of 16th- and 17th-century Spain. She is currently writing a Ph.D. dissertation on early modern Spanish drama of historical material.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Criminals are people who break the law -- In theory. How do people become criminals (with regard to biological, cultural, and economic influences)? What happens to them in the criminal justice system, and how does the system shape the definition of "criminal"? We will also discuss "criminals of conscience" from Thoreau and Gandhi to Edward Snowden. The course will emphasize reading but will also engage with other media, including films, podcasts, and visual art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We spend much of our lives working, or preparing ourselves to work.  We spend much of the rest of our time pursuing leisure.  But what are our goals in doing so?  How important is it for our work to be meaningful?  Is leisure simply the absence of work, or something more?  And what role do each of these play in a fulfilling life? &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This course will work to respond to these questions through the lenses of philosophy, sociology, religion, and economics.  We will examine conceptions of work ranging from the idea that it is a necessary evil to the idea that it is a form of religious devotion.  We will consider conceptions of leisure ranging from the view that it consists of relaxation, to the view that it is an activity one cannot engage in without prior self-development. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; From Aristotle to Adam Smith, from Martin Luther to Max Weber, we will study various accounts of what work and leisure have been, and what their ideal forms might be.  The course will conclude by considering the coming age of technologically automated physical and mental labor, and its impact on the future of work and leisure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course examined the visual art that Dante experienced. It was inspired by the experience of first-time seeing these works in the Institute sessions.&amp;#x0D; Akash Kumar writes, "On the curriculum front, my course this past quarter on the Commedia was very much inspired by the institute, especially in featuring the history of visual representation and aspects of material culture, from sites that we visited and manuscripts that we looked at together all the way to Birk's 21st-century illustrations. A curricular goal that started in part last quarter was having students doing collaborative digital annotations of canti...the eventual goal is to teach a course that results in a student-produced annotated digital edition of the poem."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Special topics courses in the English department give students and faculty the opportunity to explore texts and topics that are not included in the regular curriculum. This particular course—Epic Journeys—will focus on three epics from the western literature tradition: Homer's Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, and Dante's Divine Comedy. The course will approach these works through the lens of genre by comparing and contrasting epic characteristics in each and through the lens of metaphor by comparing and contrasting the central metaphor of the journey in each.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Course Description: &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This seminar is designed as an introduction to the major developments in the legal history of photography in transatlantic (US-UK especially) society from the first law cases involving photography in 1840 through to contemporary legal debates about such topics as cameras in the courtroom, sexting, surveillance, photographing police, dash cam and body cam videos, admissibility of photographs as evidence, obscenity and moral boundaries of subject matter, and copyright. A range of secondary historical and theoretical writings will anchor the discussions, but the course will focus primarily on student analysis and interpretation of primary and archival sources (texts of legal cases, law reviews and dissertation, news articles and documentary and video footage). Students will gain knowledge of how legal history has shaped the history of photography, and new perspectives on the historical origins of contemporary issues in photography and digital imaging. It should be of interest especially to history majors and non-majors who are interested in law, photography, and culture and will also contribute to the "Visual and Material Studies" module in History.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course introduces students to vital questions on the role of the human body and face in Western Art, from Antiquity to the present. It addresses the per se interdisciplinary nature of body images, profane and sacred, in different media and art forms, thus familiarizing students with a broad range of subjects,artworks, and cultural practices and thought patterns. Its chronologically arranged themes foster both the students' sense of historical differences and developments as well as changing notions of the human body and its 'meanings' - from the visceral to the virtual, as metaphor and matter, and as subject and object in visual representation. The course familiarizes students with central ideas of what it means to be human, beyond the Cartesian dichotomy of body and mind, and it will help them to critically evaluate the intellectual and cultural concepts behind different forms of body images. The course is art historical but also includes interdisciplinary components and overlaps with Religious Studies, Theatre Studies, History and the History of Medicine, Gender and Sexuality Studies and Psychology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This series explores the complex, and often uneasy, relationship between black Americans and the American justice system. Developed by project scholar Leroy Rowe, Assistant Professor of African American History and Politics, University of Southern Maine, and librarian consultants Elizabeth Hartsig (Portland Public Library) and Holly Williams (Pittsfield Public Library), the books selected for Race and Justice in America provide historical analyses of selected events, court rulings, and public policies that help to explain the black American struggle for citizenship, civil rights, and equal treatment under the laws.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Race and Justice in America also explores the changing boundaries and content of state and national citizenship. The core questions that the series engages are: how was membership in the social and political community defined for African Americans and whites in the United States? How have those definitions changed over time? And in what ways did individuals and communities exercise rights as citizens and experience those rights differently?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Pioneers and Frontiers is a reading and discussion series designed for participants in the Maine Humanities Council's NEW BOOKS, NEW READERS program: low-literacy adults  who are working to improve their reading and those who are not in the habit of reading.  The books are carefully chosen from the best of children's literature to relate to participants' own lives and to broaden their perspectives in discussions led by a humanities scholar/facilitator.  It is an important part of the program that participants receive the books to keep.  Participants come from adult basic education, GED programs, Literacy Volunteers, family literacy programs, and correctional facilities around the state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>AH 491 H: ART AND AESTHETICS IN THE THIRD REICH&amp;#x0D; One of the most murderous regimes in history, the Third Reich was also one of the most deeply invested in all areas of art and aesthetics. Beyond the realm of producing propaganda in every medium, from posters to film to processions, the Nazis stole or destroyed millions of works of art throughout Europe, planned the redesign of many major cities, held the most highly attended "art" exhibit ever held and attempted to control every facet of the visual arts. This course proposes that we cannot fully understand National Socialism without understanding the aesthetic ideology of the party and of Adolf Hitler and shows how "culture was not only the end to which power should aspire, but the means of achieving it."&amp;#x0D; Topics to be explored include Hitler's youth as a struggling painter in Vienna and his rejection from the Art Academy; the systematic expropriation of Jewish art collections and the works of foreign museums; Albert Speer's plans for a newly designed Berlin; the 1937 Degenerate Art exhibit; the carefully designed parades, processions and rallies; and recent law cases to have stolen works of art restored to their rightful owners. The course ends with a look at memorials and museums dedicated to the Holocaust and ask whether it is possible for art, in any form, to illuminate one of the darkest chapters in human history,</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This module is part of a larger reimagining of my English 101: Composition I course. The objective of this new style is to rewrite ENGL 101 into a course that combines global material with English composition skills, presented in a modular format with content units that can be switched out year to year according to the needs of the instructor, the interests of the students, or College-wide projects for regional study. This approach intends to heighten students' global consciousness, making them more culturally aware, and instill in them a greater sense of world citizenship. As such, this reimagining is in line with CCP's Mission Statement</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As any ESL teacher knows, ESL students comprise numerous nationalities with a variety of cultural backgrounds, including a good number from Asian and African cultures. Subject matter based on Indian and African topics would therefore be of interest to students from these backgrounds as well as to other ESL students who wish to gain more intercultural perspectives. An ESL classroom can be said to be a multi-cultural microcosm of the world and students often have a natural interest in familiarizing themselves with their classmates' backgrounds and cultures. In addition, a goal for most ESL students is to learn about the country where they are learning English; thus, another component of the module focuses on the United States. Students at this level must improve their skills in writing various kinds of essays, paraphrasing, summarizing, and critical thinking. Students will practice these skills with embedded assignments in the context of rebellions against the British in India, Nigeria, and the U.S.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This module will integrate the significant theater and performance forms of South Asia into our student's understanding of theater history, cultural theory and practice. One of the issues with survey courses is the inevitable generalizing because of time constraints that lead to a superficial presentation of content and analysis. One approach is to include unifying forms and theories to explore multiple historical theater forms and practices. Concepts and constructs of nationalism and its relationship to identity can provide a framework for examining how the stage and scripts support a study and critique of national cultures and identity. All cultures present and represent their history and values in performance. Disruptions of notions of history or cultural and social mores are also often performed, for example, in dada or intercultural performance.  An exploration of significant scripts and theatrical periods and styles, reflecting multiple styles of performance in South Asia, will contribute to student's understanding of the history and culture of particular regions and groups. These studies will also introduce students to conflicts and issues, both historical and current, in South Asia. Additionally, students will increase their understanding of the relationship of theatrical practices and genres historically and in intercultural performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rationale: The purpose of this module is to discuss the continued custom of arranged marriages in order to introduce South Asian cultural values to advanced ESL writing/ reading students. It is an excellent way to bridge cultures in a course designed to improve ESL students' writing, reading and critical thinking skills. An arranged marriage is a custom that is not understood by many people across the globe. It is important for students to examine the custom of arranged marriages because it helps them to understand the values, beliefs and practices of people who come from other cultures. It helps them to understand the concept of marriage from a broader perspective and communicate empathetically with people from other cultures. The students will learn how to write reaction papers, conduct a debate, write a persuasive essay, and a critical analysis essay about the topic. They will read chapters about arranged marriages, view recent films, video clips and read a novel. The module will be four weeks in duration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Course Description: This course explores the major historical design movements and theoretical concepts of architecture and interiors from pre-historical times through the end of the Renaissance (ca. 1600). Lectures and discussions will explore ways of interpreting built forms, as well as illustrative sculpture and painting, so that specific building projects can be understood in the context of the major issues that are central to each historical period. Interior spaces as well as exterior forms will be investigated in order to illuminate the relationship between the container and the contained. While this course focuses predominantly on western architecture, Islamic, Asian and indigenous American architectural history will be investigated as well. This is a writing intensive course.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course teaches undergraduates how to research and how to incorporate research materials into a sustained argument having the form of an academic essay. To assist students to these ends, I have chosen the topic of violence and its variants: pacifism, non-violent direct action, etc. Students are assessed primarily through two research papers which they draft and complete. The first explores the social and psychological origins of violent behavior. The second asks whether violence (or non-violence) continues to be useful as an agent of social change. I have therefore written two modules pertaining to South Asian materials for this course. The first revisits the idea of non-violence as understood by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The second looks at the uses and regrets which attend violent action in the Indian epic The Mahabharata. For a more-nuanced and complete look at how the South Asian materials are integrated with texts originating elsewhere, I refer the reader to the "Introduction of Modules for Faculty" section below.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What did the Civil War do to its veterans? How did they cope with the horrors they suffered and inflicted? What trauma did soldiers bring home to their families after 1865? How relevant are these stories to our present?  Robert Buffum makes us confront each of these questions. To help guide thoughtful discussions in classrooms and communities, CWGK has assembled a guided primary source reader that presents the story of a veteran struggling with loss, physical scars, substance abuse, a crumbling domestic life, and lack of support from the government he fought to defend.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course, on the "long Twentieth Century" of American realism and muckraking will consider the American muckraking tradition, as a literary tradition, with particular attention to the ways in which muckraking writers have employed rhetorical and realist techniques to persuade readers and engage audiences. Our discussion will begin with the question of why slave narrators are not considered muckrakers, using "cultural work" as an analytical framing device, and continue with some of the earliest works of the accepted tradition of American muckraking, such as Nellie Bly's "madhouse" exposé (1887), Jacob Riis's How the Other Half Lives (1890) and the American muckrakers associated with McClure's magazine: Upton Sinclair, Ray Stannard Baker, Lincoln Steffens, and Ida Tarbell.  Attention to a second generation of mid-century muckrakers will begin with social protest works which expose social conditions but are considered far from muckraking; Fannie Hurst's sentimental stories (1916; 1925) and Richard Wright's classic work of realism, Native Son (1940).  With those works as a backdrop, our reading will then track two very different social activists, Rachel Carson (widely credited with instigating the environmental movement) and radical writer Jessica Mitford (whose advocacy of working and poor people earned her the honorific "Queen of the Muckrakers").  Our reading will continue with more recent works of popular muckraking, such as Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed (2001), Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation (2001), and Naomi Klein's No Logo (2009), and conclude with issues raised by the recent case of The WikiLeaks Files (2015).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the fall of 2017, Rosenbaum, Kinnahan, and Churchill each taught a course relevant to the project, giving us an opportunity to pilot a cross-institutional project with students and digital librarians at our respective schools (Emily McGinn, UGA; Gesina Philips, Duquesne; Sundi Richard, Davidson). The "Biography Project," as it came to be called, involved students at Davidson, Duquesne, and UGA in researching and writing short biographies of figures connected to the historic avant-garde (chiefly Dada, Futurism, Surrealism) who were associated with Loy. A truly collaborative effort, we established and followed a shared template for the project and involved students in peer-reviews of at least two biographies authored by students from other schools. In workshops conducted by digital librarians at each school, students considered the technical and conceptual particularities of gathering and "cleaning" data, writing for a digital platform, and conducting peer review through the open platform Hypothes.is.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Course Description:  This course explores the place and purpose of a great variety of Christian liturgical music in the European urban environment, its ever evolving and changing nature, and the economy of music as demonstrated by the practices of lay benefaction, from 700-1700.    Expanded Course Description: In medieval and early modern Europe, Christian church music conveyed religious doctrine and often political messages by painting texts with sound, dramatizing liturgical movement or filling space, evoking devotion, memories, or emotions, and mirroring heaven, or hell. Often regulated and mostly fixed in writing (after ca 850), religious liturgical music was usually performed by professionals and taught or composed only by the best of those initiated in that art, even though most levels of society heard it. In this course, we explore Christian music in selected European cities, from 700-1700. We will identify the music heard by different religious communities and social classes, in spaces including cathedrals and parish churches, court and private oratories, monasteries and convents, and guild chapels and hospitals. Particular emphasis will be given to the place and purpose of liturgical music, its ever evolving and changing nature, and the economy of music as demonstrated by the practices of lay benefaction. Finally, we will discuss successes and failures in early church music in the urban environment and consider how these might improve music and its patronage in modern urban churches in the United States.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing on substantial scholarship in English, a wide range of historically informed sound recordings, my experience working in archives of this period across Europe (most recently Dresden, Hamburg, Utrecht, Lyon, Reims and others), and my preparations for a new historical performance project, I wish to compare the history of music in different cities in order to determine what is unique to particular cities, regional, or widespread, beginning with Rome (also Jerusalem and Istanbul for comparison), and closing with Venice, Amsterdam, Vienna, Paris, and again Rome. The topics to be discussed will be determined by the class, but can include strictly historical explorations of the professionalism of composing, performers of different ages (choirboys, adults), genders, and social standing; listeners, the spaces of musical performance and their social design, the economy of music: its producers, consumers, and advertisers; ethnomusicological approaches; philosophical approaches to the purpose of music, repetition vs creativity, music as sign, etc.; scientific approaches to music: the makeup of early instruments such as the organ; the use of music theory in education; numbers and notation; symbolism in public and religious music; and a range of other topics, including music manuscripts and archives, the writing, printing, transmission, and marketing of music, chant and liturgy, public ceremonies including processions and theater, and so on. There will be some transcription from early notation and some singing and acting in class. I also hope to organize a visit to the National Gallery of Art and bring in a speaker from the Art Department to discuss music in early paintings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Research team received $50,000 grant from The UPS Endowment Fund for Transportation, Logistics and Urban Issues or multi-university research and curriculum development.  The history of roads and the history of postal systems are often invisible elements of the past because they seem so obvious. Roads lead somewhere but not everywhere; they make local, regional, and long-distance communities, economies, systems of governance, and human mobility possible. Yet we do not often think that they have a history. Similarly, despite the existence of postal museums in different parts of the world, including the National Postal Museum at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., most people never contemplate how postal systems came into being. In fact, the creation and control of infrastructure providing reliable delivery of mail is a key means of fostering and controlling society across distance. It requires logistical planning, an understanding of how people and things move through space and the rate at which they can travel by various means of transportation. During the early modern period (1500-1800), individuals and communities experienced dramatic changes in communication and transportation, establishing practices, institutions, and infrastructure that opened up new political and economic possibilities, and changed the way people understood the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This low stake assignment was developed upon attending to the Seminar Enriching Latin American Studies. This seminar helped me to understand cultural processes in Latin American in a deeper manner. It particularly helped me to be more aware of the connections between the Marvelous Real -as Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier defines the term- and transculturation, as defined by Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz. I am also interested in developing interdisciplinary approaches in my Latin American Fiction in Translation (ELS250) class. With this assignment, I would like to explore the links between Alejo Carpentier's writing and music, while helping students to appreciate Carpentier's prose, and the links between Baroque aesthetics, transculturation and the concept of Latin American Marvelous Real.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course will introduce students to theatre and performance practices throughout the Americas (U.S. Latinx community, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Hispanophone Caribbean). We will examine how the drama reflects the different histories and cultures of Latin America. Furthermore, we will explore an intercultural dialogue between national dramas to identify connections between the different Americas. The course will delve into topics dealing with politics, history, dictatorship and revolution, imperialism and colonialism, identity (gender, sexual, national, and racial/ethnic, among others), borders, mestizaje, and indigenous performances. Students will acquire a working knowledge of the scholarship and drama of Latin America and the artists' relation to U.S. and European cultural practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>(TSACS) in conjunction with the department of History was awarded a grant to develop humanities subject matter and content – architecture, education, history and philosophy – for a first-ever 18-credit-hour interdisciplinary minor in African American studies with a concentration in the Tuskegee Architects and the History of the Built Environment in the South.  The minor will explore ways of thinking, researching and writing about the diverse experiences of African-Americans and human culture — such endeavors at an HBCU are often more limited in the curricular sense.  The new minor seeks to extend African American history and liberal arts, formally into the architecture curriculum through new humanities offerings – and in so doing, provide a more focused historical perspective for students' current educational and professional trajectories.  The minor will be discipline specific to architecture and seeks to integrate humanities approach into the professional training of architects and builders.  Unlike many historical arguments, this minor goes beyond documenting educational inequities and offers an alternative curriculum that will advance diverse issues and inclusiveness in architecture and humanities education.   The product of the worksop will be the development of three new architecture course syllabi for classes beginning fall 2018.  This minor will serve as a model for other HBCUs with Schools of Architecture and will unveil how to integrate the humanities into other professional disciplines as well as stimulate the revision of existing humanities courses to bridge humanities studies with professional schools.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In "Art Workshops for Children," Herve Tullet maintains that "[c]hildren are masters of creation—they are very intuitive and it is this instinct and their unedited ability to create art that [is inspiring] . . . collective energy and a great group dynamic is a result in itself.  [Teaching art classes] with multiple participants creates an energy that empowers each artist to do new and unexpected things.  When we improvise as a group, we work from a place of freedom, where all mistakes are permissible and there's no such thing" as wrong.  Barbara Rucci makes the case that learning about art develops children's intellectual capacity in all realms: "the value of exposing your children to a world of art runs deep . . . you are helping them strengthen the connection between hemispheres of the brain."  In this class we will read texts on art history and create lesson plans to prepare you to teach children about art, focusing particularly on Indigenous culture.  We will be making art in class together to exercise our own creativity and experience the energy and freedom of art, while learning about Indigenous history and culture.  You will leave this class with a large number of lesson plans, experience in making and teaching art, a strong grasp of art history globally, and increased knowledge in teaching Indigenous art history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course will help you think about three distinct traditions of American Indian writing—those of the Haudenosaunee, Kiowa, and the Columbia Plateau peoples—not as representative of "Native American Literature," but as discrete entities from among the more than six hundred nations indigenous to the land mass we presently call North America. Though such work may unsettle your hopes to draw conclusions about "Native American" thinking and self-expression, I hope it will put you in a stronger position to learn how to learn about an indigenous national literary history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the film American Creed, former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David M. Kennedy come together from remarkably different life experiences, backgrounds and points of view to explore American ideals and identity. Their spirited inquiry frames the stories of a wide range of citizen-activists striving to realize their own visions of America's promise across deep divides.  Just as the film frames the stories of different kinds of activists who wrestle with America's promise, Facing History hopes to inspire young people to engage deeply in a conversation about who we are, and who we want to be.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>These materials, produced in connection with the 2018 exhibition Black Citizenship in the Age of Jim Crow, explore the contested efforts toward full citizenship and racial equality for African Americans that transpired in the fifty years after the Civil War. The period between the end of slavery in 1865 and the end of World War I in 1919 saw African Americans champion their rights as the "separate but equal" age of Jim Crow began. Examining both the activism for and opposition to black citizenship rights, the works of art, political cartoons, photographs, documents, primary accounts, and timelines in this curriculum underscore how ideas of freedom and citizenship were redefined by government and citizen action, and challenged by legal discrimination and violence.  TOPICS: Reconstruction, Jim Crow, citizenship rights, voting rights, segregation, lynching, sharecropping, disenfranchisement, exodusters, racial stereotypes, Lost Cause mythology, Confederate monuments, white supremacy, black activism, the NAACP, the Great Migration, military service  STRUCTURE: three units—Reconstruction, 1865-1877; The Rise of Jim Crow, 1877-1900; and Challenging Jim Crow, 1900-1919</Abstract>

		<Abstract>•In her high school Humanities class, Stephanie Salazar-Amaro used poetry from the Entre Malinche y Guadalupe collection, art from Carmen Lomas Garza, and passages from La Frontera/Borderlands by Gloria Anzaldúa. She did some cross curricular work with the Spanish teacher to help the students understand the Spanish language portions of the passage and was able to guide the students through an analysis of the texts/art pieces.  The students enjoyed looking at familiar scenes, and those who were unfamiliar with the material asked questions.  As a class, they were able to discuss the family traditions in South Texas and how they were portrayed in art. Stephanie intends to use more poetry and passages in her AP Literature class next six weeks</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lesson set uses the Inquiry Design Model (IDM),  a distinctive approach to creating curriculum and instructional materials that honors teachers' knowledge and expertise, avoids overprescription, and focuses on the main elements of the instructional design process as envisioned in the Inquiry Arc of the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for State Social Studies Standards (2013). Unique to the IDM is the blueprint, a one-page representation of the questions, tasks, and sources that define a curricular inquiry.  This lesson asks the compelling question How do people react to rapid technological economic change? and instructs students to write, using specific historical evidence, a response to the following questions: How did American's respond to the rapid changes of the Market Revolution? What changed and what stayed the same?  In addition to the C3 Framework, it uses both AP US Thematic Standards and AP US Content Standards.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>You need to begin by writing an opening paragraph that provides your readers with an overview of what the project is about. [Summer semester 2018 the container was filled with multiple colored peppercorns.] You can be creative here if you want. That means you can imagine and invent a context for the assignment that goes beyond information I have provided; you cannot change or alter the rules of the assignment, however. To begin, you should define any key terms that will be implemented in any your methodologies. After all, readers need to know what it is exactly that you are counting. So, for example, what will count as a red peppercorn? This is what is known as an existential question, i.e., something that addresses the very nature of a thing. All explanations in the assignment must be written in full sentences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A key project for HIST 408W was to conduct biographical research on obscure suffragists from Maryland, and historic newspapers were a major resource for the undergraduate students in this class. Douglas McElrath and Eric Lindquist taught research instruction sessions and performed individual reference sessions for students in the class during the semester. The result was biographical essays for potention inclusion in the online subscription resource "Online Biographical Dictionary of the Woman Suffrage Movement in the United States." The project is coordinated out of SUNY Binghamton, and the online product is distributed by Alexander Street Press: https://chswg.binghamton.edu/WASM-US/crowdsourcing/online biographical dictionary.html</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The PEN Teaching Guides contain materials for the use of instructors to support teaching on human rights, politics, literature, and cultural history. These materials include manuscripts, drafts, clippings, correspondence, official publications, books, posters, video recordings, and additional items from the PEN Digital Collections and related collections held at the Harry Ransom Center. These guides are designed to allow students to engage not only with evolving conversations surrounding human rights and free speech in the twentieth century, but also with landmark events and broad historical trends, from the rise of fascism in the interwar years, through the intensification of the Cold War, and into the era following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the late 1980s and 1990s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>African Americans at Work in Post-WWII Los Angeles: To what extent were African Americans marginal workers needed in times of economic prosperity, and to what extent were they an integral part of the Los Angeles economy, laying the basis for social and political integration?  Teachers and students are provided with (a) historical background information on the employment conditions of African Americans in Los Angeles before, during, and after World War II; (b) a set of photographs with useful information on each time period; and (c) resources for further study.  A suggested lesson activity encourages students to investigate the employment and working conditions of their own parents, then compare those to that of the individuals portrayed in the photographs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the Los Angeles of the 1960s and 1970s, more than 50 years ago, it can be argued that poverty, crime, racism, and racial and ethnic strife were even worse than they are today.  In that context, how was a single African-American man able to get so many people of all different backgrounds to work together?  On the other hand, given that he was a former police officer, why did he experience such a difficult relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department? This lesson recommends a useful introductory exercise in which students are asked to define key terms related to civility, then provides resource information on the availability and authorized documentaries of the work and life of Mayor Tom Bradley, including extensive curricula aligned with the Common Core Standards.  The lesson takes a special look at the difficult relationship between an African-American mayor, who was a former police officer, and the Los Angeles Police Department, during the years that led, and the years that followed, massive civil disturbances in the city.  Photographs and essays support activities that enable teachers and students to look to the future and imagine a city and a society in which fellow citizens are intentionally civil to each other.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In addition to regular in-class work, this course includes experiential or outdoor components built into the class, a series of associated methods assignments, and one, weekend stewardship activitiy. Our outdoor activities and stewardship will offer you the opportunity to engage with different scientific, social scientific, and humanities forms of engagement with the landscapes, ecosystems, and species that characterize southeastern Pennsylvania's Anthropocene "mixed settlements," while providing you the opportunity to match the theory of our readings with the practice of studying these complex places. In short, these are the moments and places where you will have the chance to "ground-truth" our understandings of the Anthropocene. In doing so, we will ask you to engage in original data collection of diverse kinds and interpretive analysis. By the end of the semester, we will ask you to develop your own narrative of what the Anthropocene is and what it means to people living in our region.</Abstract>

Dynamic presentations will illustrate the role and purpose of putting in place a strong data model for bibliographic description, using BIBFRAME and FRBR examples, and the value of implementing standards such as LCSH, LCGFT, and AAT as data authorities. Participants will put these cataloging and metadata concepts directly into practice utilizing tools emerging from the NEH-funded PBCore Development and Training Project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>IPI Digital Print Preservation Educators Materials are a set of instructional tools for previous attendees of IPI's Digital Print Preservation workshops (funded recently by the National Endowment for the Humanities and previously by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation) to review and use to pass on their new knowledge and skills on this important topic to their institutional and local colleagues. Since this content is a summary of those workshops, a basic knowledge of the subject matter from having attended one is mandatory. Included in the set is a PowerPoint presentation and a recommended reading list. The individual subsections (such as inkjet or dye sublimation) can be taught by themselves, in selected groups, in their entirety, or with additional materials provided by the instructor as desired. In addition, this website (dp3project.org) provides significant additional content on this topic as well as illustrations and images that may be of use.  The PowerPoint presentation summarizes the key content such as technologies, materials, sensitivities to damage, care strategies, and naming conventions. There are instructor notes under each slide (if used in presentation mode) that provide recommended commentary; however, these can be modified to serve individual instructor needs. The presentation can also be printed out in a handout layout with three slides per page and accompanying ruled lines for attendee note taking.  The recommended reading list is for the instructor to become more knowledgeable on the topic, as well as for the attendees to further their study in this area. It is in no way and exhaustive list of available references, but these titles can be used to develop a basic reference library on this topic for institutions as well as act as a guide for further inquiry and research on the topic.</Abstract>

Participants will have a choice of seven major threads to follow which connect to what we believe are the most important aspects of Thoreau's thought for young people, and to answer perhaps the most important question of all: Why does Thoreau matter?

		<Abstract>One of the most important lessons I took away from the NEH Lowell workshop is the importance of students "doing history" and learning about the American Industrial Revolution through activities and tours of the sites where history happened. My aim while creating the following lessons was to achieve the mission of the Tsongas Industrial History Center by inspiring, "...connections with and understandings about America's industrial past, present, and future through experiential learning using Lowell's unique resources." The following lessons include opportunities for students to complete primary and secondary source based activities in which Lowell's history is used as a case study to explore the causes and consequences of the American Industrial Revolution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Throughout my participation in "The Lowell Experience" workshop, I have not only increased my background knowledge of Lowell's impact on the Industrial Revolution, but I have gained access to valuable resources I can use in my teaching practice. My fifth graders often have a difficult time imagining what life would have been like throughout periods of history and they learn best through visuals and role-play. Therefore, when developing my lessons following the workshop, I wanted to focus on allowing students to explore the Industrial Revolution through hands-on activities, research-based lessons, and creative experiences. I'd also love to take my students on a field trip to the Tsongas Industrial History Center and encourage colleagues at my school to do the same.  In the following lessons, you'll find more information on the context of the lessons as well as lesson objectives and essential questions. I plan to share these lessons and resources with my colleagues to help all fifth grade students in my school gain a deeper understanding of the Industrial Revolution as it pertains to Lowell, our town's neighboring city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Trauma Studies Minor, a track that stems from the proposed Medical Humanities Minor, housed in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.  CHASS faculty is uniquely positioned to understand and lead transformative work in the rapidly growing area of trauma studies. Currently existing programs in trauma studies world-wide focus exclusively on psychological and psychiatric approaches.  The multi-disciplinary, intersectional approach to Trauma Studies that has emerged from the grant work at UIW will be unique in that it leverages the scholarship and deep expertise across several disciplines to work together to share knowledge, develop innovative ways to address trauma, and to share these findings with our local community as well as with academic communities within and outside of UIW.  In essence, the trauma track of this minor allows students to develop a broad and nuanced understanding of traumatic experience and, more importantly, apply that knowledge in their careers and daily lives.  The trauma track also requires that students complete some of their service hours at an organization that aids traumatized populations (such as combat veterans, immigrants, and victims of sexual or domestic violence).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The relationship between art and political action is a topic of heated debate. Likewise, the question of the use of art—or its supposed uselessness—is a matter of continued controversy. In this graduate-level course, we ask how art might be said to act directly upon the world. How have critical art practices tested the categorically self-contained boundaries of art by asking challenging questions about art's purpose in the world, its separation from everyday life, its anti-instrumentality, or its ability to intervene in the politics of representation? The task of this course is two-fold: to both map some key post-war interventionist art practices and to query the conceptual parameters of what constitutes a "critically engaged" art practice. Throughout this course, we will examine a series of aesthetic strategies that have placed art at the center of political interventionism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The places we inhabit everyday are mostly invisible for the majority of people. Unless we provide an opportunity to observe and analyze them—our surroundings are generally taken for granted much like breathing air. Most people do not realize that our surroundings and how they are designed can affect our daily functions and behavior—   often unconsciously, and that good design can contribute in a positive way to our feelings and healing because the ultimate goal of spatial design is the embodiment of human experience. In this course, we will start with phenomenology of architecture, and then we will apply these concepts to spatial designs for care, healing, and well-being. The course consists of five critical themes: 1) Design Philosophy; 2) Neuroscience and Architecture; 3) Places for Healing in a Global Context; 4) Places for Well-being in a Local Context; and 5) Design Thinking - Design Processes for Improving our Surroundings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Medical institutions rely heavily on lists in order to communicate with and about patients (Browning, 1992), yet Arthur Frank (1995) says that patients find their way through illness by telling their stories. In order to improve understanding about patients' perspectives of health and illness, their stories must be reclaimed from the diagnostic lists and treatments that dominate patient identities. As medical schools begin to select students based not only on their scientific acumen but also their understanding of the humanities, they are recognizing what Rita Charon (2008) states: Along with their growing scientific expertise, doctors need the expertise to listen to their patients, to understand as best they can the ordeals of illness, to honor the meanings of their patients' narratives of illness, and to be moved by what they behold so that they can act on their patients' behalf (p. 3). In addition to aiding in their treatment of patients, narrative medicine offers a means for medical practitioners to reflect on difficult cases by exploring their emotions and personal challenges in a career that is marked by significant stress (Roscoe, 2012). Students will read illness narratives and the theoretical background of narrative medicine, develop their own personal narratives of health and illness, and work with others to narrativize their illness experiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ranging from classical philosophy to the digital age, the course invites students to explore the different ways in which knowledge is created and consumed, how understanding is cultivated, the various relationships possible between knowledge and the self, and the implications of these in our contemporary world. Through an examination of common topics, independent research, studio experiences, and assignments, this course will explore the meaning and value of interdisciplinary inquiry for the cultivation of practical wisdom in our personal and civic lives.Unlike our typical AOK classes, this class focuses on a specific theme, Medical Humanities (MH).  DSS 1-MHGC:Why Study Medical Humanities? DSS 2-MHGC:Introducing Medical Humanities: History &amp;amp; Concept DSS 3-MHGC:Exploring Philosophical Approaches DSS 4-MHGC:Eudaimonia: Human Well-being beyond the Absence of Illness DSS 5-MHGC:Theory &amp;amp; Practice: Making Art Accessible to People DSS 6-MHGC:Theory &amp;amp; Practice: Observing &amp;amp; Making Sense DSS 7-MHGC:Problem Solving: Architecture &amp;amp; Design DSS 8-MHGC:Existential Case Study: Judgment &amp;amp; Context DSS 9-MHGC:Existential Case Study: Stories DSS 10-MHGC:Conclusion: Medical Humanities in a Global Context Medical Humanities (DSS) sessions will include  specific cases and stories along with additional resources for your reference. Therefore, the course-preparation materials for Medical Humanities are  multi-faceted, which is intended to help you explore different types of, ideas about, and approaches to Medical Humanities within a limited timeframe. Ultimately, you should be able to provide your own answer to the question "What are Medical Humanities?" and at the end of the semester you might discover areas within the field of Medical Humanities you would be interested in when considering your Medical Humanities pathway at the Honors College.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper assignment integrates one of the labs from the Scientific Revolution unit (Galileo's Inclined Plane Experiment) with lecture and discussion of the changing cultural styles and values in experimentation during the 16th and 17th centuries. First, students reproduce the inclined plane experiment under historical conditions that Galileo would have faced. Then they write up the lab report in three styles: (1) based on Galileo's model from his "Two Chief World Systems" (1632); (2) based on an experimental report that Robert Boyle published in his "Philosophical Transactions" in 1667; and (3) in the style of a standard present-day physical lab report. Finally students reflect on what changing conventions and formats of lab report can tell us about the cultural history of experimentation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The topic of this seminar is truth in the sense formulated by Tarski, that is, as a semantic notion (if one doesn't like the idea of truth being a semantic notion, one could think of it as the notion of ‘expressing a truth'). As is well known, there are problems, generated by various paradoxes, the most famous being the Liar. We will discuss, among other things, Tarski's original approach and how it might be extended. The relevance of Gödel's work, and alternative ways of looking at the (first) Gödel incompleteness theorem. And, of course, my own work in this area, which in addition to a treatment of truth, mentions some other ways of looking at the Gödel incompleteness theorem. I also hope to discuss the relevance of various fixed points and alternative valuation schemes. In addition, the view, advocated by Yablo and others, that Truth Tellers ought to be definitely false, not indeterminate, and how this might be developed in my own approach. If time permits, we may discuss later developments, alternatives or extensions of my own work (such as the revision theory of truth, Hartry Field's approach, our own Graham Priest's dialetheist treatment, etc.)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between the 1930s and the 1970s there was a general consensus amongst logicians that the best solution to the Liar and related paradoxes was Tarskian: no language can be allowed to contain its own truth predicate. In the 1970s this consensus disappeared, and it is now more generally held that an appropriate solution should accommodate a language with its own truth predicate. How that should be done is, of course, another matter.  In this course, we will be reading and discussing a number of papers that deal with that issue from a variety of different perspectives. Topics to be discussed include (hopefully): classical vs non-classical logic, definitions of truth vs axiomatic theories, fixed point constructions, dialetheism, conditionals and restricted quantification, revenge paradoxes, sub-structural solutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This class will consist in my own introductory approach to recursion (computability) theory. Some of its basic results, though very easily recognized as true by experts, are not usually given as foundational in textbooks. My approach tries to tie recursion theory to basic ideas in formal logic.  Topics to be covered include: the intuitive concept of computability and its formal counterparts, the status of Church's Thesis, my RE language, the basic ‘generated sets theorem' and the ‘upwards generated sets theorem', the enumeration theorem, the road from the inconsistency of the unrestricted comprehension principle to the Gödel – Tarski theorems, the narrow and broad languages of arithmetic, Cantor's diagonal principle, different versions of Gödel's Theorem, an enumeration theorem for partial recursive functions, languages with a recursively enumerable but non-recursive set of formulae, the uniform effective form of Gödel's theorem, the second incompleteness theorem, the self-reference lemma, the Tarski-Mostowski-Robinson theorem, the enumeration operator fixed-point theorem, the first and second recursion theorems, and the jump operator.  If time permits, we may be able to cover the arithmetical hierarchy and the jump hierarchy, the ?-rule, hyperarithmetical and ? 1^1 sets, Borel sets, ? 1^1 sets, normal form theorems, the Baire category theorem, incomparable degrees, and related topics.  Requirements: a solid background in first order logic and a degree of mathematical sophistication will be presupposed.</Abstract>

The course sequence offers a study of Islam and Muslims within a framework of global religious traditions and emphasis on profound diversity of localized belief and practice found across the world. Students exam Islam's evolution across 15 centuries, from late antiquity--when it emerged as localized religion in Central Arabia--to modern era where it is practice from US to Indonesia. The sequence concentrates on broad analytical categories in the study of religion such as text, culture, history, and prophecy.

		<Abstract>You can learn a lot about a time period from newspapers published at that time – anxieties, sources of entertainment, local and national events and more. A variety of publishers produced newspapers, each with their own point of view. This activity focuses on articles from newspapers published by labor unions during World War II in the 1940s. Learning objectives include: (1) students will learn to analyze newspaper articles to understand the past, evaluate different perspectives and make decisions; and (2) students will work together with their peers to make decisions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Newspapers are often a key part of historical research. In the mid-1800s, World's Fairs (also known as World Expositions) were a way for nations around the world to communicate their recent advancements. Newspapers captured who was there, what was displayed, and how it was received by the world. In this activity, students will examine newspaper clippings from the Dayton Forum, an African-American newspaper, to explore the first African-American exhibit held at a World's Fair in the United States. They will consider what role they had in creating the exhibit, what their intentions were, and what their participation at the World's Fair can tell us about American race relations on the eve of World War II. This lesson plan may also serve as a jumping off point for National History Day and the 2021 contest theme of Communication in History: The Key to Understanding.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Airtable is an online relational database application that operates somewhere between Excel, Google Sheets, FileMaker, and OpenRefine. With a high ease of usability and very low barrier of entry, Airtable is a good solution for robust metadata management and data curation for archivists without the resources or skill sets to implement more costly or complicated full-stack solutions. A solid alternative to the many cloud-based project management software options, Airtable is also a great choice for cultural heritage organizations or regional archives operating remotely with a disbursed labor force.  This online workshop will build upon the workshop "Airtable for A/V Archivists" given by Stephanie Sapienza and Ed Summers at last year's AMIA Conference. This webinar may be useful to you if you are looking to build a new tool into your toolkit to do things like: unify your legacy data sets (from Excel, Google Sheets, MS Access, FileMaker, etc.) into one space; streamline workflows for authority control, metadata refinement and normalization; or project manage digitization, collection management, or other archival/preservation projects.  Presenters will give an overview of Airtable basics such as tables, fields, and views, and show how this tool can be leveraged to manage different kinds of metadata and projects; create controlled vocabularies and authority lists; de-duplicate and normalize records; share data with others both within and outside your organization; data import and export. The workshop will also introduce more advanced features of Airtable, such as Airtable blocks, using the Airtable API to facilitate batch functions, and use of Airtable as a CMS backend for websites.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course highlights the vital role of moral philosophy in exploring deep ethical questions in criminal justice. What is the right thing to do? And what are the elements of good character? In the spirit of applied philosophy, the course will engage these types of questions while also introducing significant connections to important criminal justice issues. Topics include logic and critical thinking concepts that are central to the philosophical method as well as ethical theories that can ground the composition and evaluation of a wide range of ethical arguments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In conjunction with my research project, Teaching Business and Labor History to Art and Design Students under progress from 2018 to 2021, I would like all of you to consider the intersection of art, spectacle, and labor as a theme of Art in New York in the spring of 2019. Art and labor became more prominent in the nineteenth century as rural society rapidly transformed into urban culture. Scenes of rural laborers such as farmers, fishermen, or workers were often received as nostalgic views of by-gone eras. Artists such as Impressionists in nineteenth-century Paris discovered images of urban workers such as shop keepers, street vendors, or railroad workers. At the same time, the genre of spectacle was being invented in industrial machines, steel and glass buildings, or newly renovated urban boulevards. In this class, we will visit a diverse range of special exhibitions held in New York City or elsewhere and think about how art (or artists) is intertwined with the creation of spectacles or spectacular new experiences at the expense of hard labor, visible or invisible.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course explores the intersection of art and labor from the perspective of how the production of visual arts has evolved with economic development and business management. Students learn about critical issues that surround the making of art and the status of artists and designers in the context of modern and contemporary labor and business. The course enables students to understand that historical events or philosophical ideologies impact the livelihood of artists and designers. Students also learn about effects of political upheaval, war, migration, and exile on works and career choices of artists and designers. Changes to the terms of employment and labor conditions have resulted from incidents including, but not limited to, looms driven by steam; the invention of readymade paint in tubes; contemporary issues of copyright and originality; the mining labor behind the use of precious materials in art; and the exposure to poisons and pollution in the manufacture of certain luxury products. Topics and case studies are open to thematic and theoretical approaches as new modes of employment emerge in the present time. Historical precedents of the collaborative aspects of art, architecture, design, or crafts, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations with creators and practitioners outside visual arts are also introduced within the course's own framework of art and labor.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Reading city directories and census pages at the beginning of a semester, students will take a real person who worked at the occupation they are studying and build a character based on those records and other primary and secondary sources we provide.  In class, or off-line, the student will play this character as she or he faces crises and conundrums of the eras. When the record is silent on these specific people (their values, aspects of their identity, the kind of firm they work for, etc.), students will fill in the blanks with their imagination, guided by readings about the era. This will become an avatar or virtual character for the student. Students can be allowed to play their ancestors. Some faculty may want to impose balances of class, race, gender, occupation, etc. Very few students should be allowed to play famous people.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>By shadowing a professional or interviewing a recent retiree of a specific field of industry, students can develop a sense of community as well as learn about realities of working-class employees in New York City. Instructors can create an assignment pertinent to this and provide a historical context.  Many students are already working or participating in internships in their chosen professional training. Historicizing their industry or positions with someone's life experience and personal stories will enable students to perceive their career path with more dignity and socio-economic contexts.</Abstract>

We look at fictional representations in cinema such as Matewan (Sayles, 1987), Do The Right Thing (Lee, 1980), and The Green Book (Farrelly, 2018) while contextualizing them in the historical background of immigration, segregation, and integration as they pertain to these two groups. Students will then create theatrical projects in which they imagine different modes of interaction based on racial and ethnic identity in a variety of different workplace contexts.</Abstract>

Are hotel workers and especially management figures portrayed as servile or confident? How much of the actual workflow is depicted, and if it is not realistic, how might it warp viewers' experiences in real hotels? After reviewing selections of popular art provided by the professors, students will find their own clips to show and comment on to the class.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Film and television clips: The Shop Around the Corner (Ernst Lubitsch, 1940); Le amiche/The Girlfriends (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1955); Hester Street (Joan Micklin Silver, 1975); Nine to Five (Colin Higgins, 1980); El tiempo entre costuras/The Time in Between (TV series, 2013-2014) Clips will focus on issues of gender in the workplace, with attention to general issues pertaining to both retail and corporate environments, and specific case studies of the fashion industry. Some sample activities the students may participate in: a) identify the career trajectory of the male versus female protagonists in their sales positions. What do you expect will happens in terms of job security, opportunities for promotion, wage increases, co-worker and customer relations? b) using the fashions created by the designers in the films/TV series, create two separate business models,:  one that you would believe would be successful in the time period in which the show/film is based, and one for today. Present these business strategies to the class. What are the similarities/differences between these models and how are they influenced by historical, economic, and cultural factors? c) list the innovations the female protagonists introduce in their office. In small groups, create a proposal for further changes that specifically address the issues raised in the film. How do they address issues of sexual harassment, gender parity, work-family balance, flexibility, and overall improvement to the physical work environment? Pay special attention to issues such as race, class, and physical disability.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this activity, students will be introduced to the topic of the Atomic Age. During the period from 1945-1962, people all across the United States debated the topic of atomic energy and weapons. Many people supported their use, while others questioned their efficacy. Much of this debate played out in newspaper columns and editorial letters. In this Document Based Question activity, students will read excerpts from newspaper articles printed during this time period. Students will analyze these excerpts and use them as evidence in a final essay that argues for or against the use of atomic energy and/or weapons.</Abstract>

In particular, women as textile makers/weavers and formation of guilds in the Middle Ages in promoting particular quality control on fabrics.  My lesson plans include (since our NEH sessions) the history of the cotton textile industry that fuels industrial revolution.  The slavery of South that provided fiber to English factories and labor conditions of the new manufactuers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This course explores books and documents before print, exploring them as material objects within their historical and social contexts. We will ask questions about who made books and other documents, how they were designed, who used them, and how they were used. These lines of inquiry (producer, design, user, and function) are closely intertwined: understanding the purpose of a book or document can help us decode its design and even the words on a page – and vice versa. This course will cover all aspects of manuscript production, dissemination, readership and reception, and ownership. The focus will be on Latinate manuscripts of Western Europe, but we will give you the tools to approach manuscripts across a range of cultures and languages.  While exploring the context of medieval manuscripts, the course will provide a practical grounding in the terms and practices of manuscript description and transcription, covering paleography (the history of scripts), codicology (the study of the material and physical history of the book), decoration, and diplomatics (the study of official documents).</Abstract>
