1023,FB-51501-05,"At the National Folklore Festival held in Cosquín, Argentina, the relationship of tradition, modernity, and identity so present in Latin America is manifested through music:  a conflict exists regarding what ""musical folklore"" is and thus which genres, styles, and musical instruments to permit.  Some involved think that ""authentic"" folklore is only the most traditional type, but others believe it includes modernized folk/popular music.  By means of this aesthetic controversy, Argentine identity is negotiated.  Cosquín Festival organizers want to preserve ""authentic"" national culture yet at the same time permit originality of creation in folk/popular music and dance amidst globalization and the arrival of other musics, ideologies, and technologies.  The Pre-Cosquín Competition for new talent, held the two weeks prior to the Festival proper each year, carries out this objective:  2500 semifinalists from over 50 regional centers compete to earn the right to perform at the Festival and be named the Festival's ""Revelation.""  In this paper, I explain what is being done to negotiate the confrontation of musical values in the Pre-Cosquín Competition process.  Data are based on fieldwork done with Festival organizers, Pre-Cosquín jury members (criteria used), participants, and the experience of having served as a Pre-Cosquín Festival inspector. ",Jane L.

Trace the stories of three persons—a young Frenchman, an Indian woman and a Spanish woman captured by Comanches--to illustrate how sweeping changes were transforming the West, and in particular the Great Plains, including what is now Oklahoma, for a century and a quarter before Lewis and Clark set off up the Missouri River. &#x0D; &#x0D; After his lecture, Professor West answered questions from the audience about Lewis and Clark and the historical characters he focused on, the Frenchman, the Indian woman, the Spanish woman, and the Comanche tribe. &#x0D; &#x0D; The goal of the project was to share Professor West's expertise of Great Plains and Western history and his storytelling skills with a local public audience.",Oklahoma Council for History Education,9/23/11,"Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, Norman, Oklahoma",,,,,Frontiers in History

2281,FN-50065-10,"The trajectory of language shift in the West Zapotec region of Oaxaca, Mexico is apparent from the dialect geography: of eleven town centers where Zapotec was spoken, only four remain where some children are raised in Zapotec. Against this backdrop of language shift this talk examines contrasting styles of conversation used in child language socialization in Santa María Lachixío. For many decades Lachixío has been characterized by a functionally differentiated bilingualism in which Zapotec was used in all domains of social life outside of public schooling and public health. In the fourteen years that I have been conducting fieldwork there, a mosaic has developed where some families are now code-shifting to Spanish in their child-directed speech. Using transcribed videotaped data I contrast two families' conversation styles involving same-aged children. I discuss a Zapotec-language speech event in which a family socializes a boy to the Zapotec respect register and contrast videos of another family code-shifting to Spanish when addressing their children. I then turn to analyzing an interaction where these two families intersect and the code-shifting style of socialization became topicalized. Through analysis of the sequence organization of the dialogue I argue that the new socialization style is contested, and discuss several linguistic and interactional devices for constructing irony and ""off-record"" disagreement. Moving beyond the transcripts, I draw on my ethnographic work to argue that the positions taken up by the participants of this dialogue voice prior conversations between parents and school teachers who suggested that parents stop using Zapotec. Previously, parents organized a unified resistance that partly explains Lachixío's language enduring to the present day. The new socialization style exemplified through the multimodal data presented in this talk represents a contemporary social change being enacted (and contested) through talk in interaction.",Mark A.

2283,FN-50065-10,"The sound qualities of a speaker's voice animate speech and shape social interactions.  Yet, studies of sound quality have not been well developed in anthropology and linguistics.  This is in part because the voice is generally thought to be biologically given, directly related to things like body size or sex of the speaker.  This talk presents research that considers qualities of human voices as cultural constructions and contextualizes the study of voice qualities within social theory.  I present functions of voice qualities from social interactions between speakers of Lachixío Zapotec, an Otomanguean language spoken in the southern mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico.  The interactions demonstrate the use of high pitched and falsetto voices, which I argue index a respect register that presupposes social categories present to a speech event: ritual kin relationships; age grades; and distinguishing among territorial roles like visitor vs. visited.  These multiple person categories show that respect in Lachixío is not binary but hierarchical.  Some uses of high pitch are merely polite, while others are part of a formal honorific system tied to kinship roles.  Where the speech scene involves multiple addressees representing different levels of the social hierarchy, speakers can show varying degrees of respect such that where high pitch displays respect, higher pitch shows more respect, and falsetto voice is the most respectful.  Pitch is varied with addressee choice and such pitch variation uses the voice to create a publicly available diagram of the unequal social relations present to a speech situation.  In the last section of the talk I investigate the question of how children are socialized to this complex system for voicing social relations in Lachixío and point to potentials for further research on voice qualities in linguistic anthropology.",Mark A.

Yet all three aesthetic traditions came under sustained attack in the colonial modern period for their supposed formalism, decadence, hidebound obeisance to tradition, and above all their eroticism and sensuality. Producers and supporters of all three art forms employed surprisingly similar transformative strategies to meet the challenges that modernity and bourgeois nationalism posed to the survival of these important North Indian traditions. In the process, however, important early-modern links among the three traditions, which followed from a rich and virtuosic aesthetic of intermedial and multilingual borrowing, were covered over and largely forgotten. In this conversation, three international scholars of these traditions, whose work traverses the early-modern and colonial periods, will discuss what happened to the entangled histories and aesthetics of these arts as they transitioned into the modern world.","Katherine Butler Schofield, Molly Emma Aitken, Allison Busch",10/23/2014,"King's College, London","http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/worldwide/initiatives/global/indiainstitute/Events/eventsrecords/Modernitys-challenge-to-Indias-aesthetic-traditions-Rajput-painting,-Hindi-poetry-and-Hindustani-music.aspx",Link to the events page for King's College London,,,"""Modernity's Challenge to India's Aesthetic Traditions"""

3551,FT-62126-14,"The 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the codification in paintings of ideal Indic heroines called nayikas, some of whom were based on earlier sculptural prototypes.  Defined in the visual arts by their conventional poses and motifs, these nayikas entered into a wide range of pictorial contexts, including illustrations of poetic and devotional texts and the pages of Mughal albums, called muraqqa, which combined painting with beautifully calligraphed texts. The Indic nayika joined European, Persian, and Mughal female ideals in a richly varied repertoire of types, which painters would continue to draw on well into the 19th and 20th centuries. Related to this phenomenon was a growing profusion of portraits that pictured elite Mughal and Rajput men with beautiful women, some of them types and some possibly representing wives or mistresses. Focusing on the Indic nayika, this paper examines her aesthetic and social significance in the early years of her codification, especially in relation to the broader proliferation of pictures of female beauties. Particular attention is given to the production and reception of nayika imagery in domains of elite social pleasure, where she would have been surrounded with poetry, music, dance, food and drink, friendship, and love. The paper builds on recent scholarship that understands the Mughal and Rajput worlds to have been mutually constitutive, and on a growing dialogue between South Asian art history and cultural studies, while addressing the need for more sustained theorization of the central place of gender in the visual arts of the Mughal era.",Molly Emma Aitken,4/7/2015,Emory University,,,,,Love Beyond Reach: Mughal Paintings of Indian Heroines

4131,HR-50517-10,"I want to make three points in particular. The first is that we really have to study urban revitalization from the bottom up to see how and why it has worked. My second point is that we therefore need to rethink the rather top-down way that we often imagine how and why things work in our global system of cities. This includes trying to decenter the United States and thus seeing revitalization in a hemispheric context in which migrants' motivations, efforts, and actions have been conditioned by decisionmaking by governments, a considerable amount of it by foreign governments; and in which revitalization has both depended upon and influenced urban areas far from the cities of the United States. My third point involves both the realm of theory and the realm of policy: at the theoretical level, this means taking a different approach than that indicated by the global cities paradigm; at the level of policy, it means not tailoring municipal initiaties to the ""creative class,"" yuppies, or hipsters, but to immigrants and migrants—and in particular, immigrants of all classes, not just the much discussed and sought-after globetrotting techno-wizards.",A.

4133,HR-50517-10,"What I would like to do today is to address the theme of ""Immigration and Metropolitan Revitalization"" by suggesting that we should understand it as a case of transnationalism from below—and that if we do, we can both see the entire phenomenon more clearly and also foster the kinds of policies most likely to expand existing examples of revitalization. I'm going to talk about this in three parts, one at each of three geographic levels, in order to offer a sort of nested account of the big picture. I am going to argue that metropolitan revitalization has been part of the formation of a broader urban system, one that is transnational—but that doesn't simply follow the dictates of ""big capital""; rather, it is created by migrants and immigrants with particular features of its own that are best understood at the local, grassroots level.",A.

4135,HR-50517-10,"Momentous demographic shifts have yet to be incorporated into existing paradigms of urban history, in part because the field is still bounded by the nation-state. The postwar historiography has remained resolutely domestic even as other areas of U.S. history have been challenged and in some cases transformed by the transnational turn in historical writing.  Moreover, in related fields like urban sociology, geography, and anthropology, much influential research has analyzed cities according to their role in globalization.  After forty years in which some of the most important demographic and economic forces acting on cities have operated across borders, urban historians need to reconsider some of the basic assumptions and explanatory frameworks in the field.

The two-week occupation of City College in Harlem precipitated a political crisis in the city and ushered in a major shift in public policy; as a result, it received extensive local and national media attention, but strikingly, it has garnered little attention from historians. The black student movement in New York City won reforms that transformed public higher education and paved the way for the expansion of the black middle class in the New York City region.

4747,RA-50103-11,"Many gods and goddesses known in the rich pantheon of Indic religious traditions throughout history have their origins at local level practices that reflect worldly needs of devotees.  Addressing one of the most pressing human concerns of life and death, a goddess or a god with ability to cure the sick enjoyed immense trans-regional popularity. Yet, a claim for a specialty against a specific disease is surprisingly rare. In this context, Parn?as´abari¯, a Buddhist goddess of healing with a claimed specialty against smallpox, and her association with Hindu smallpox goddess S´i¯tala¯, provide an interesting case to understand the changing landscape of healing and medicine in medieval South Asia not only because their appearance helps us discern the historical rise of smallpox epidemics in India but also because their iconographies points to the incorporation of the ritual practices of tantric and periphery traditions into much wider use. By closely examining the iconographies of these goddesses as represented in surviving images and ritual texts from the ninth through the twelfth centuries, Jinah Kim suggest that the pattern of iconographic appropriation and adaptation seen in the development of instrumental iconography of healing demonstrates how the interactions between local medico-cultic practices and normative religious institutions informed trans-local understanding of an epidemic disease, which in turn must have contributed to the development of medical discourse and spread of healing strategies in pre-modern South Asia.",Jinah Kim,4/16/2015,"Harvard University, Hindu Studies Colloquium  ","http://sas.fas.harvard.edu/event/hindu-studies-colloquium-jinah-kim ","Link to the Harvard University, Hindu Studies Colloquium, program and presentation abstracts.",,,"Pockmarked Demons, Pot-bellied Goddesses: Images of Sickness and Healing and Trans-Sectarian Development of Medico-Cultic Practices in Pre-Modern South Asia"
4748,RA-50103-11,"The early history of the art of the book in India owes much to the Buddhist practice of commissioning beautifully crafted books for religious merits. Once the idea of embellishing and illustrating text folios with paintings was introduced at the turn of the first millennium, initially in Buddhist context, makers and patrons of painted manuscripts experimented with various design strategies and codicological features, most of which emphasized a manuscript's material quality as a three-dimensional, portable sacred object. By the mid-twelfth century, some Buddhist manuscript makers in eastern India and Nepal began to materialize the concept of a manuscript as a temple in a visually engaging manner. Jinah Kim demonstrate that her analogy of a book as a temple was a consciously chosen design strategy and locate this artistic practice in the larger historical context by drawing comparisons with the design strategies of manuscripts of other Indic religious traditions as well as those seen in temple architecture. Kim also take its ramifications beyond the artistic practice and consider it to be the theoretical framework behind the practice of painted manuscript making in medieval India.",Jinah Kim,2/27/2015,"University of Chicago, Divinity School and the Franke Institute for the Humanities",https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/imce/conferences/merits/conference%20abstracts.pdf,"Link to program and presentation abstracts for the conference ""Merits of the Book: Buddhist Manuscript Traditions Across Asia.""",,,Sacred Space of a Manuscript: Design Strategies and Codicological Features in Medieval Indic Manuscripts

Given this exclusivity, a manuscript experience may be placed at the opposite end of experiential spectrum to the experience of a printed book. Yet, in the case of pre-modern South Asia, where a long history of the supremacy of oral transmission of knowledge prevailed, a manuscript experience was often public. A carefully designed and executed manuscript was often made to serve an important ceremonial role as a ritual object conveying the text, which was performed orally and consumed aurally and visually.

More recently, oral history historians have played a fundamental interpretive role in transforming our understanding of history of civil rights activism by discovering the complex interactions between local activists and the national movement.  Oral histories have allowed scholars to draw upon the stories of hundreds of civil rights activists, and thus shift the focus of our understanding of how the movement developed and functioned away from a focus on national leaders and their organizations to the community leaders and local activists whose organizing gave the movement its energy and direction. &#x0D; &#x0D; Since its founding in 1971, USM's Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage has been preserving the stories of those who organized, protested, and fought for civil rights in Mississippi and across the nation.

Machine readers, however, are woefully unsuited to the uneven inking, anachronistic characters, unfamiliar typefaces, inconsistent orthographies, and multilinguality that characterize these historical documents.

The project focuses on the tailoring the tool for reading the Primeros Libros collection of books printed in the Americas during the first century of Spanish colonization.&#x0D; &#x0D; This talk will introduce the practical and theoretical implications of this project for both librarians and scholars interested in colonial documents or cultural analytics.

However, this possibility will be realized only if tools and infrastructure to explore and analyze textual data can rise to the challenge posed by the data's scale and access restrictions.

The project is a multi-period mound site that accumulated from the remains of human settlement spanning thousands of years. Thirteen meters high, the mound was occupied from at least the early Bronze Age, circa 3000 B.C., through the late Byzantine period, circa 1200 A.D. &#x0D; The excavations have focused on the Byzantine levels on the top and center of the mound, with several buildings—including a church complete with mosaics and inscriptions. On the slopes that have eroded over the years, the team has excavated early Bronze Age levels. There they have uncovered a number of houses, some of which were burned, preserving the architecture.  Because the architecture is unbaked mud, when it burns it becomes fired into a hard substance like brick, preserving the impressions of the wood, reed, and plant materials used inside the structure of the wall.  The architectural evidence allows researchers to understand how the buildings were constructed, what they were like, and what they were used for. The burnt buildings also conserve intact or broken pottery  and other finds that can be put back together and studied.  On the house floors, the excavation team has found things that were in the room at the time of the fire—things that have to do with weaving, cooking, stone tools or objects. &#x0D; ",Elizabeth Baughan,01/20/2016,"Turkish Embassy, Washington DC"," http://www.americanfriendsofturkey.org/calendar/","Event as presented by the American Friends of Turkey, one of the sponsors of the lecture series together with the American Turkish Council and the Institute of Turkish Studies.

5335,RA-50127-13,"The matter of Troy in the medieval Latin West sustains a vision of the&#x0D; city of Troy as ever present yet always already destroyed: a city that&#x0D; exists outside of time. In medieval historiography, the Fall of Troy&#x0D; results in the Trojan diaspora and the settlement of Europe by Trojan&#x0D; refugees who flee the burning city; the fall of Troy consequently makes&#x0D; the narrative of European history possible. This vision of Trojan&#x0D; ancestry as a myth of origins is often invoked to express a vision of&#x0D; European futurity. This paper will explore how the /translatio /of the&#x0D; matter of Troy generated its own temporality.&#x0D; &#x0D; In the absence of the Homeric epics, the matter of Troy was transmitted&#x0D; to the medieval West by the Latin prose texts attributed to Dares and&#x0D; Dictys. These texts represent themselves as the /translatio /of ancient&#x0D; Greek textual traditions and simultaneously as the material transmission&#x0D; of these traditions from papyrus to parchment. The vernacular itinerary&#x0D; of the Latin texts of Dares and Dictys create a distinct Trojan&#x0D; temporality. In the twelfth-century /Roman de Troie/, Benoît de&#x0D; Sainte-Maure insists that the materiality of translation practices&#x0D; allows the reader to participate directly in the Trojan War, while two&#x0D; centuries later, the visual program in a manuscript of Raoul de Presles'&#x0D; translation of Augustine's /De Civitate Dei/ encapsulates the&#x0D; atemporality of Troy as transmitted by Dares.",Marilynn Desmond,01/21/2016,"University of Cambridge, UK",http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/research/medieval/?p=709,University website,,,Trojan Temporality and the Materiality of Literary History

We consider the many challenges Dante faced in composing Paradise, and specifically how to maintain the narrative of the pilgrim's physical journey through the heavenly spheres and how to invent a language and a set of images that would convey the extraordinary and ineffable experience of Paradise concluding with the beatific vision of the Triune God.

Not only did Bronson Alcott and Henry Thoreau compliment her ""wit and genius,"" but Henry Thoreau also called Emerson at age eighty-one ""the youngest person in Concord."" Mary Emerson's most significant writings are a series of unpublished manuscript journals, which she kept for over half a century.

10193,FA-54864-09,"n Tunisia, trance rituals animated by praise songs to Sufi saints are not exclusive to members of Sufi orders or participants in Sufi ceremonies. Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, namely, those of women, the Jewish community, Tunisians of sub-Saharan descent, and hard-drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical ""journey"" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community. Since the rise of Islamism after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, these communities have come under serious threat and musicians, participants, and performance sites have been threatened and attacked. This paper, then, also discusses how this project has become an example of ""ethnomusicology in times of trouble"" (Rice 2014).",Richard Jankowsky,04/15/2016,"University of California, Berkeley",,,,,Ambient Sufism (in Times of Trouble)

10362,RZ-51107-09,"Recent research on the northern frontier of the Inca Empire is beginning to bring to light important new information pertaining to the affairs of the imperial state in the final decades of its existence. The region to the north of Quito associated with the ethnic Caranqui population was the last to be effectively annexed by the Inca prior to the Spanish invasion. The highly militarized landscape of this region speaks to the intensity and the duration of the final Inca wars of conquest. How did this ultimate chapter of Inca history unfold, what strategies did the Cuzqueños deploy to subdue and manage such distant lands, and what role did this region and its people play in the final dramas of the imperial state? These are fascinating questions that are currently being addressed with new archaeological and ethnohistoric data from the northern highlands of Ecuador. In this talk, I present the results of recent archaeological investigations at the northernmost imperial center of Inca-Caranqui. Based on the evidence, we believe this site to have been originally constructed by Huayna Capac to commemorate his hard-won victory over the recalcitrant Caranqui, and subsequently appropriated and re-modeled by Atahualpa to serve as the intended site of his royal panaqa. The archaeological data also suggest the ways in which material strategies of imperial rule evolved over time and as a function of distance from the Inca heartland.","Bray, Tamara",12/10/11,"Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC",,,,,"At the End of Empire: The Inca, the Caranqui, and the Northern Imperial Frontier"

10478,FA-55993-11,"My presentation shows how the spectacular celebration of Dante's six-hundredth birthday on May14-16, 1865 in Florence, the new capital of Italy, doubled not only as a love-fest toasting the young nation's independence but also as a rallying cry to complete unification with the additions of Venice (1866) and Rome (1870). Over three days and nights a tightly choreographed variety of events—from the procession of representatives from cities and towns all over Italy and the unveiling of Enrico Pazzi's colossal Dante statue to musical performances, dances, horse races, banquets, and exhibits—exploited Dante's authority as Mazzini's ""Profeta della nazione italiana"" to reinforce Florentine (and Tuscan) power on the national stage. Regional tensions in Italy's emerging national narrative resurfaced at the end of May with the timely discovery of Dante's bones in Ravenna and that city's own celebration-cum-memorial service. When Dante's remains were returned to his original tomb after three days of public veneration (June 24-26, 1865), the officiating priest couched the discovery of the poet's bones as ""a miracle to justify the prophetic declaration of the hoped-for unity and prosperity of Italy."" Drawing on previously unstudied eye-witness accounts and newspaper coverage in addition to existing scholarship, I argue that the national celebrations of Dante in 1865 belie the continuation of regional rivalries and conflicts—particularly among Florence, Ravenna, and Rome—within Italian social, cultural, and political life in the nineteenth century and beyond.",Guy P.

11180,FB-51501-05,"Most ethnomusicologists are now familiar with Argentine tango, which during the early 20th century was the music and dance identified with urban, hegemonic, Buenos Aires and its European immigrant population.  Such is not the case with folkloric dances from Argentina, which are representative of the provinces of the Argentine interior and national identity.  Although to this day the major areas of the country all have regional songs and dances, with each song-dance form possessing its own corresponding rhythmic pattern and musical instruments, even Argentine ethnomusicologists are often unfamiliar with how they are learned or danced.  Few ethnomusicologists—most notably Carlos Vega (1954)--have done serious research about these dances, and dance manuals (e.g., Berruti 1954, Falú 2011) have not usually shown how they are taught/learned along with music.  To address this gap, I will present a 90-minute participatory workshop in which I will begin with a brief PowerPoint overview of Argentina's main regional dances based on dance lessons I have taken and my related fieldwork.  Among these dances will be the gato, chacarera, zamba (Argentina's national dance), chamamé, malambo, and carnavalito along with their typical rhythmic patterns and instrumentation.  I will then teach participants how to do the gato and chacarera--dances that beginners start with since they have fixed steps and little improvisation—by following the hands-on methodology and diagrams used at local dance schools.  During rest periods, I will provide additional contextual information about Argentine folkloric music and dance.  Sponsors:  LACSEM and the SEM Dance Section.",Jane L.

Even with the current state-of-the-art OCR and NLP technologies, however, there are still some errors for which we plan to deploy crowd- or expert-sourcing techniques for corrections. For this we are developing a web application to correct errors.

11538,AC-50156-12,"A discussion of ""What is ""appropriate"" about appropriate technology?"" The question requires more than a technological or engineering response. The abbreviation of ""appropriate technology"" (AT) can also be read as ""alternative technology."" The second reading suggests a more radical approach to the same think about what we are doing as we replace the natural with the built environment and turn the world into an artifact. It is thus useful to consider the dialogue between these two terms - using two approaches to one particular kind of technology, energy technology. Whether and to what extent we can develop an appropriate or an alternative energy technology will be crucial to the kind of world-artifact we will construct. This contrast will further distinguish two approaches to an ethical assessment of energy: Type I energy ethics is grounded in a belief that increases in energy production and use are both humanizing and civilizing; Type II energy ethics questions this belief and argues that beyond a certain point, energy production and use become counterproductive. Our technological way of life is currently determined by Type I energy ethics, although Type II energy ethics deserves a hearing. A provocative illustration of the Type II approach to energy will reference energy ethics and policy in China.

11656,FO-232742-16,"In the historiography of modern Japan, the term tenko (""ideological conversion"") has come to symbolize the vexed decade of the 1930s. From the mass defections of Japanese Communist Party members earlier in the decade, to the rightward shift of public intellectuals in support of Japan's invasion of China after 1937, tenko signifies the suppression of political opposition and the active mobilization of society for total war. Analyzing this phenomenon in the 1950s, Tsurumi Shunsuke defined tenko as ""a change of thought under the coercion of state power."" Many subsequent studies have reinforced this definition, approaching tenko as when the state exerted pressure in order to have an individual change his/her ideas. &#x0D; However, we must ask: while the state was clearly trying to eradicate communism and other ""dangerous ideas,"" what did it offer in their place? How did state officials understand the process of ""ideological conversion"" and its significance beyond anti-communism? Ultimately, are not the state and its modes of coercion not also ideological? My paper explores how, starting in 1936, justice officials invested tenko with ideological importance as they campaigned in support of the new conversion policy. I will reveal how, in a series of journal articles, symposia and public exhibitions, ""ideological conversion"" inflected tropes of imperial state ideology and consequently became an ideology in its own right.",Max Ward,04/19/2016,"East Asian Studies Workshop, Kyoto University",,,,,The Ideology of Conversion: Tenko as Imperial State Ideology in Late-1930s Japan
11657,FO-232742-16,"Between 1925 and 1945, the Japanese imperial state utilized an anti-radical law called the Peace Preservation Law (Chianijiho) to arrest tens of thousands of people across the empire for what the law defined as threatening Japan's ""national polity,"" or kokutai. Initially used against suspected communists and anti-colonial activists, by the mid-1930s the law was applied to anyone perceived to be challenging imperial orthodoxy, including religious groups, leftist scholars and defense lawyers. While officials were expanding the repressive application of the law, however, they were also developing policies to rehabilitate those they had arrested. Indeed, by the mid-1930s, a policy called ""ideological conversion"" (tenko) had become the cornerstone of the Peace Preservation Law, in which thousands of detainees were ostensibly rehabilitated as loyal and productive subjects of the emperor. &#x0D; &#x0D; This talk explores the unique configuration of repression and rehabilitation in the interwar Japanese Peace Preservation Law. I will focus on a small Tokyo-based parolee support group, the Imperial Renovation Society (Teikoku koshinkai), and how it developed many of the protocols that came to comprise the state's campaign to rehabilitate political criminals as loyal imperial subjects.",Max Ward,11/04/2016,"International and Global Studies Colloquium, Rohatyn Center for Global Affairs, Middlebury College",,,,,Between Repression and Rehabilitation: Reforming Political Criminals in 1930s Japan
11658,FO-232742-16,"Over its twenty-year history, the Peace Preservation Law (1925-1945) was used to arrest thousands of political radicals throughout the Japanese empire for purportedly intending to alter Japan's imperial national polity, or kokutai. State officials saw such intentions as resulting from the infiltration of dangerous foreign ideas such as communism into the Japanese Empire. Consequently they deemed political radicalism ""thought crime"" (shisohan). Although the law was initially used to suppress thought crime, by the mid-1930s it had developed into an apparatus to reform and ""ideologically convert"" (tenko) thought criminals into loyal and productive imperial subjects. In this effort, Buddhist prison chaplains assisted incarcerated political criminals with discarding their dangerous thought, thus infusing ""ideological conversion"" with tropes of Buddhist salvation and spiritual self-negation.&#x0D; &#x0D; In this paper I draw upon Jean-Paul Satre's notion of ""bad faith"" in order to explore the use of Buddhism in the Justice Ministry's efforts to reform political criminals in interwar Japan. I will focus on the writings of Kobayashi Morito and other ex-communists who narrated their ""ideological conversion"" as a process of self-negation and Buddhist salvation, which culminated in their re-identification with the imperial kokutai. While many of these converts continued to work for social welfare and reform into the late-1930s, they did so, they explained, not from political conviction but as selfless acts for others.",Max Ward,07/03/2016,"Asian Studies Conference Japan, International Christian University Tokyo Japan",,,,,Bad Faith: Buddhism and the Rehabilitation of Political Criminals in 1930s Japan
11659,FO-232742-16,"In the mid-1930s, hundreds of incarcerated members of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) publicly renounced the party and communist internationalism – a phenomenon that came to be known as ""ideological conversion,"" or tenko. While some tenkosha (converts) attributed their decision to leave the JCP to a general exhaustion with political activism and a desire to return to their families, many others regarded defection as a chance to reflect upon problems of communist praxis and to rechannel their revolutionary commitments into the idioms of imperial restoration. A passionate debate ensued from 1933 to 1936 among activist tenkosha over the nature of revolutionary restorationism, a debate that this paper argues expressed the ideological paradoxes of fascism. &#x0D; This paper explores the writings of Nakamura Yoshiaki, Sano Manabu, Nabeyama Sadachika and other ex-communists who saw their individual experiences of ideological conversion as the first step towards the total transformation of Japan, East Asia and the world order. Although different in many ways, these tenkosha struggled to theorize an anti-capitalist, revolutionary transformation of Japan as the redemption and recuperation of a national-essence, one that would enable Japan to liberate East Asia from the yoke of Western imperialism.

11712,FA-58054-14,"Yoko Ono has increasingly found recognition as a founding mother of 1960s performance and conceptual art movements and a key mediator of transnational avant-gardes.  Yet little scholarship has addressed the earliest works that established her career in New York in 1961.  This lacuna partly arises from the ephemeral nature of those pieces, which confound disciplinary expectations.  While most critical literature on Ono is written from an art historical angle, remarkably few visual traces remain from her early career.  Moreover, Ono's first performances eschewed formal scores and tape recording, discouraging musicological methods of interpretation.&#x0D; &#x0D; Ono designated her first extended piece ""AOS-for David Tudor"" (1961) as an ""opera.""  Her use of this traditional term may seem surprising given the radical nature of the work, which involved the juxtaposition of animal sounds with human voices, a dehumanizing pile-up of human bodies, primal screaming, and amplified playback of speeches by Hitler and Hirohito.  Blending archival research with a critical reading of Ono's intermedial poetics, this paper follows Ono's lead to consider how ""opera"" clarifies her earliest legacies.  The term speaks to her aspirations as a dramatist accessing a heightened affective register.  It also indicates her desire to ""operate"" in the world.  To appreciate Ono as an ""operatist/operator"" is also to apprehend how strongly her work diverged from the Cagean circles in which she then traveled.  Meant to be spread ""by word of mouth,"" Ono's dramas signaled a critical moment in the politicization of the 60s avant-garde, raising questions that haunt contemporary critical practice.",Brigid Cohen,2/26/2015,Opera Seminar of the Mahindra Center for Humanities at Harvard University,,,,,"“Ono in Opera, 1961"""

He argues that at least for familiar users of mirrors, there is no illusion.

Almost from the start of the novel, Veneering uses dinner parties to lay the foundation for this other sort of party work, anchoring his feasts in that ""innocent piece of dinner-furniture,"" Mr. Twemlow, whom the omniscient narrator describes in terms that deliberately blur the lines between animate and inanimate matter, consumers and the consumed, human subjects and the gaudy objects feasted upon by the Veneerings and their kind. His blurring, I would suggest, is the point. Set against the novel's beginning on the murky Thames, which includes Gaffer Hexam and Rogue Riderhood's quarrel over whether ""a dead man has any use for money,"" the Veneering dinner party opens up a space for evaluating not the banal stirrings of political partisanship but rather a much more complicated debate, in which Gaffer's natural argument that a dead man cannot own, want, or spend money collides with the unnatural but legal claims of Old Harmon's will, a tool designed to allow him to continue to order the workings of property long after he is dead. Taken from Chapter 5 of my book in progress, this paper examines particularly the dinner parties that frame Our Mutual Friend—the one thrown by the Veneerings in Chapter 2, and the one that closes the novel in ""The Voice of Society""—to show how these events posit and critique modern forms of capitalist consumption that commoditize the Victorian subject precisely by underscoring the ways in which these violate Gaffer's ""natural"" laws of ownership and exchange.",Sean Grass,4/24/15,"Birkbeck College, University of London",,,,,Willing Subjects and Commodity Culture in Our Mutual Friend

12108,RZ-51445-12,"From approximately the mid-fifteenth to the end of the twelfth century B.C. Egypt's New Kingdom empire was served by a fortress and harbor at the Canaanite port of Jaffa (anc. Yapu). The fortress served as a staging ground for regular military campaigns into Canaan and the administration of its imperial territories throughout Canaan. Although the outlines of Jaffa's role has long been known from a handful of textual references, recent research by the Jaffa Cultural Heritage Project under the direction of Aaron A. Burke (University of California, Los Angeles) and Martin Peilstöcker (Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz) has led to a major reassessment of the Egyptian presence in Jaffa. The excavations have permitted not only an elucidation of the history of the fortress, but also the nature of interactions between Egyptians and Canaanites during this lengthy period. Of particular note is the evidence for violent interactions over more than three centuries, climaxing in the late twelfth century B.C. This lecture presents a synthesis of NEH-funded archaeological research between 2011 and 2016 and its historical implications for understanding resistance to and social interaction within the Egyptian stronghold of Jaffa during the New Kingdom.",Aaron A.

While their residents often have limited incomes, their property values have been rising while crime is sharply declining; indeed, so much so that these areas are increasingly likely to undergo gentrification. And in places with fewer immigrants, many municipal governments have made official efforts to attract residents from overseas in hopes of harnessing human mobility to revitalize underpopulated neighborhoods—Global Detroit and the Global Cleveland Initiative represent just two programs of this kind. In the meantime, what had been a sustained influx of people from Latin America has largely come to a halt: for example, by the mid-2000s net migration from Mexico had fallen to zero, or, according to some enumerations, become a net emigration. This has not been due to a lack of new arrivals. Rather, it is because many migrants have been departing for their homelands, whether to pursue opportunities or simply retire there; the upshot has been a tide of return migration to Latin America.",A.

His unique sound and commercial success in the 1920s made him one of the most popular and influential blues musicians of all time. His music and the blues generally, are a unique genre with themes that reflect our nation's history and the African American experience from slavery, through generations of discrimination, the fight for equality and the everyday challenges we all face today. Blind Lemon's Last Blues is a one-man play with music by Alan Govenar and Akin Babatunde about the day, December 19, 1929, when the legendary blues singer Blind Lemon Jefferson died in the snow in Chicago. Songs and monologues bring to life the voices of Blind Lemon Jefferson and his contemporaries, including Blind Willie Johnson, Lillian Glinn, Hattie Hudson, Bobbie Cadillac, and Lead Belly. Blind Lemon's Last Blues is a story of the deep human need to find purpose in the foibles of life.","Alan Govenar, Akin Babatunde",6/30/2017,"Bullock Texas State History Museum, Austin, Texas",,,,,Texas Artist Series: Blind Lemon's Last Blues-Bullock
12226,FA-233427-16,"This talk takes up the intersection of material acts and literary representation:  how black writers of the 1850s thought about slave uprisings, communal defense against kidnapping and capture, and the founding of maroon communities as models for revolutionary citizenship; how they represented them in literature; and how they theorized literary representation as part of a revolutionary process, ""a form of political insurgency"" that Franz Fanon describes in The Wretched of the Earth as ""awakening the mind,"" but which Frances Ellen Watkins Harper figures in terms of conversion through encounters with the [slave] sublime.   Harper's writing, speaking, and activism in particular explored the cultural work necessary for sustaining a prolonged battle for emancipation, even if, or perhaps especially when, violent conflict seemed not only imminent, but also necessary.   She draws on local models—Margaret Garner (who killed her youngest daughter, rather than see her returned to slavery in December 1856), the ""Tennessee Hero"" (who died under torture rather than divulge the names of slave insurrectionaries in 1856) and John Brown—along with a broader black Atlantic and biblical archive as resources for instilling a revolutionary ethos in her readers and as multi-modal response to the complicated, chaotic, and dour outlook at the start of the 1860s.",Derrick R.

WAIVS or Workflows for the Analysis of Images in Visual Stylometry is designed to support the use of digital image analysis techniques by researchers in the humanities with little to no computer science background. The workshop will introduce participants to the field of visual stylometry through a series of hands-on exercises using WAIVS. Visual stylometry is a new field that lies at the intersection of art, cognitive science, computer science, and the digital humanities. Researchers in this field use digital image analysis tools to study the image features and image statistics of artistic style. This information can be used to classify paintings by era, school, individual artist within a school, technique, or period within the body of work of an individual artist, and to provide insight into the unique ways that different painters communicate through the subject matter or medium.&#x0D; &#x0D; Speakers at the workshop include Fitchburg Art Museum Director or Curator, Daniel J.

The general scholarly consensus has been that, the poet of the Iliad was the first to imitate spoken dirges improvised antiphonally by women at funerals and to render these speeches in hexametrical form. I will argue to the contrary that the embedded laments in the Iliad provide us with the earliest evidence for a short genre of hexametrical lament chanted primarily by women at the funerals of relatives and in the cult of Adonis. As we shall see, the very early existence of the latter tradition greatly helps explain why the poet uniquely likens both Kassandra and Briseis to the goddess Aphrodite at the moment when they begin to keen out loud for a dead young man – that is: just as the goddess once did for Adonis.",Christopher Faraone,2/12/2016,Stanford University,https://arts.stanford.edu/event/christopher-faraone-u-chicago-female-lament-in-the-iliad-the-play-of-hexametrical-genres-in-homeric-epic/,,,,Female Lament in the Iliad

13058,HB-231968-16,"Robert Solomon's ""On grief and gratitude"" is perhaps the best known contemporary philosophical article on grief. There Solomon makes the provocative claim that there is a duty to grieve – that those who do not grieve or do not grieve sufficiently are subject to ""the most severe moral censure,"" that as a ""moral emotion,"" grief is not only an ""appropriate reaction to the loss of a loved one, but also in a strong sense obligatory."" While Solomon offer reasons why grief speaks positively of a person's relations with others and why grief may contribute to the bereaved's well-being, he does not offer an explicit argument for the obligatoriness of grief. Here I consider a number of routes by which such a claim might be defended. If there is a duty to grieve, its object must be other living people (those with whom one shares grief at a particular person's death), the deceased for whom one grieves, or oneself. The first two, I argue, are likely to be candidates for duties of mourning, i.e., duties to engage in public or ritualistic memorialization or acknowledgements of the deceased's death, etc. Only the last, a duty to grieve owed to oneself, is a credible candidate for a duty to grieve. For insofar as grief is an egocentric activity, it responds to the death of a person with whom one stands in an identity-constituting relationship and hence involves the attempt to re-establish or place on new terms that relationship in light of that individual's death. The source of a self-concerning duty to grieve is that grief thus represents both an opportunity for, and motivator of, self-knowledge, that is, knowledge of one's practical identity and values. The duty to grieve, I conclude, is a non-enforceable duty to oneself whose non-fulfillment should elicit agent-centered regret.",Michael Cholbi,05/08/18,"Deakin University, Australia",,,,,The Duty to Grieve

13103,FA-233454-16,"This paper posits the importance of large-scale structures to Classic Maya literature and poetics. Building on discourse analysis, the ethnography of speaking, and ethnopoetics, I analyze a selection of narratives to reveal complex structures that may be divided into stanzas, verses, and framing chiasms based on the internal repetition of parallel structures, some of which are of greater scale than the kenning, couplet, or triplet, so often mentioned in discussions of Maya poetics. These large-scale organizing devices coordinate with the temporal structure of the narrative but are not identical with them, even if both work to frame the central axis of the narrative. The comparison of these large-scale features allows for the identification of an aspect of Maya poetics that has traditionally been understudied, but is nevertheless of critical importance to understanding Classic period literature and verbal art.",Michael D.

13125,FA-251827-17,"Public health was vital to the success of the American pacification campaign and the ""civilizing process"" in the Philippines during the early years of the twentieth century. In 1905, American colonial officials established a leper colony in Culion, southwest of Manila. Victor Heiser, Director of Health in the Philippines from 1905 to 1915, declared that to protect public health it was necessary to remove leprous individuals from their homes and transfer those who tested positive for leprosy to Culion. In May 1906, the first group of 358 adults and some adolescents were transported to Culion. By the end of 1910, more than 5000 men, women, and children were brought to the island and Culion became one of the largest leprosaria in the world by the 1930s. Citing limited resources and difficulty of pregnancy for leprous women, health authorities segregated male and female patients, and banned cohabitation and marriage in 1907. The patients ignored these restrictions. It was reinstated in 1927, causing a lot of resentment from male and female patients. Opposition to these regulations culminated in a violent protest on March 25, 1932, dubbed ""The Manchuria.""   Early works on Culion tends to highlight its role as a laboratory for civic experimentation and how it was embroiled in major political issues of the day. Recent studies have highlighted patients' resistance, but they focused on men as leaders and main participants of the 1932 protest. Here, women tended to be presented as followers of men. Gendered assumptions by the state, priests and nuns, and male patients that women needed to be ""protected"" remains uninterrogated. I argue that women found ways to challenge the gender-based segregation of patients and restrictions on leper marriages within the leper colony. They asserted their sense of self, thereby rejecting the notion of women as weak, mere followers of male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.",Febe Pamonag,3/28/2018,"Maples Library, Western Illinois University",http://www.wiu.edu/wiucalendar/index.sphp?id=31876,Advertisement for the panel discussion on Western Illinois University Online calendar.,http://www.wiu.edu/cas/,Advertisement on the College of Arts and Sciences website -- Upcoming Events.,The Women of Culion

The project takes its name from the only copy of Latin Jubilees, which is joined by the only copies anywhere of the Testament of Moses and an Arian commentary on the Gospel of Luke. After the successful imaging of these erased texts in January of 2017, the scope of objects of interest broadened to other significant palimpsests at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, such as Origen's Hexapla and a fourth-century translation of biblical books into Gothic. A long-term plan to systematically digitize illegible manuscripts is underway. A major advance in capture and processing technology created by the project is Spectral RTI, which combines the advantages of spectral imaging in color processing with the advantages of RTI in texture and interactivity. The addition of texture imaging can aid the recovery of text—for example if now-missing ink left an outline of corrosion on the surface of the parchment—and much more information about scribal practices from the creation and use of the manuscript.",Todd R.

I demonstrate that fortunetellers are channeled through heteropatriarchal gender norms and limited employment chances into an informal divination economy, where they are criminalized by a secularist ban against fortunetelling and stigmatized by an Islamist condemnation of unorthodox religious practices. I conclude that fortunetellers foster public spaces for the articulation of otherwise marginalized feelings of their women and LGBTIQ clients, ironically, at the expense of the devaluation of the labors of these same underprivileged groups.",Zeynep Korkman,04/18/2017,"University of California, Los Angeles, Gender Studies",http://www.genderstudies.ucla.edu/event/zeynep-korkman-gendered-fortunes-feelings-labors-and-publics-divination-turkey-0,"lecture announcement, Irene Flecknoe Ross Lecture",,,"Gendered Fortunes: Feelings, Labors, and Publics of Divination in Turkey"

13232,RA-228605-15,"Despite religious proscriptions and practices, currents of alcohol never wholly ceased flowing into Ottoman or Republican Turkey. Until the nineteenth century, most Turks generally observed this prohibition—or secretly evaded it. During and since that time, however, drinking became culturally habituated among many sectors of the population, with the anise-flavored raki being recognized by most as the ‘national drink' of Turkey. Influenced by global temperance movements, especially in America and Europe, traditional moral and progressive medical arguments in Turkey found a common cause in their opposition to alcohol that led to a legal ban in 1920. Fusing arguments of public health and piety, prohibitionist legislation passed by the narrowest of margins. The tenor of these debates included, however, particular references to fiscal insecurity, to the roles of ethno-religious minorities, and to foreign powers that ranged from cautious, to stridently nationalist, and to intolerant xenophobia. Simultaneously, the global currents both for and against prohibition played roles in shaping the arguments found in the Turkish debates.

13396,FT-54309-06,"Classic work on migration by scholars across several disciplines typically assumed male migrants.  More recent work acknowledges that women migrate, too-and not always with husbands or fathers.  Moreover, work attentive to feminist theory explores how the experiences of female migrants might vary dramatically from those of their male counterparts.  In this talk, I explore the riveting case of Cabo Verdean women migrants in the U.S. and Europe, many of  whom have fled poverty, spousal abuse, maternal neglect, and other traumas in the West African nation of Cabo Verde.  Emotional refugees, these women have nevertheless found varying levels of comfort, educational achievement, and even prosperity in new lands, thanks to a combination of strong social networks, more gender-egalitarian morés, government support, and educational programs.  Other women left thriving lives in Cabo Verde to join their children who they had sent afar for better educational and other opportunities.  In these more complicated cases, upward mobility for the children may be counterbalanced by downward mobility for their mothers.  In this talk, I share a rich selection of women's voices to complicate and humanize the stories of migration that hide behind the numbers in the newspapers.",Alma Gottlieb,04/20/2018,"National Taiwan University (Taipei, Taiwan)",https://www.facebook.com/ntuwrp/photos/pb.297267830383357.-2207520000.1525541111./1486439124799549/?type=3&amp;theater,"Facebook for the Women's and Gender Research Program, National Taiwan University",,,"Women's Travels, Women's Traumas: Engendering the Cabo Verdean Diaspora"

Over four years ago, several of us took DNA tests from a popular company. When we got matches as cousins, we got together and that was the start of something monumental.   Present on the panel were 12 of us who had appeared on Genealogy Roadshow. Penelope had made a large family tree chart which she and Brian used to explain the relationships. Family members came from the New Orleans area, Baton Rouge, and Chicago to participate. They answered many question about DNA testing and how exactly our black and white sides were connected. We also discussed how this event has affected our lives in the most beautiful ways. Cameran Battley, our young cousin from Chicago, said that our story is a beautiful story and is truly an American story. She encouraged the others to think about having their DNA tested to find out about themselves.

The Olivos were one of many families in Pointe Coupee that had branches ""blanc"" and ""de couleur."" The branch of color stemmed from George Olivo II, with one of his enslaved labor force, a black woman named Magdelaine. In 1801, Olivo emancipated Magdelaine, then aged 40 years, along with their (his) five natural children. He died two years later, and in his last will and testament, he left his natural de couleur family all of his property, including a farm on the New Roads side of False River.  Of particular interest to those in attendance was the fact that many of the individuals mentioned in the story had direct descendants present in the audience.

The exhibit's arrival was also pushed back, so the exhibit was not available for viewing.

Dr. Keeling gave an overview of the exhibit and gave historical interpretation about the information presented on the panels. People were not upset about the exhibit not being there and lingered for about thirty minutes after discussing the exhibit itself, the upcoming related programs, and, of course, the ice!

The group watched a brief film on Harriet Tubman, read Freedom in Congo Square by Carole Boston Weatherford and An Apple For Harriet Tubman by Glennette Turner. They then discussed what they thought slavery was and what they would think the best and safest way to escape was.  This small (and interesting!) discussion led to the discussion of the legendary freedom quilts. The kids and parents were instructed to make their own patterns on cardstock using color pencils, markers, crayons, or water colors. The children then would have to come up with what their patterns stood for. The plan was to put all the cardstock patterns on a wall to make our own 'quilt' for display near the exhibit.

We discussed the impact of slavery in Louisiana, and how the book dispels the myth that slavery in Louisiana was """"relatively gentle"""", and we discussed how we dealt with the repercussions of slavery in the 1800s and how we're still dealing today. The book was a tough read for everyone, but everyone felt like it was an important read, and everyone felt enlightened in some way after the reading. We checked out all thirty books ordered; one African American women's church group checked out ten for their book club. Several more people emailed me their opinions of the books and their ideas of how it tied to today.

13537,AC-253408-17,"By the late twentieth century, opposition to torture was accepted as an almost universal principle. Yet after 9/11, the permissibility of torture suddenly burst onto the scene as an open question. This presentation analyses how justifications of torture entered the American public sphere via the mainstream media after 9/11, largely ignoring the possibility that torture was already occurring and framing it in hypothetical terms. Rather than grappling with the possibility that the U.S. was already torturing prisoners, media commentators posed the justification of torture as a moral and legal concern with regard to potential future action. In addition, much of this early public debate focused on the fantasy scenario of the ""ticking time bomb,"" in which it is imagined that a terrorist has been captured and will not reveal the location of a ticking bomb set to go off.",Dr. Lisa Stampnitzky,04/10/2018,"LaGuardia Community College, NYC",,,,,Justifying Torture in the Public Sphere

How do these images appeal to their audiences, and why does this focus persist? This talk will consider the history of humanitarianism through the lens of the camera and its focus on the child.

13670,RA-228502-15,"The catalogue entry for Egypt's participation in the Great Exhibition of 1851 lists the displayed objects. They include pipes, textiles, stone samples from the country's quarries, craft goods, samples of fauna, tools as well as some industrial goods. The curated list of objects was meant to present Egypt on the international stage as an ancient, traditional yet modernizing country full of resources. Since that first exhibition Egypt put on numerous displays at international expositions as well as domestically, all staged to focus on the country's modernization, production and industrialization. In international expos ancient artifacts were key aspects of the display, often positioned near the entrance or in a dedicated room with museum-like displays.  In the twentieth century Egypt's staged displays underwent a sort of rebranding aiming to forcibly position the country as modern and progressive both to international and Egyptian audiences. The displays carefully integrated architecture, display design and the selection of objects and industries represented. In this paper, exhibitions held in Cairo in 1926, 1936, 1949 and 1958 are discussed in terms of their architectures and the construction of images that put into sharp relief the state's positioning of the materiality of modernity in the Egyptian context.  Egypt's participation in the 1939 and 1964 New York World's Fairs as well as the 1958 Brussels World's Fair are also discussed. This history of displaying Egypt by the Egyptian state forms an important historical precedent to the Modern Egypt Project at the British Museum.

The corpus of flasks has not been reassessed since the 1970s. Since then, archaeological discoveries have offered important new contextual information about the uses of these souvenir flasks. The flasks visually emphasize monuments still standing in late imperial Puteoli and Baiae that connected the cities to Rome and its emperors. Although we cannot be sure of the agents behind the flasks' design, it is suggested that the cities' civic leaders and glassworks' owners might have collaborated. The talk also argues that glass was an ideal material for the Campanian souvenirs, straddling the line between luxury and affordability while also being perceived as characteristic of Puteoli and Baiae. The personal and cultural value of the flasks ultimately derived from a combination of their material , iconography, and status as portable souvenirs, which resulted in a wide range of uses after their purchase, from domestic decorations to votive offerings and grave goods.",Maggie L.

13790,FA-251491-17,"The Roman Empire produced a rich range of souvenirs and memorabilia commemorating cities, monuments, sporting and theatrical events, and religious rituals. At a time when literacy was limited and visual communication was essential, these objects were a critical means for generating and mediating memory and knowledge of their represented subjects. This talk examines various examples of Roman souvenirs and memorabilia, including glass flasks engraved with scenes of tourist destinations, miniature replicas of famous cult statues, and drinking cups with pictures of famous gladiators and charioteers. It explores how these objects constructed knowledge in an era before mechanical and digital reproduction. Although often overlooked by historians of Roman art, souvenirs and memorabilia shed fascinating light on how objects and images helped ancient Romans conceptualize their world.",Maggie L.

In short, I want to know what was created and what was repeated. I also want to determine the value of what was created – its cost, utility, or the esteem in which it was held, for example. I argue that this can be accomplished by combining data gathered from my analysis of three medieval primary source-types from the city of Ghent (in what is now Belgium) with broad interdisciplinary reading – of medieval theology, such as the theology of creation – never before considered for music, comparisons of music in cities, studies of repetition in mathematics, philosophy, biology, linguistics, education, and scholarship on the modern Church.

Navigating the tensions and complexities of Granada—the last redoubt of Islam in early modern Spain—he mobilized Latin erudition to claim liberty, financial stability, and public renown. This lecture examines the changing narratives of Juan Latino's fama as a poet and educator of Renaissance Spain. In life, he cannily deployed Latin, Europe's only cosmopolitan literary language, to conjure visions of a global empire for king Philip II while also warning this king about how racial bias would diminish his world power. Yet poets in the seventeenth century concealed Juan Latino's accomplishments in vernacular poems steeped in the emerging tropes of minstrelsy. It is fitting, therefore, that a research trip to Spain in 1926 by an intellectual of the Harlem Renaissance recovered the epic of Juan Latino.

13859,FA-251630-17,"In Tunisia, trance rituals animated by praise songs to Sufi saints are not exclusive to members of Sufi orders or participants in Sufi ceremonies. Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, those of women, Jews, blacks, and hard-drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical ""journey"" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community. This paper emphasizes the important role of women and minorities in cultivating Sufi aesthetics, and shows how Sufism resonates throughout Tunisian society via listening publics associated with numerous genres of music—both ""sacred"" and ""secular""—that evoke the spiritual and therapeutic power of music and trance. Based on ethnographic research between 2009 and 2015, this presentation takes as its starting point the changing politico-religious climate after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 and the concomitant threats to the survival of musical practices associated with Muslim saints.",Richard Jankowsky,11/21/2017,"Center for the Humanities at Tufts University, Medford, MA",,,,,Ambient Sufism: Devotional Plurality and Music as Everyday Mysticism in Tunisia

Participants are invited to read the same book in advance and then join the scholar-led discussion with others at the festival.  The One Book, One Festival selection for 2018 is the Depression-era comic masterpiece The Great Big Doorstep: A Novel, by E. P. O'Donnell. The novel centers on the Crochets, a Cajun family who live in a ramshackle house between the levee and the Mississippi River. The Crochets dream of one day owning a stately plantation befitting the magnificent cypress doorstep they have salvaged from the river and proudly display outside their humble home.  The memorable characters in this novel have their own concerns: the patriarch, Commodo, is full of wild bravado as he fluctuates between scheming, laboring, and malingering; his wife reigns as the queen of retort, though toughened by years of making do and doing without. The Crochet children also cope with personal struggles: Topal, twenty, restless, and moody, and recently dumped by her fiancé; Arthur, eighteen, attempts to strike out on his own while dodging the coddling of his mother and the fury of his father; Evvie, almost fifteen, plans to join a religious order after renouncing a lover; and twins Gussie and Paul, and baby T.

14199,HT-251006-16,"This lecture discusses key elements of network analysis from the perspective of historians, providing insights into the possibilities and limitations this method offers. It is the intent of this lecture to illustrate a journey and learning process in modelling historical networks. After an introduction on the basic terminology and concepts of network analysis, we will discuss how we can transform archival sources in network data. This is not an easy task: archival research often presents us with complex, fragmentary and uncertain data that are hard to reconcile with the required precision of digital technology. To bridge this gap, we will discover how the use of multi-layered networks may provide a powerful outcome to tackle both complexity and fragmentation in archival data. Following that, we will see how we can enrich and quantify our archival based network with data-mining from datasets. By doing so, I will show how various network measurements can highlight the different roles that individual nodes play in a network. In explaining these methods, I will use examples from my own research on early modern correspondence networks.   EMDA2017 prepared me to teach this introductory course on network analysis in historical research.",Ingeborg van Vugt,01/10/2018,"Marten-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Interdisziplinäres Zentrum für die Erforschung der Europäischen Aufklärung,)",,,,,Historical Network Analysis: A journey through modelling and exploring early modern correspondence

14591,RQ-50772-13,"In the course of an NEH-funded project to transcribe and translate the lyrics of central Javanese gamelan music, it became clear that something highly unusual was going on in the way some of the texts were being used. Indeed, the singing in traditional Javanese gamelan music represents an extreme, among the world's vocal musics, of fragmentation and discontinuity. Moreover, many of the texts are difficult for the average listener to understand because of their heavy doses of archaic words and their subtle word play, made all the more incomprehensible by melisma, the surrounding thick instrumental texture, breaths taken mid word, and the aforementioned fragmentation. As a result of this, much of the time, audiences--and even singers--do not pay much attention to the meaning of the words that are being sung. In much of the more recent repertoire, however, the words do take on a more expressive role, and become a focus of attention. Using Rossana Dalmonte's typology of text-music relations in vocal music (2004), I propose to demonstrate the range of roles the lyrics play in Javanese gamelan music, depending on the literary and musical genre, and to consider the question of why certain texts, of extremely high literary value, are used over and over, despite being only vaguely understood, at best, by most singers and listeners.

Both professors provided exhaustive overviews that infused history, close readings of references from slave autobiographies, and literary theory. The early part of the discussion seemed more like an academic conference amongst peers rather than a public discussion. Nonetheless, the immense knowledge that both scholars brought to their opening comments were well received. It was apparent that both Drs. Ward and Worthy possessed an exhaustive knowledge of the antebellum era, literary works and authors, literary conventions often found in slave narratives, and that each genuinely enjoyed studying/researching the topic.

14645,FA-252520-17,"Drawing on several decades of Critical Race Theory scholarship and historical studies of race in the United States, this project challenges the black/white binary by demonstrating the centrality of Mexican Americans to one of the most important school desegregation cases in U.S. history, Keyes v. School District No. One (1973). The case hinged on Mexican American racial identity. If they were white, then many Denver schools were not segregated. If Mexican Americans were nonwhite, however, then those same schools were segregated. Beyond the courtroom, Denver citizens contemplated this issue on their own, a debate that remained relevant long after the Supreme Court ruled. Many people, moreover, used Mexican American children's ambiguous racial identity to challenge the court's desegregation plan. The existence of such racial uncertainty, I argue, is one of the hallmarks of the operation of race in modern America. People's inability to categorize Mexican Americans as either white or black, and subsequent debates about Mexican Americans' location along the racial spectrum, raised questions about the legitimacy of court-ordered desegregation. Racial uncertainties thus served an important ideological and political purpose: in the post-civil rights era, when overt racism was no longer socially acceptable, anti-integration voices utilized the indeterminacy of Mexican American racial identity to frame their opposition to school desegregation. That some Mexican Americans were among these voices only added credibility to the idea that court-ordered desegregation was not only illegal, but un-American.",Danielle R.

14664,AQ-51123-14,"How is peace understand and experienced?  Using the nexus of community and culture as a lens to explore what peace means, this interdisciplinary panel presents three papers to examine cultural meanings of virtue, race, and conflict in order to understand the attainment of peace or its limitations.   Literary scholar Donna Gessell claims that Flannery O'Connor's short story ""The Artificial Nigger"" should be included in the category of ""overlooked or under-appreciated visions of peace."" O'Connor contests notions of peace and violence through her characters' confrontation of culture and place in the short story, published in 1955. Philosopher Yi Deng explores how the illustrious virtue in the Great Learning is an approach to peace. Instead she argues that reinterpreting illustrative virtues in The Great Learning, ignored in the wave of reviving Confucian political philosophy, will advance the development of Confucian political virtues in more global contexts.  Historian Michael Proulx explores the idea of community in strife and the modeling of virtuous behavior that emerges from it in Ancient Greece and India. He makes the point that, while intense conflict plague each community, model values and virtues of peace occur within the domestic settings of each culture, where hospitality customs temper adversaries  as people strove to develop their own unique forms of peace. It will examine sections of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey to develop a view of ancient Greek standards of virtue within a community under the stress of conflict and war.","Renee Bricker, Yi Deng, Donna Gessell, Michael Proulx",02/27/2016,"Dahlonega, GA",,,,,Peace at the nexus of culture and place

Dr. Ahland confirmed the existence of this language and ethnicity in 2014 when she made her first fieldtrip to the area. The B‘aga languages exhibit typological rarities not known to exist in other African languages, e.g. verbal classifiers (Ahland 2010). Furthermore, Daats'i´in and the Gumuz languages don‘t always exhibit the typical patterns found in the neighboring Nilo-Saharan languages and for that reason, at least one linguist has proposed they form an isolate family (Dimmendaal 2011) and should not be considered Nilo-Saharan as they traditionally have (Greenberg 1963, Bender 1997, Ehret 2001).

14816,RZ-230366-15,"Public sharing of food and gifts remains important to St'át'imc communities of interior British Columbia today despite decades of prohibition by Canadian authorities.  The archaeological record offers evidence that public events involving large-scale food preparation and sharing were commonly practiced at least since ca. 1300 years ago.  Yet, we have little understanding of variation in how such events were developed and operated.  We know even less about the social dimensions of public rituals involving sharing of food and goods.  This paper explores the archaeology of food-related public ritual (feasting) and related activities (e.g. potlatching) in the Middle Fraser Canyon of British Columbia.  Drawing data from the Bell, Bridge River, and Keatley Creek sites, we assess (1) variation in time and space in the nature of such rituals; (2) potential socio-economic and political explanations for variation; and (3) relationships between historical and contemporary practice.","Anna Marie Prentiss, Alysha Edwards",04/12/2019,"Society for American Archaeology meetings, Albuquerque NM",http://saa.org,,,,"Scrambles, Potlatches, and Feasts: The Archaeology of Public Rituals amongst the St’át’imc People of Interior British Columbia."
14817,RZ-230366-15,"This paper focuses on understanding how lineage-based and clan-based connections structured labor patterns and access to prestige/power within a multi-generational housepit (HP54) over time. The Bridge River site (EeRl4), located in the Mid-Fraser Canyon, British Columbia, Canada, was generally egalitarian, but shows variation and situated power-differentials in terms of wealth and influence of individuals or groups based on familial, lineage, and/or clan connections across several generations. These relationships were likely negotiated both within households and externally between houses as well. Due to the longevity of occupation of HP54 (roughly 346 years), this housepit may be representative of long-lived kin groups who were connected to the initial construction of the housepit, and/or to each sequential expansion of the space. Clan-based resource connections and spatially-defined traditions were potentially passed down through generations, a possibility reinforced by the presence of multifloor/multi-generational site furniture (e.g. in situ grinding stones). Through an examination of changing patterns in subsistence resource management and the use of space across these occupational floors, we examine micro- and macro-scale shifts in lineage-based connections or alliances at this household level in order to illuminate how such connections interplay with the development of prestige-based social distinctions and subsequent access to power.

Substantial evidence has been provided that complex hunter-gathererfisher communities occupied sites in these river drainages during the late Holocene. Some chronological frameworks suggest there are similarities across the region while others indicate disparate timing of cultural developments spanning material culture, settlement patterns, and sociopolitical organizations. This paper presents Bayesian models for late Holocene sites the Middle Fraser and Upper Columbia River areas. Results suggest that while region-wide chronologies have been adopted, Bayesian models predict very different occupational histories for villages in the Mid-Fraser and Upper Columbia River areas.

15009,FEL-258145-18,"In the course of this talk, my aim is to convince you that the standard narrative of 18th- and 19th-century American constitutional history is incomplete.  It is incomplete because it focuses too narrowly on two great constitutional moments: first, the founding period from 1787 to 1791, when the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were drafted, debated, and ratified; and second, the period between 1861 and 1870, which witnessed the Civil War and the drafting, debating, and ratification of the Reconstruction amendments.  For many scholars, the founding and Reconstruction are the two signal events in American constitutional history prior to the 20th century.  Bruce Ackerman of Yale has deemed them ""constitutional moments"" – periods in which ""We the people"" engage in conscious acts of constitutional creation and transformation.  The founding and Reconstruction certainly qualify.  The founding was the point of origin, and Reconstruction was the moment of reckoning.  My focus today, though, is not a point or a moment.  It is a four-decade-long argument.  The period between 1815 and 1861 – the end of the War of 1812, right here in New Orleans, and the beginning of the Civil War, up in Charleston Harbor – was a constitutional era unto itself.  It was not simply the hangover from the founding; nor was it merely the prelude to the Civil War.  These 46 years contained within them an unparalleled period of creativity in constitutional thought.  The constitutional world looked different in 1861 from the way it had looked in 1815.

That backlash restrained the press as well as Congress in their attempts to investigate U.S. intelligence activities, and it is among the reasons why Glomar played an underappreciated but pivotal role in saving the CIA from the clutches of transparency. In short, Glomar changed the conversation, working to establish new limits on the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate culture of disclosure. And this presentation tells the program's history both to provide an alternative perspective on the 1970s, a decade known for expansive openness, and to weigh in on America's perennial struggle to balance the demands of democracy with the need for secrecy in national security and foreign policy.",M.

15092,FA-251827-17,"Dr. Pamonag will speak on the subject of patient activism in the Culion leper colony during the first three decades of U.S. rule in the Philippines. Beginning in 1906, American health officials in the Philippines ordered the mandatory confinement of Hansen's disease patients to the island of Culion, southwest of Manila. This was the American colonial government's solution to what health officials suggested was a major public health problem in the Philippines. Health officials had downplayed Filipino patients' opposition to the order for mandatory confinement and the ban on marriage and cohabitation that was introduced in 1907.  This lecture critically engages with how a gendered rhetoric of protection muted women's voices in both contemporary accounts and scholarly works on resistance in Culion. The pervasive rhetoric of protecting women's health, wellbeing, and morals obscured women's exercise of agency and struggle for autonomy against male and female authority figures. Drawing on contemporary accounts of a March 1932 protest against the ban on marriage and cohabitation as well as some primary evidence from the patients themselves, this presentation will bring several examples of women's subversion of such rhetoric to the forefront. They rejected the notion of women as mere followers of Filipino men and wards of the Catholic nuns and the American colonial state.",Febe Pamonag,03/22/2019,"Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University",https://calendar.niu.edu/event/cseas friday lecture dr febe pamonag western illinois university associate professor of history#.XNtDvtWFPu0,Northern Illinois University event calendar,,,(En)Gendering Patient Activism in the Culion Leper Colony

15438,FT-264476-19,"Welcome to a special talk by Dr. Frederick H. White, Professor of Russian and Integrated Studies at Utah Valley University.   Influenced by the theories of Pierre Bourdieu and Pascale Casanova, this lecture explores the role of the scholar and translator in consecrating the work of Ernest Hemingway for the Soviet literary market. Ivan Kashkin (1899-1963) was the leading translator of the American writer's work into Russian, including a two-volume edition of selected works in 1959, and the author of the influential critical-biography, Ernest Hemingway, published in Moscow in 1966. Translation is a crucial element in the attainment of literary capital beyond the author's national borders, therefore Kashkin's publications legitimized Hemingway's literary works within the Soviet Union as early as 1934. This lecture will concentrate on Hemingway's introduction to the Soviet market in the 1930s; his exclusion from it due to the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls; Kashkin's ""re-reading"" of Hemingway in the 1950s, and publication of his Soviet biography in 1971.   Speaker's bio: Dr. Frederick H. White is Professor of Russian and Integrated Studies at Utah Valley University. He has published six books and over thirty academic articles on Russian literature, film and culture. He is one of the leading specialists on the writer Leonid Andreev and has published in the areas of Russian Modernism, psychology and literature in the Russian fin de siècle, the economics of culture and post-Soviet cinema. Recently, he has published a book of memoirs, interviews, scholarly essays and biographical documents that relate to the recently deceased filmmaker Aleksei Balabanov. At present, he is working on a book provisionally titled Hemingway in the Soviet Union, which concentrates on the efforts made by Soviet literary agents to interest the American author in the Soviet experiment.  #talk #culture #literature",Frederick H.

We will also review opportunities in digitization that were earlier unfeasible. We will discuss recent collaborative work amongst archivists to address videotape digitization issues. This includes the creation of online manuals, resources, and software, such as those developed in the amiaopensource GitHub organizational account. We hope to address the challenges of analog tape digitization and demystify the entire process of planning and maintaining in-house audio and videotape digitization projects.

15610,RZ-249965-16,"Salapia, a port-town on the Adriatic Coast of southeastern Italy, was founded in the 1st c. BCE and developed as a vibrant urban settlement, maintained into the mid-5th c. CE, whose fortunes were closely tied to its trading connections and its salt production. Our excavations from 2014-2018 have identified the remains of an elite Roman domus, a tannery, a possible small bath, and a taberna, installed and then refurbished over five centuries. However, starting in the second half of the 5th c. CE, residents reoccupied the structures of Roman Salapia, while transforming the material characteristics to suit their needs. Rather than reading them as ruins, the skeleton of the Roman structures informed the organization of the community over time, encouraging the continued habitation of this coastal zone as a resource much like the salt still extracted from the lagoon landscape. Some still standing remains were fundamental perhaps to forming the foundation on which medieval castrum of Salpi was constructed, while those covered over were robbed to build the new town. In these ways, over the centuries, the inhabitants of this coast made and re-made materially and socially their communities.  Still today, the Monte di Salpi, an artificial ""hill"" that encapsulates the remains of the medieval town, provides a touchstone for the local community of Trinitapoli, the site of its earliest history and what it means to be a salinaro (inhabitant of the lagoon landscape). So our work, resurrecting these ruins and making the local community a fundamental part of this conversation, has made it clear that this is not a past ""dead and gone"", but rather, that the archaeological remains form part of a living legacy that brings Salapia into the 21st century.","Totten, Darian Marie",02/28/2019,"Archaeological Institute of America, Western Illinois Chapter, Knox College (Galesburg, IL)",,,,,"Building Community at Salapia (Apulia, Italy): “Ruins” and their role, then and now"

Most of the genres of Aztec art with carving on their undersides were archaizing, citing the sculptural traditions of cities like Teotihuacan and Tula, which had been abandoned centuries earlier.

15788,HAA-263831-19,"A primary learning outcome in music theory courses is the ability to analyze musical form. To improve undergraduate music education, we have developed a combination of novel data pre-processing and user-directed pattern finding that make it possible to reach the full potential of Martin Wattenberg's 2001 vision for seeing the ""Shape of Song"" (http://www.bewitched.com/song.html). Through the ATAVizM course module, students create compelling visualizations to accompany their analytical papers, but more importantly they learn how analytical processes may be implemented as algorithms.  Musical themes and motives are often transposed or otherwise modified in the course of a piece. An example is the subject and answer of a fugue (an imitative polyphonic composition). How do we formalize the relationship between a subject and tonal answer? Or, the improvisational ""licks"" of Dizzy Gillespie? Such that we could define ""themes"" as a category that may be formalized computationally? Especially, when a computer does not know where to look for themes or what modifications to expect?

15800,RA-228605-15,"In social histories of the Middle East, coffee and tea houses long constituted focal points in both artistic representation and  scholarly research.  These were not the only spaces of congregation  and interaction, however, just as caffeinated beverages were not the only drinks on tap. Often located in the more cosmopolitan  quarters of port cities, the tavern was also a vital site in the urban landscapes of Ottoman society. Featuring not only alcohol, many of these establishments also provided their patrons with food and with access to entertainment, recreation, and opportunities for fraternization with fellow citizens.  The tavern served not only as a locus for social gathering and drinking but it also served the state and its officials as a target for levying taxes and rent seeking, policing the empire's subjects and visitors, and enforcing regulation and/or prohibition. Dr. Evered's research draws on a broad range of primary sources to interrogate the place, purpose, and pertinence of the tavern in Ottoman cities.  It also informs and serves as a corrective to ongoing narrative manipulations of the country's diverse histories and traditions.",Emine Evered,01/18/2019,"Michigan State University, Global Urban Studies Program",https://gusp.msu.edu/ assets/pdfs/Tavern as Site and Spectacle in late Ottoman Urban Life1.pdf,Lecture announcement and abstract,https://gusp.msu.edu/events/GUSP-Colloquium-01-18-2019.html,Event announcement,Tavern as Site and Spectacle in late Ottoman Urban Life
15801,RA-228605-15,"The treasury of the Studenica Monastery in southern Serbia preserves the only known Ottoman textile attributed to the fourteenth century, a massive silk hanging woven for Sultan Bayezid I. It was donated to the monastery in the very early 1400s by Bayezid's widow, Mileva Olivera Lazarevic (Despina Hatun). The textile's two inscriptions—al-Sultan al-calim al-cadil and Sultan Bayezid Khan cazza nasruhu—suggest it was commissioned for the Sultan himself. This talk argues, however, that the manner in which the inscriptions relate to the textile as a whole is at odds with their ostensible message. Rather than a custom design, this silk was probably a rush-job from a workshop accustomed to making goods for a commercial market. This talk introduces the textile, which has received little scholarly attention to date, putting its main features in context of its production as well as discussing its place at Studenica. It also argues for the importance of looking beyond text and evaluating evidence found in objects themselves.",Amanda Phillips,10/9/2019,Orient-Institut Istanbul,https://www.oiist.org/events/prof-amanda-phillips/,Event announcement and abstract,,,"An Ottoman Tiraz?

16047,FEL-257634-18,"An important conclusion of my recent research into the architecture of the temple of Hera at Olympia is that its stone colonnades are largely original to the building, and not, as formerly believed, the result of piecemeal repairs to an older wooden colonnade. The stone columns, as originals from the first quarter of the sixth century BCE, reveal a wide array of construction techniques that are only attested in distant places such as Aigina and Syracuse, as if expert masons had traveled to Olympia and collaborated on the construction of the Heraion. This case can be added to the extensive evidence for itinerant artisans and architects who were active elsewhere in Olympia during the seventh and sixth centuries BCE.  In this talk, I will review the archaeological evidence for inter-regional exchanges at Olympia and discuss why the sanctuary was such an important locus for the formation of archaic Greek art. The sanctuary seems to have balanced two contradictory forces in the development of archaic art: a universalizing push toward idealized forms of art and architecture that were rapidly disseminated throughout the Greek world, and a simultaneous expression of individual identity through the deliberate rejection of the pan-Hellenic norms in favor of regional ones. Archaeologists have tended to explain regionalism through what we know of the political history of Olympia in the early Archaic period—especially in terms of the conflicts among Elis, Pisatis, and Sparta—while downplaying the evidence for more complex interactions among individuals and groups from many other Greek centers. I will make the case that the quadrennial gatherings at the site by aristocrats from throughout the Greek world, and the general context of pan-Hellenic athletic competition, must have profoundly shaped and mediated the sorts of artistic and technical exchanges that connected Olympia to the Peloponnesian and western colonial Greek worlds.",Philip Sapirstein,7-11-2018,"Ancient Olympia, Greece: the 2018 IOA-CHS Symposium, Athla for the People: Democracy, Empire, and the Power of Athletics",,,,,Traveling athletes and artisans in archaic Olympia

Together we pursued a professional development opportunity to explore cross-disciplinary investigations of affect. We engage new areas of research not by building bridges to each other's areas of expertise but by working together from the ground up to create unique foundations of knowledge. This process is full of curiosity, awe, and discovery. In this talk we tell the story of how we came together, what we have been working on, why it matters, and where we are headed.

How can an integrative and ethical framing bring the humanities within reach of vulnerable populations? How can integrative approaches to humanities programs benefit general education, benefit graduate students? How might modern language study contribute to integration?

Attributed to this object -- a plain cotton seed bag -- is a mysterious and dramatic history. The sack was bestowed as a gift by an enslaved black mother to her enslaved black daughter at the time of their separation through sale in antebellum South Carolina.  Embroidered with the narrative of this event by a descendant who inherited the item, the bag now functions as a record of slavery and story of family survival.  Ashley's Sack is at once a material object, archival source, and narrative text that sheds new light on black women's creativity, practicality, and perseverance. In addition, the object's use and transferal across time and place inspires reflection on the themes of slavery, love, loss, memory, testimony, and historical methods.

Japanese experimental farms began disseminating alien grasses and hybrid animals from Australia and North America whose intensive care demanded sedentary patterns of livelihood, undercutting nomadic practice over time.

Scholars have puzzled over this large pre-planned city apparently built and occupied by the Phrygians, of King Midas fame, for a brief period of time between the fall of the Assyrian Empire and rise of the Persian Empire around 550 BC. Over the past twenty-seven years, the site has been a showcase of new technologies being used alongside active excavation, useful in reconstructing the plan of the buried city and the activities and interactions of the people who inhabited it. Together, the latest excavations and technologies are shedding new light on what transpired in this ancient city in the years prior to its fiery destruction.",Scott Branting,11/16/19,"Jasksonville Archaeological Institute of America Chapter (Jacksonville, Florida)",,,,,The Rise and Fall of Kerkenes: New Technologies for Exploring Ancient Cities

It was now possible to think beyond the ""inhabited world"" known since Antiquity and to consider the earth in global terms, which is to say as a geometric object viewable from more than one side. The other side of the earth, where the New World formed the nearest part of an extended Asia, was now relayed to Europeans through a series of mediated images, almost immediately becoming a mirror for the European imagination. By considering several works of European sixteenth century art and literature, Alexander Nagel explores the dynamic reconfiguration of the world at a time when the imagination of globality was being framed explicitly as a problem of point of view, a problem that directly concerned practices of image-making and image-viewing.",Alexander Nagel,10/16/2018,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://architecture.mit.edu/history-theory-and-criticism/lecture/through-slant-night-other-side-earth-sixteenth-century,,,,Through the Slant of Night: The Other Side of the Earth in the Sixteenth Century

This talk explores how the newly discovered lands in Asia and America both delivered the shock of the new. Even the term ""new world"" was not a monopoly of America; the formulas mundus novus and novus orbis were also used to describe the lands reached by the Portuguese in Asia. Most importantly, the new realms discovered to the East and to the West were understood to be convergent. Using an abundance of sources from different media, our presentation explores the ways in which the idea of the New World was entirely compatible, for an extended period, with the idea that the newly discovered lands were part of Asia or bordered Asia.

16599,HAA-263773-19,"This session reports on the progress of a working group that has drawn both feedback and members from NDEO 2017 and 2018.  Previous attendees made it clear that while digital video has made recording dance easier, high-quality, well-curated collections of full-length dance works are not available online and dance scholars and educators face significant geographical and financial barriers to access. In December 2018, the working group was awarded an NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant to fund a symposium at the University of Alabama, during which the group will design a pilot resource and draft a whitepaper. With the symposium scheduled for May 2019, we now propose to report to NDEO stakeholders on this new phase of the project and we seek feedback and involvement from NDEO members to help make the resource a reality.    Communication is central to our panel topic and to the mission of our project. Vibrant, dynamic, and accessible digital sharing of dance will open the door to an exchange of ideas both within the dance community and with audiences. It will also enrich the creative process, allowing educators to move beyond existing streaming dance video platforms that show only a minute or two of a 20- to 50-minute dance. These excerpts serve as publicity tools, but leave educators from primary grades to universities bereft: limited to teaching the equivalent of half a painting, the first minutes of a piece of music, or truncated sentences from a book. Access to full-length dance works will assist educators in teaching form and will allow dance-makers to convey a complete artistic gesture. Also integral to our project is an examination of how design and curation panels can balance thoughtful curation with inclusivity and open-access, broadening available resources beyond the Eurocentric dance to which existing online resources skew.",Rebecca Salzer,10/24/2019,"Miami, FL",https://www.ndeo.org/content.aspx?page id=22&amp;club id=893257&amp;module id=316310,,,,National Dance Education Organization Conference - Dancing Digital:  A Future Online Video Resource

We'll explore our local news history, starting with On Cue, a program aired on the first anniversary of KIRO-TV's inaugural broadcast on February 12, 1959. This ""day in the life"" of local television news is part of the KIRO-TV Special Programs videotape collection held by the UW Libraries, Special Collections. Following that, we'll share historical broadcast pieces from our participating institutions, including MOHAI, the Seattle Art Museum, Seattle Municipal Archives, the Wing Luke Museum and many more.  In an age when we are bombarded with multiple news stories and sources on a daily basis, it is important to reflect on our media history. Before Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, the Seattle area relied on KING, KIRO, KOMO, KCTS, and the Seattle Channel for their local television news. How we documented and described ourselves through broadcast reporting was (and continues to be) an essential part of how we formed our identity as a city and a community.  Television news has been called the first draft of history, but archival collections of local news broadcasts are scarce. Worldwide, more than 30 million hours of unique television programming are broadcast every year, yet only a tiny fraction of it is preserved for future reference, and only a fraction of that material is publicly accessible. Most television broadcasts are simply lost forever, though television archivists have been working diligently to preserve this important resource.  Television remains the most powerful medium in our culture, but we have almost no memory of it: broadcasts are ephemeral, and therefore difficult to analyze, fact-check, and evaluate. Publicly accessible television archives could transform television into a medium with a permanent history that is searchable, accessible, and therefore accountable.

How different was he, the future king, from other individuals born in the same place and time?  The bioarchaeological study of the skeletal remains of non-elite individuals from the ancient Egyptian city of Akhetaten strives to answer this, and other questions, about the lives of the non-elites in Egypt during the Amarna Period (c. 1350BCE), a short 15-20 year period of possible upheaval during which the Pharaoh Akhenaten shifted the focus of the state religion from a pantheon of gods to a single solar deity, the Aten.  Akhenaten's new capital city, built to venerate the Aten in a place no other god had previously been worshiped was a thriving metropolis of 50,000 people.  The remains of this city represent the single best preserved site in Egypt that includes both settlement areas and cemeteries, allowing integration of multiple lines of evidence to understand more fully the lives of the non-elite, outside of the lens of written sources, which were often skewed toward the viewpoints and needs of the elites and royals.","Dabbs, Gretchen R",02/27/2020,"Science Center of Southern Illinois (Carbondale, IL)",https://sciencecentersi.com/science-cafe/,URL for the Southern Illinois Science Center showing Science Cafe Lecture,,,The Lost Cemeteries of Tell el-Amarna: non-elite life at the birthplace of King Tut

This talk explains the development of non-invasive methods, showing results from restoration projects on Homeric manuscripts, Herculaneum material, and Dead Sea scrolls.

16742,PE-263509-19,"The name La Pietra derives from a stone pillar indicating the Roman mile along Via Bolognese from the Florence city gate of San Gallo. For centuries, Villa La Pietra was home to many prominent Florentine families. In 1903, the Anglo-American Acton family took up residence in the 600 year old estate. When Arthur Acton and his wife Hortense Mitchell settled in La Pietra, they and their two children, Harold and William, became immersed in a society of writers, historians, artists, and art collectors. The Acton's own art collection comprises more than 6,000 objects ranging in date from the Etruscan period to the early 20th Century. Fine art exists alongside household objects, books, textiles, furniture, and souvenirs. A library of 10,000 volumes with many signed first editions, an archive holding thousands of family letters, an important series of historical photographs, Hortense's many Callot Soeurs gowns, and an extensive outdoor sculpture collection are but a few of the many treasures found at the Villa. To perpetuate their legacy, the Actons decided to leave La Pietra to a university with the expertise and vision to care for and benefit from their estate. So it was in 1994 that Sir Harold Acton bequeathed his family's estate to New York University. Over the next two decades and through collaboration with the Villa's Italian administration—inlcuding Francesca Baldry, Collection Manager; Ellyn Toscano, Director; and numerous conservation consultants here in the U.S.—our students assist in the conservation efforts of this revealing palimpsest of an ex-pat family. Tonight, conservation students will present their 2018 spring break and summer work projects at Villa La Pietra, New York University's global campus in Florence.

Our experience with Open Context (http://opencontext.org), an open access data publishing service for archaeology, shows that preserving, communicating, aggregating and reusing digital data all involve significant intellectual challenges and opportunities. While our profession increasingly recognizes these possibilities, we rarely discuss the professional context that shapes the ""datafication"" of our discipline. Our current institutional landscape increasingly demands the commoditization, marketing, and branding of scholarship. However, meaningful digital engagement requires greater professional recognition for the process and ethical conduct of research - rather than rewarding only the efficient production of measurable research outcomes.

In the 3rd century BCE, new associations of musicians, poets, and actors, the Technitai of Dionysus, formed, and quickly became a powerful force at the festivals, negotiating with cities and rulers in the interests of their members. Performers, benefactors, spectators, and the buyers and sellers who crowded festival markets all had something to gain from their participation in these cultural events. This talk concerns the history of the Greek dramatic festivals in Roman Asia Minor, from the second century BCE through the collapse of the festivals in Late Antiquity, exploring the long-lived vitality of the festivals in Asia Minor, the unique evidence that comes from this region, and the social, economic, and political forces which shaped the institutions which supported the performance of drama for so many hundreds of years.",Mali Skotheim,4/14/2019,"Bilkent University, Program in Cultures, Civilizations and Ideas",http://ibef.bilkent.edu.tr/2019/04/10/the-greek-dramatic-festivals-in-roman-asia-minordr-mali-skotheim-neh-fellow-american-research-institute-in-turkey/,"Event announcement, Bilkent University, Ankara",,,The Greek Dramatic Festivals in Roman Asia Minor

I demonstrated several ways in which Abbot Suger invoked the different senses to further the monastic work of commemoration. These included the refurbishment of the church's central liturgical core and the rebuilding of the monks' refectory; the introduction of weekly commemorations for Saint Denis and the Virgin, and the reestablishment of other commemorations for royal benefactors—all tied to Suger's own memory and celebrated with special liturgies and meals; and inscriptions and iconography linking food and music in stone, stained glass, and other liturgical furnishings and objects. Beyond the stunning architectural and visual innovation for which it is known, Suger's church served as a multi-sensory memory palace and as a stage for the miraculous, where monks, abbots, and kings might hope for a place at the heavenly feast.",Tova Leigh-Choate,03/22/2017,University of Texas at Austin,,,,,"Song, Image, Food: The Senses of Memory at Abbot Suger’s Saint-Denis"

At first glance, the Church of Scotland's meticulous records present an image of a rigid structure consistent over time and space that would ideally suit a digital approach. However, our period was one of dramatic shifts and regional diversity. Ecclesiastical policy was hotly debated; parishes were created, dissolved, or united with each other; and ministers' roles changed, from mere exhorter to preacher of God's word.

The theme and subtitle of this well-attended event was ""What did they see that wasn't there?"" for Florida has always been a ""State of Dreams"" for the Europeans who hyped, conquered, exploited, and marveled at it.   At the event, Jerald T. Milanich returned to give a talk entitled ""Women in Spanish Moss Sarongs and Alligators with Ears: Theodore de Bry's Famed 1591 Engravings of Florida Indians."" Milanich pursued and solved ""a 420-year old mystery involving Sit Walter Raleigh, English investors, a dead French artist, a live English artist, the lost Roanoke colony, two French noblemen (one murdered, the other deceased), and ancient Picts from Britain, all played out across two continents.""   Dr. Maurice (""Socky"") O'Sullivan of Rollins College gave a talk titled ""Have You Not Hard of Floryda? Early Spanish, French, Portuguese, English, and Latin Accounts of Florida."" Hype and reality intertwined in the early colonial literatures O'Sullivan discussed; which included the first poem printed in English, published the year Shakespeare was born, ""Have You Not Hard of Floryda?""   Finally, Carol Mahler, seminar participant, archivist and professional storyteller, gave her interpretations of tales from Florida Seminoles and cowhunters. (It has to be said that she was the favorite of the students present.)   In the auditorium lobby, posters from faculty and students showcased their research projects; the Avon Park and Sebring Historical Societies brought their displays, and art instructor Karla Respress and her students demonstrated, by means of a video, their contemporary version of Florida indigenous people's techniques of pottery firing, with examples on display.

17244,AE-256242-17,"The production of medical knowledge and the practice of medicine historically were seen as positivist pursuits in which authoritative figures made objective discoveries and applied them dispassionately to their patients. This mirrored widespread beliefs about the sciences in general. Increasingly, however, historians have come to understand medicine as a socially-constructed human behavior that is not purely objective in process or experience. In short, a more subjective view.  In a diverse society such as the United States, questions of who produces medical knowledge and to whom it is applied yield answers as myriad as the complex demography of America itself. And, is medicine something that only ""comes from"" a doctor, or is it something that is practiced in the home by patients and their family members? In this lecture, we'll explore how the production of, attitudes about, and outcomes from medicine have changed over time.","R.A.

This examination of the fights that led to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment explores how suffragists pioneered one of the first extensive visual campaigns in modern American history. Prof. Allison Lange shows how pictures, from early engravings and photographs to colorful posters, proved central to suffragists' efforts to change expectations for women, fighting back against the accepted norms of their times.

18365,FA-251630-17,"Sufisms in North Africa are both esoteric and exoteric; that is, they harbor hidden forms of knowledge and experience known only to initiates but perform them regularly in rituals that are public or semi-public, making them accessible to all. When musics of these rituals are brought onto the concert stage, then, they pose analytical challenges to binaries such as spectatorship/participation, loss/renewal, and authenticity/inauthenticity. In Tunisia, the staging of Sufi music has been monopolized for decades by a staged spectacle called el-Hadhra, which, along with its offshoots and competitors, proceeds according to a modular logic of culture in which music, dance, trance, and other aspects of ritual are approached as separable, extractable, and available for recombination in a plug-and-play manner. This paper unpacks the implications of this logic of modularity through a close reading of el-Hadhra that focuses on strategies of minimizing and maximizing the ‘contextual gap' between ritual and stage performances. The resulting ambiguities, I argue, are inextricable from changing social, religious, and political chains of value ascribed to Sufism over the past century.",Richard Jankowsky,1/24/2017,"Global South Studies Center, University of Cologne, Germany",,,,,"Minding the Contextual Gap: Sufism, the Stage, and the Ambiguities of Modular Culture"

Uplifting each others' lives and honing their craft, they were central to an explosion of 1970s and 1980s literature that included for colored girls who have considered a suicide when the rainbow is enuf. On social media, the photo of these future literary legends, including Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, June Jordan, Patricia Spears Jones, Margo Jefferson, and Ntozake Shange, among many others, is iconic. Join our invited writers for a discussion of Shange's place in the Sisterhood and other collectives. Where does literary organizing fit into histories of Black feminist activism?

The protagonist of the project is a well-known Byzantine micromosaic icon of Christ the Man of Sorrows, enshrined since ca. 1400 at the Basilica di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome. Crafted from nearly 50,000 minute pieces of glass, metal, marble, and stone, the icon is among the most meticulous depictions of the human body in medieval art. The story of this icon, which journeyed from Constantinople to Rome via the Kingdom of Naples and other Mediterranean ports-of-call, affords new insight into the metaphorical meaning of Christ's broken body in both Orthodox and Latin/Catholic ritual contexts at a critical juncture in the political conflict between the divided Churches of East and West. Enshrined in Rome in an extraordinary triptych reliquary cabinet and ensconced by relics representing all corners of medieval Christendom, the icon became the centerpiece to a grand microcosm of the Christian oecumene: ""the known world.""

However, from the outset vaccination met with serious opposition as it challenged race and gender hierarchies, provoked anxieties about outside invention in children's health, and rejected the cultural belief that mothers could effectively care for their own children. In Peru, mothers called the primary vaccinator ""the AntiChrist"" and fled to the mountains rather than vaccinate their children, and in central Mexico, indigenous mothers brought their children to be vaccinated but then asked for the ""poison"" to be removed.

18979,FT-270715-20,"The historical study of women's lives often requires the piecing together of disparate and partial evidence mined from archives. Happily, archives are now being put online, which both removes barriers to access and offers powerful new approaches to searching and visualizing content. This presentation will introduce the audience to the project of publishing online the correspondence of 17th-century Italian-French noblewoman Marie Mancini, with a dual focus on the content of the letters and on the creation of the website for their publication.   Marie Mancini (1639-1715) was famous as the first love of Louis XIV of France, and later she and her sister Hortense became scandalous celebrities by running away from their husbands and traveling unaccompanied through much of Western Europe. Though she steadfastly refused to return to her husband in Rome, Marie carried on a regular correspondence with him, and her letters are held in the Colonna family archive, which resides in the library of the Benedictine monastery of Santa Scolastica in Subiaco, Italy. Her husband Lorenzo Colonna's letters to her have been lost due to the circumstances of her itinerant life, and so what we have is a one-sided conversation through which to attempt a reconstruction of the chess match between Marie and Lorenzo, and its intersection with the broader concerns of international diplomacy.  Project leader Sarah Nelson and assistant Alessandro Martina will discuss the discoveries and remaining mysteries in the letters they have so far transcribed and translated. Library faculty member Olivia Wikle and research assistant Liam Marchant will discuss the choices and challenges involved in the creation of the project website, with a demonstration of the tools that allow varying chronological and spatial visualizations of the material.","Alessandro Martina, Sarah Nelson, Olivia Wikle, Liam Marchant",10/6/2020,"University of Idaho (remotely delivered talk, due to COVID-19 pandemic)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Vf05 qSY4,"Recording of the October 6, 2020, presentation as part of the Malcolm Renfrew Interdisciplinary Colloquium at the University of Idaho.

19411,PW-264060-19,"Since 1994 ARCE has maintained an archive of 78 conservation and documentation projects funded by USAID. The archive comprises important collections of images, reports, and drawings documenting the conservation process for Egyptian cultural heritage sites spanning virtually all of the country's historical and cultural eras. Until 2016, original data and the majority of ARCE archival holdings remained inaccessible to anyone unable to visit ARCE's office in Cairo.  In 2016, ARCE and the UCLA Library partnered to launch two ARCE archival collections on UCLA's Digital Library platform, the International Digital Ephemera Project (IDEP). The successful processing and publication of ARCE's first archival digital collection, in parallel with the knowledge acquired by ARCE staff through this partnership, inspired the organization to seek further funding opportunities to continue digitization and publication of the invaluable Conservation Archives.  In 2019, ARCE won an award from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to lay the foundations for digitizing and publishing more collections, including a processing manual and foundational archival policies. The Archives team digitized and published three additional collections on ARCE's newly published Conservation Archives website, developed in partnership with the UCLA Digital Library.

In this online program, professors Elizabeth Emery and Chelsea Foxwell will consider the persistent influence of the western construct of Japonisme and the new aesthetic forms it inspired.  In 1872, French art critic Philippe Burty coined the term ""Japonisme"" to refer to the growing western admiration for ""all things Japanese."" European and American enthusiasm for Japanese exports led, however, to the creation of entirely new categories of Japanese ""art"" than those recognized in Japan. Elizabeth Emery, author of Reframing Japonisme: Women and the Asian Art Market in Nineteenth-Century France, 1853–1914 (Bloomsbury, 2020), will reassess the conceptual framework of Japonisme to ask: who has the right to create new aesthetic categories? Who and what do such classifications exclude? How have temporally specific cultural preferences shaped entire fields of study?  Professor Emery's presentation will be followed by a response from Chelsea Foxwell, a specialist in modern Japanese-style (Nihonga) painting, and a moderated conversation with curator Rachel Saunders.","Chelsea Foxwell, Rachel Saunders, Elizabeth Emery",06/08/2021,Harvard Art Museums/Zoom,https://harvardartmuseums.org/calendar/reframing-japonisme-painting-edo-and-beyond,,,,Reframing Japonisme: Painting Edo and Beyond

BCE. The siting of this new settlement along a lagoon was fortuitous: protected by dunes from the battering Adriatic Sea, it was afforded a natural harbor that offered the inhabitants a link to wider Mediterranean networks. This lagoon, at present, is one of the top sea salt producers in the whole Mediterranean Basin, and its medieval and early modern history is marked by evidence of coordinated curation and extraction of this resource; sparser ancient evidence points perhaps to similar circumstances in the Roman and Late Antique periods. The port and its salty resources would have impelled Salapia to connect to the outside world in intriguing and significant ways. A review of the imported ceramic wares -finewares and amphorae -over these centuries makes apparent not just into what networks Salapia was integrated but also the intensity of those connections. It is possible that Salapia was a clearinghouse and node for transport of Mediterranean products to the interior of the province of Apulia. For instance, even as the Roman empire was largely defunct by the 7th c. CE, and the town plan had unraveled, African finewares -albeit in reduced numbers -still made it into the hands of the town's inhabitants, perhaps a residue of connections that were more apparent and strong in earlier centuries. Analyses of features from the urban plan also give us a more comprehensive picture of the local economy at Salapia.","Totten, Darian Marie",04/11/2021,"Archaeological Institute of America, Milwaukee Society",,,,,"The ancient economies of a small port on the Adriatic: the case of Salapia (Puglia, Italy) from the 1st-8th c.

As a result of NATO's intervention, however, most Kosovars were able to return to their homes by the end of August 1999.

19729,FEL-268510-20,"The conquest of ""Nepal"" (i.e., the Newar-ruled Kathmandu valley) during 1767–68 by the Gorkha king Prithvinarayan Saha (PNS) has been described as ushering in a period of major social changes and political realignments as power came to be concentrated in Gorkhali hands, to the detriment of the Newar kings of the three cities.  With support from ""Tibeto-Nepali"" ethnic groups of the lower hills, PNS captured Nuwakot in 1744 and Kantipur (Kathmandu) in 1768.  New and expanding regimes often seek to legitimize themselves by embracing what they take to be a compelling ideology of law and religion, one that sets the ruler up as law-giver or reformer.  In South and Southeast Asia, this has usually involved the embrace and adaptation of sacred law, especially framed as Brahmanical Dharma.  The Gorkhali regime adopted such a program (a) to participate in a prestigious Indian cosmpolitanism imprinted with Brahmanical religious ideals of piety and kingship; and (b) to provide a template for intergroup relations in a culturally, linguistically, and religiously diverse realm.  This paper begins with an analysis of the ideological features of the ""Divya Upadesa"" (a compilation of what purports to be PNS's memoirs and instructions, preserved in a manuscript of ca. 1800 that alludes to earlier royal law-givers) and then examines a number of royal decrees preserved as copper-plate inscriptions or documents (lal mohar) issued by PNS and subsequent Gorkhali kings prior to the Rana coup.  These provide indications of how the Gorkhali regime dealt with various social groups as they consolidated their governance.  These documents provide glimpses into how top-down attempts at putting a ""sacred law"" ideology into practice actually proceeded, responsive to the diverse interests and agency of the subject groups themselves.",Timothy Lubin,02/26/2021,"Conference on ""Inqilab: Revolution, Rebellion, and Re-alignments in Eighteenth-Century South Asia,"" Conference hosted by the Davis Center, Department of History, Princeton University (via Zoom)",https://inqilabconf.princeton.edu/,"Website of the conference: Inqilab: Revolution, Rebellion, and Realignments in Eighteenth-Century South Asia, the 2021 Davis Center Annual Conference, hosted by the Department of History,  Princeton University.",,,Sacred Law as a Device of State-Building: The Case of Gorkhali Rule in Nepal
19730,FEL-268510-20,"Archives in Java and Bali (not to mention in Europe) contain manuscripts of a number of texts in Old Javanese (sometimes mixed with Sanskrit verses) detailing legal ""causes of action,"" using the Sanskrit rubric vyavahara[pada] or astadasa-vyavahara as it appears in the Sanskrit Dharmasastra literature. Apart from the work conventionally but misleadingly known as the ‘Kutara Manava', which has been published twice (Jonker's Wetboek, 1885; Hoadley &amp; Hooker's Agama, 1981), in each case relying on a single manuscript, most of these have received little or no scholarly attention. Early results of my own study of these texts, however, suggest that they reflect a creative appropriation of Indic legal science as a framework for codifying indigenous Indonesian legal norms. This included a practice of formally defining criminal and civil wrongs in a casuistic manner used also for defining Sanskrit terms of legal art. Some of the Javanese expressions are more like maxims than mere titles, and can be rather colorful. Besides the Javanese terms of art, it is notable that a number of fixed expressions used in these works, mostly numbered sets (astadusta, astacora, pañcabhaya, pañcasadhara?a), have no precedent in Sanskrit sources from India and appear to derive from Sanskrit works composed in Indonesia (or at least surviving only there). Thorough study of this literature also promises to clarify a number of legal features appearing in Indonesian inscriptions, including the formulaic lists of sukhaduhkha (wrongs subject to legal penalties, over which beneficiaries of religious endowments have authority), including this use of the term sukhaduhkha itself.",Timothy Lubin,03/14/2021,231st Annual Meeting of the American Oriental Society (via Zoom),https://www.americanorientalsociety.org/annual-meeting/past-and-future-annual-meetings/,Past and Future Annual Meetings of the American Oriental Society,,,Javanese Innovations in Indic Legal Science
19731,FEL-268510-20,"In considering how the comparative history of ancient law expands our understanding of what law is and who makes it, three axioms apply: (1) Our access to ancient law, like ancient anything, is fragmentary and lopsided in the extreme. (2) Elite viewpoints are even more overrepresented than in later eras, obscuring the role of non-elite actors. (3) Systematic attention to hearing to ""what the authors didn't mean to say"" (D. Davis) about themselves and about non-elite or subaltern groups requires us to make the most of surviving documents as well as materials that are not strictly speaking legal.  Extending the horizon of ""ancient law"" beyond Greece and Rome brings three factors to light: (1) The formal legal definition of ""citizen"" status turns out to be a peculiarity of Greece and Rome. (2) One encounters an extraordinary range of unfree statuses liable to be called ""slave"" in English, and racial or ethnic otherness is much less a factor in some systems. (3) Comprehensive systems of religious law that transcend the boundaries of particular states and that vest authority in religious experts have been neglected in earlier studies of ancient law, and of law in general, but bear comparison with other systems of ""customary law"" and ""international law.""",Timothy Lubin,03/28/2021,"Workshop on Decolonising Archives, Rethinking Canons: Writing Intellectual Histories of Global Entanglements, Faculty of History, University of Cambridge (via Zoom).",https://sites.google.com/view/darcworkshop/home,"Website of the workshop on ""Decolonising Archives, Rethinking Canons: Writing Intellectual Histories of Global Entanglements,"" Faculty of History, University of Cambridge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhg Z ShM2A,Videorecording of the roundtable session.,Roundtable presentation on Intellectual Histories of Law

The Brahmins' response to this encounter was to adapt and appropriate new ideas and practices. Here, I clarify certain key aspects of how this adaptation proceeded, giving rise in fact to something one can call ‘Brahmanism', and I offer a fuller explanation of what made that adaptation so successful and durable over time. The key factors I identify are these: •Confronted by new sets of religious ideals (models of dharma) taught by unworldly ascetics (srama?as), some Brahmins decided to compete by articulating one of their own.  •Brahmin ritual authorities further sought to signal their status as religious professionals comparable to celibate mendicants by promoting the ritualized feeding of especially pious and/or learned Brahmins. •This systematic conflation of Brahminhood as a sacred profession and Brahminhood as a social status conferred by birth provided a rationale and a template for marking gradations of hierarchy and thus endowed Indian caste norms with a theological purpose and a social teleology—i.e., presenting those norms as part of a system. •This was institutionalized and given state sanction by rulers who endowed Brahmins with tax-exempt, partly autonomous foundations, and patronized Brahmanical expertise in various ritual as well ""secular"" matters.  These factors are what made the Indian version of caste social structure distinctive and tenacious — what made it a ‘system' with religious principles as their premises rather than merely as ex post facto justifications.",Timothy Lubin,05/06/2021,"Symposium, “Greater Magadha: Evaluation and Retrospective,” Department of History and Classics, University of Alberta (via Zoom)",https://www.eventleaf.com/GreaterMagadha,"Website of the symposium, “Greater Magadha: Evaluation and Retrospective,” Department of History and Classics, University of Alberta.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thruROmOtR8&amp;t=4412s,Videorecording of the lecture.,"Brahmins, Ascetics, and the Constitution of Caste in Greater Magadha"

In the course of reconciling the legality of the king's court with Veda-based, otherworldly considerations such as sin and expiation, these passages show that punishments and penances constitute distinct forms of legal remedy serving different purposes and prescribed by different authorities; the case of the ""wise thief"" is but the contrived exception that proves the rule. This issue is shown to reflect the more thorough-going distinction between worldly obligations (social compacts, royal commands) and sacred obligations conveyed by Vedic injunctions.

19736,FEL-268510-20,"Endowment grants beginning in the early centuries CE conferred upon religious professionals (Buddhist, Jain, Brahmin) exemption from tax-payments and other obligations to the king, along with stipulated rights of internal legal self-governance.  Similar grants of foundation appeared more widely in South and Southeast Asia throughout the following millennium, embodying regional variations on a general principle that religious institutions have a justifiable claim to be insulated from the fiscal regime of the state, even if they participate in the economy in other ways, not least by contributing to the welfare of the polity that supports them financially.  Such support is an intangible asset of the state, one even quantified as proportionate to the tax revenue foregone.  This status was also deemed to confer jural autonomy over the territory covered by the grant.  Grants of this type implied that there was a sacral sphere of authority conceptually distinguishable from worldly affairs, however intertwined they were.  Civil religion in ancient India and Java, then as today, was a balancing act of signaling the distinctness of religion (i.e., its transcendence) while implicating it in the public or private welfare of the patron (i.e., its immanence).",Timothy Lubin,10/01/2021,"History Division at the School of Humanities at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (via Zoom).",https://www.ntu.edu.sg/soh/news-events/events/detail/2021/10/01/research-events/religious-exemptions-and-jural-autonomy-in-foundation-grants-of-early-india-and-java,Webpage announcement of the lecture at NTU.,,,Religious Exemptions and Jural Autonomy in Foundation Grants of Early India and Java
19759,HAA-261271-18,"In this paper we present the latest work on large scale, semi-automatic and quantitative analysis of the body of entities mentioned in texts from Coptic Antiquity. Unlike Greek and Roman materials, which have been studied extensively, digital treatment of Coptic data from the first millennium has lagged behind until recently, in part due to the smaller research community and the morphological complexity of the language, which is fusional and features agglutination, compounding and incorporation of nouns into complex verbs.  We will show how annotating named and non-named entities enriches Coptic corpora, including the identification of nested entities and entity linking. We will focus especially on non-named Coptic entities, which are of great interest to scholars working on monasticism and asceticism, since many central texts revolve around unnamed protagonists (e.g. ‘an ascetic') in unidentified locations (‘a monastery'). In many cases, the proportion of named entities is well below 5%.  The relevance of entity annotation is further demonstrated through visualizations of Coptic entities, which enable researchers to access a variety of information in Coptic corpora through distant reading, allowing them to explore easily types of places in different works, to get lists of nouns referring to organizations, events or animals, examine feminine vs. masculine nouns denoting people and more. From a comparative quantitative perspective, the prevalence of non-named entities of different types can also reveal dissimilarities between texts. Figure 2 juxtaposes the ranked ratio of mentions for people vs. places, illustrating which works focus on human behavior than on descriptions of environmental settings.","Amir Zeldes, Caroline T.

19767,FZ-266853-19,"Amidst the Greek-inspired pedimental groups of the Capitol, National Archives, and Supreme Court Building and the honorific portraits of Jefferson, Lincoln, and numerous equestrian generals, the statuary program of Union Station stands out in the sculptural landscape of Washington, DC—in subject matter as well as placement.  This lecture explores the Roman models and American messages of Louis St. Gaudens' six allegorical figures that grace the attic of Union Station's façade (""The Progress of Railroading"") as well as his forty six ""Centurions"" who guard the building's interior. To date, these statues have been neglected in scholarship, perhaps because they were created by the less famous brother of the acclaimed Gilded Age American sculptor, Augustus Saint Gaudens. The lecture presents new archival research demonstrating that, though the Union Station sculptures were completed in 1913, the placement of all and the subjects of some were inspired by Trajan's second century CE Dacian Prisoners, reused on the Arch of Constantine. This study also provides insight into the adoption and adaptation of other Classical models, the sculptor's process of creating the Classicizing statuary, and the collaboration between Louis St. Gaudens and the building's architect, Daniel H. Burnham, famed as the director of works at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and the chairman of the committee that conceived and executed the MacMillan Plan for which Washington's 1907 Union Station served as a linchpin. Finally, the lecture seeks to show that the placement and subjects of the architectural sculpture of Union Station, rare among contemporary American train depots, was purposive and learned—and designed to echo its European counterparts. Furthermore, this adoption of the Roman profusion of three-dimensional sculptures in architectural facades contributed to making America's capital ""a city of statues,"" much like ancient Rome itself.",Elise A.

19828,FT-270555-20,"The Puerto Rico Planning Board (PRPB) was established in 1942 by the last North American governor of colonial Puerto Rico, Rexford Guy Tugwell, and fellow white planners and consultants from the United States. The PRPB envisioned and planned the transformation of the colony's capital, San Juan, into a modern, industrial, and post-tropical city attractive for U.S. industrial capital. A city planned for capital and not humans came about. In this paper, I engage with Frantz Fanon's psychiatric and radical humanist work to help us rethink the history of urban planning in Puerto Rico and the United States. Drawing on Fanon, I maintain that urban planning must, above all else, ""institute a general framework for de-alienating encounters"". Against this Fanonian principle, I evaluate the PRPB's imperial design of San Juan during its first two decades of existence. Based on archival research, the paper documents the PRPB's slum clearance program from 1945 to 1955, a vast urban and carceral operation that displaced and re-placed thousands of Black families in the name of capital. In effect, the program, tested first in San Juan and later emulated across the U.S., ran counter to Fanon's planning principle, instituting instead the framework for urban alienation by designing a white supremacist city by and for imperial capital. With this intervention I wish to accomplish two goals: (1) center Puerto Rico in the cartographies of Black Geographies; and (2) engage with Fanon to help us theorize dehumanizing and racist planning and design in settler colonial and postcolonial cities.",Joaquin Villanueva,11/5/21,Indiana University,,,,,"Urban Planning with Fanon: The Puerto Rico Planning Board and Alienation in San Juan, 1942-1955."

20054,HAA-271747-20,"Processing and analyzing historical manuscripts is considered one of the most challenging problems in the document analysis and recognition domain. Manuscripts written in cursive are even more difficult due to overlapping words with random spacing, irregular and varying characters' shapes, poor scan quality, and insufficient labeled data. Despite the significant achievements of deep learning approaches in computer vision, handwritten word recognition is far from solved. Most of the existing methods focus on well-segmented word datasets. In this paper, we present an empirical study investigating how well state-of-the-art deep learning models perform on detection and recognition of handwritten words in Spanish American notary records. Professional historians were involved in preparing a labeled dataset of 26,482 Spanish words employed in the experiments. We investigate the performance of some state-of-the-art models on optical character recognition (OCR) in handwritten text documents: Keras-OCR, the object detection algorithm ""You Only Look Once"" (YOLO), Tesseract OCR, Kraken, and Calamari-OCR. Since YOLO does not include a text recognizer, we propose YOLO-OCR, an innovative model to detect and recognize words in historical manuscripts written in Spanish. Our results show the performance of pre-trained models on our dataset and that Keras-OCR and YOLO-OCR models are highly valuable for content extraction.","Nouf Alrasheed, Shivika Prasanna, Ryan Rowland, Praveen Rao, Viviana Grieco, Martin Wasserman",10/20/2021,"Chengdu, China",https://sumac-workshops.github.io/2021/,,,,Evaluation of Deep Learning Techniques for Content Extraction in Spanish Colonial Notary Records

20270,FEL-273171-21,"Archaeology in the Middle East has involved, for more than 200 years, foreign-led excavations hiring teams of site workers from the local communities in the region. These locally-hired laborers have carried out the bulk of the shoveling, sifting, and dirt-hauling for most of the archaeological work in the region, but rarely appear in publications or even excavation archives. Their expertise and their perspectives on Middle Eastern archaeology have largely disappeared. But through a combination of ethnographic work, social network analysis, and emancipatory photography, I present some ways of seeing the often-invisible knowledge that local laborers possess about the archaeological work which has relied on them for so long. These strategies also suggest how we might adjust our excavation methods to be more inclusive, and therefore more produce a more accurate and thorough archaeological record.",Allison Mickel,10/08/2021,"Williamsburg, Virginia",,,,,"The Invisible Experts of Middle Eastern Archaeology: In Stories, Networks, and Visions"

Teika wrote over four thousand waka poems in his lifetime, some of which are regarded today as the very best in this distinguished canon.  Through his diary, Meigetsuki, and other records, we have a tremendous amount of Teika's activities, lifestyle, and idiosyncratic personality.  Perhaps we know more about Teika than any other individual in classical Japan.  Many samples of his distinctive calligraphy have survived and have been coveted by collectors and practitioners of the tea ceremony for centuries.  In this talk, given in English, Professor Atkins will lead us through a tour of Teika's life, highlighting important events such as the Genpei War of 1180-1185, the Jokyu Disorder of 1221, the places he lived and visited during his lifetime, and Teika's literary activities, including his most highly regarded poems.

In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan.

20391,FT-264551-19,"In 1533, Lady Qu, native prefect of Wuding Prefecture in northern Yunnan, sponsored the inscription of two texts on a cliff face at the center of her domain. One was in Nasu, the language of the ruling lineage; the other was in Chinese. Both commemorated the long, powerful line of Né (or Yi) native chieftains to which Lady Qu was heir. Yet they gave contradictory accounts of the forms of chiefly succession, sources of political authority, and geopolitical position of the native domain. The inscriptions show that chiefly sovereignty was neither merely embodied in ancestral authority nor simply endowed by the emperor. Sovereignty—particularly that of a female chieftain—was the capacity to master both modes of self-description while embodying their incompatibility. While we often understand colonialism through power-laden projects of translation, Lady Qu's inscriptions give evidence that Ming colonization of the southwest might require a different approach. Native chieftains were often intermediaries in encounters between indigenous peoples and imperial agents, garrisoned soldiers, and other migrants. Rather than merely understanding these elites as translators and mediators of colonialism, we might also ask how they emphasized and strategically deployed cultural and linguistic differences to achieve ends of their own.",Erik Mueggler,05/20/2019,"Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Humanities Workshop.

Clergy attempted to prove this theory by removing embryos via caesarean surgery. Because historians of medicine have tended to omit religious sources, they have long overlooked these—surgical—origins of Catholic claims on the unborn. The first chapter offers an first in-depth English-language examination of Joaquín Castellot's translation of Francesco Cangiamila's Embriologia Sacra—a foundational work in embryological (embryo) science, and argues that it has been overlooked in that field due to its religious underpinnings.  Sacred Embryology was the first to insist that Catholic priests should be required to perform cesarean operations on dead and dying women, in order to baptize the infants in their wombs. While others have analyzed the masculinization, medicalization, and racialization of reproductive medicine, this talk suggests that we can also consider Cangiamila's tome figures as a foundational work in the ""spiritualization"" of obstetrics—that is, the reinterpretation of the caesarean operation in the service of Catholic doctrine.","Altina Hoti, Elizabeth O'Brien",02/04/2021,Generation to Reproduction seminar series in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University,https://hopkinshistoryofmedicine.org/2021/02/24/dr-elizabeth-obrien-at-hps-cambridges-generation-to-reproduction-seminar/,,,,"“As Small as a Grain of Barley: The Bourbon State and the Caesarean Operation in New Spain, 1771-1810s,”"

21166,FEL-267473-20,"Recent discussions of animal communication and the evolution of language have advocated adopting a ‘pragmatics-first' approach. On this approach, ""a more productive framework"" for identifying precursors of language in animal communication should be ""pragmatics, the field of linguistics that examines the role of context in shaping the meaning of linguistic utterances"" (Wheeler &amp; Fischer 2012: 203). It is reasonable to expect such an approach to yield a feasible characterization of Protolanguage – a hypothetical stage between animal communication systems as we know them and human natural languages. After distinguishing two different conceptions of pragmatics that advocates of the pragmatics-first approach have implicitly relied on (one Carnapian, the other Gricean), I argue that neither conception is adequate to this task. My main aim in this paper is to motivate – and begin to articulate – an intermediary conception of pragmatics whose scope is narrower than Carnapian pragmatics but broader than Gricean pragmatics. This conception, I argue, would allow us to characterize a stage at which our pre-human ancestors moved significantly beyond the merely coded communication that is often claimed to be characteristic of nonhuman animals' use of communicative signals. This, despite not yet being capable of fully Gricean communication. On the intermediary pragmatics-first approach I advocate, users of Protolanguage would have learned to bring a basic capacity to display to each other – and recognize each other's – states of mind directly to bear on their use of communicative signals. They would have learned to engage in what I describe as psychologically mediated, proto-Gricean communication. Proper understanding of the character of such communication should, I believe, reveal the advantages of Protolanguage over existing animal communication systems. It could also contribute to our understanding of what it would have taken for Protolanguage users to move further in the direc",Dorit Bar-On,9/2/2021,Online; remote presentation to an international audience,,,,,"""Pragmatic Protolanguage""; Keynote"

21342,EH-272497-20,"Among the many legacies of The New Deal's WPA, the Slave Narratives of the Federal Writers' Project hold an unprecedented place in our history. Capturing more than 2,300 first-person accounts of formerly enslaved people that were taken between 1936 and 1938, this collection of life histories, testimonies, and reminiscences constitutes the single most important documentation of a complex and fundamental chapter in America's past. For historians, the significance of this collection is profound. For descendants of formerly enslaved people seeking to fill in stories of their ancestors, it provides dramatic evidence. And for everyone of any racial or ethnic background, these firsthand accounts of American slavery paint a vivid picture of a facet of our history that is otherwise largely erased.  The Center for Brooklyn History hosted panelist Clint Smith, staff writer at The Atlantic and author of the recent, widely acclaimed book How the Word is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America; historian John Edgar Tidwell who has written extensively on Sterling A. Brown, FWP's national editor of Negro Affairs; and historian Catherine Stewart, author of the 2016 book Long Past Slavery: Representing Race in the Federal Writers' Project, for this conversation about the impact and import of the Federal Writers' Project and Its Ex-Slave Narrative Collection. As Congress continues to debate a proposal for a 21st century Federal Writers' Project Act, the panelists explored the urgency of continued efforts to archive the lived experiences and underrepresented stories of our diverse country. The program was moderated by Peabody Award-winning journalist and documentarian Brian Palmer.

21767,RZ-255635-17,"The past several years has produced convincing evidence for Epipaleolithic (or earlier) occupations of some Mediterranean islands. Yet, conventional wisdom was that most islands were only occupied during the Neolithic or later, and were peripheral to regional cultural developments during prehistory. Cyprus has strong evidence for an Epipaleolithic presence, beginning with the occupation of Akrotiri Aetokremnos at ca. 12,000 B.P., and perhaps earlier, bringing it into the forefront of research on Late Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherer and Early Neolithic movements and colonization, as well as their associated technological innovations and impacts on shaping newly settled landscapes. Evidence for Epipalaeolithic occupation of Cyprus remains limited, however, with only a handful of sites known and only one chronometrically dated. Here, I highlight discoveries from 2018 and 2019 survey seasons by the Ancient Seafaring Explorers of Cyprus Project (ASEC), which documented several probable Epipaleolithic sites and compare this to what we know about the Epipalaeolithic on the mainland, especially in Jordan.",Lisa Maher,2/4/2022,"University of Toronto, Canada",,,,,Ancient Hunter-Gatherer Seafaring Explorers of Cyprus: Traversing Land and Sea during the Epipalaeolithic
21768,RZ-255635-17,"Few cultural developments have been as well-studied as when people began living in villages and producing their own food. Yet in Southwest Asia, during the preceding ten thousand years of prehistory, Epipalaeolithic (23,000-11,500 cal BP) hunter-gatherers initiated and experienced dramatic cultural transformations that included building the earliest permanent houses and villages, storing food, developing a rich and diverse artistic repertoire, establishing wide-ranging social networks, intensifying plant use, domesticating animals, and creating strong ties to specific places in the landscape as evidenced by some of the world's earliest aggregation sites and cemeteries. These hunter-gatherer groups had highly complex, knowledgeable and dynamic relationships with their local environments. Ongoing work in Jordan and Cyprus is revising our knowledge of these periods with evidence that markers of social complexity have an earlier foundation and challenging our long-held assumptions about how hunter-gatherers here perceived and constructed spaces and places, and the intersections between them. Investigation of human-environment interactions, the role of technological knowledge in creating social networks, the use of large-scale aggregation sites, and symbolic features of human burials, for example, all support a longer chronology of cultural development and continuity and in situ change among hunter-gatherers here that significantly predates the Neolithic. Indeed, it suggests that the features and practices often considered hallmarks of the Neolithic were enacted within a hunter-gatherer world and worldview.",Lisa Maher,1/24/2022,"Queen's University, Canada",,,,,"Persistent Place-Making in Prehistory: The creation, maintenance and transformation of landscapes in Southwest Asia (and Beyond)."
21804,HAA-269032-20,"The Hopewell (ca. 1 to 400 CE) monumental earthworks were expressions of a brilliant florescence of art, architecture, ceremony, and interregional interaction unparalleled in contemporary North America. ""Hopewell"" societies participated in a sophisticated interaction sphere that likely involved a mixture of gift-giving, pilgrimage offerings, extraordinary journeys by individuals and small groups, and trade. These places of aggregation, celebration, and renewal are now severed from these functions. It is no longer possible to experience and investigate the original forms of these monuments. The barriers of time and space limit various audiences (e.g., tribal citizens, K-12 schools, researchers) from being able to interact with and learn from these earthworks. New digital technologies provide opportunities to overcome these challenges through virtual Hopewellian built environments.  The Newark Earthworks, the preeminent example of Hopewellian geometric earthworks, consists of four large enclosures connected by avenues of parallel walls enveloping more than 3.9 mi2. The complex inscribes intricate knowledge of the celestial ecosystem into the site geometry. Precisely inscribing these alignments on the ground, required extensive planning and exquisite knowledge of the sky's various cycles.

Although Antioch's prominence is famous, a quantitative analysis of coins minted in the city and excavated throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East exposes the gradations of imperial power and local agency mediated within its walls. As imperial governments capitalized upon Antioch's location and amenities, the citizens developed in their own distinct identities and agency – both financial and political.

We then describe the methods for creating accurate transcriptions, and preparing the transcriptions for machine readability, converting the textual relations into numbers, generating statistical profiles, and querying the database of statistics to identify shared text variations within the manuscript clusters.

22883,FEL-272833-21,"Recent anti-Asian hate and resulting activism, in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement, have reignited the possibilities of interracial solidarity. This crucial coalition-building can best be understood through its historical antecedents: the social protest movements of the 1960s and 70s and the call for ethnic studies curricula in the American education system. Emblematic of this call for Asian Americans was a literary anthology, Aiiieeeee! (1974), which insisted on an Asian American voice that went far beyond the stereotypical cry of Asian characters depicted in early American films and comic books that inspired its title.   This webinar will be led by Professor Tara Fickle, who helped to get the anthology reissued in 2019, wrote the new foreword, and is developing an associated digital archive. It will provide educators with grounding to teach Asian American literature, contextualizing major events and themes (such as Japanese American mass incarceration, the racial ""in-between"" position of Asian Americans as model minorities, and the rise of China) that have informed this underappreciated body of literature. Educators will learn to effectively lead students in discussions of a complex racial history, deploy accurate and up-to-date vocabulary, and connect contemporary events on the domestic and international stage to their history.",Tara Fickle,4/1/2023,Webinar,https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/education-programs/webinars/,,,,Teaching Aiiieeeee!

As products of mass conversion movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Dalit Christians lived at the margins of Hindu village life and established Christian traditions, and their theologies critiqued caste oppression within both Hindu and Christian contexts. More recently, Dalits have found in Pentecostalism an alternative source of identity and belonging built around ecstatic worship, relaxed caste barriers, belief in supernatural healing and prophecy, and pastoral services that address the needs of mobile, poor, sick, and marginal peoples. I argue that Pentecostalism, like Dalit theology, de-centers India's ""ideal citizen subject"" - the upper caste, educated Hindu whose claim to cultural hegemony is grounded in a pure, classical heritage. It does so by presenting an alternative ""affective citizenship"" that nurtures a sense of belonging through democratic practices and tangible experiences of community and spirituality.

With the emergence of the #metoo and Time's Up movements, these annual events are under increased scrutiny for contributing to widespread gender inequities within a historically male-dominated industry. This presentation explores the powerful role of festivals as industry gatekeepers through a feminist media industry studies lens. First, I briefly outline common barriers women face in applying to and participating in major North American and European festivals. From historical disparities in acceptance rates for female-driven films to the lack of diversity in attending critics, women filmmakers do not gain access to the same career opportunities and advantages as male peers. Second, although more festivals are committing to gender parity pledges like 5050x2020, how individual festivals address gender inequity still varies widely. I examine two case studies—Cannes and Toronto—and the industrial, cultural, and economic factors impacting how each festival approaches this systemic issue. Even as the Cannes film market witnessed increased sales and distribution deals for female-driven projects, programming for official screenings remains male-dominated. In contrast, Toronto has emerged as an industry leader in equity and inclusion initiatives through female-driven programming, conference panels, and initiatives like Share Her Journey. Based on industry interviews, festival participant observation, and trade press coverage between 2013 and 2018, this presentation offers an on-the-ground look at the developing impact of #metoo and Time's Up on the international film festival business.",Courtney Brannon Donoghue,2/17/2022,University of Texas at Austin,,,,,"Female-Driven Filmmaking, Gendered Value, and the International Festival Marketplace, Global Media Industry Speaker Series"

By focusing upon literary works that were largely serialized in prewar Japanese-language immigrant newspapers published in Brazil and pro-expansionist magazines from Japan proper, I seek to disclose the surprisingly intimate and intersectional discourse regarding what it meant to be Japanese in the world.",Seth Jacobowitz,04/17/2023,Terasaki Center for Japanese Studies at UCLA,https://www.international.ucla.edu/japan/#,,,,The Continuum of Immigration and Imperialism in Prewar Japan

Scalar, a platform for media-rich scholarly publishing, facilitates similar functions and is a tool that all of our polymaths can learn and apply to their own scholarship—in any and all disciplines across the university.  We are limited only by our imagination with the discoveries to be made by the intersection of technologies of the past (ie: paper) with the emerging technologies of today and the future (Multimedia, VR, AR, GIS, AI to name a few).

23749,RZ-255604-17,"The Sicilian Channel between Sicily and North Africa receives global attention as a major migratory route for undocumented people entering Europe clandestinely, a tragic nexus of transnational displacement and desperation. While the plight of massively overloaded and unseaworthy boats of people justifiably receives the bulk of media attention, there is a less-observed movement that occurs and has occurred for thousands of years: small boats expertly transporting handfuls of people back and forth across the Channel between Tunisia and western Sicily. This study explores the material vestiges of cross-channel migrations through assemblages identified during fieldwork by the Arizona Sicily Project along the southwest coast of Sicily in the summers of 2018 and 2019. While the exigencies of maritime crossing require distinct technologies of mobility, certain elements of migrant material culture are analogous to that found elsewhere, e.g. along the US–Mexico border zone of Arizona's Sonoran Desert. Such elements include migrants' strategic triangulation of speed, invisibility and survival in deciding what to bring and the tactical triage of gear en route. Moreover, the political and economic injustices that are catalysts for the movements are comparable, as is the criminalization of the migrants, which has done more to endanger than dissuade them. This article sheds new light on migrant choices and challenges and contributes to the archaeology of contemporary migration.",E.

23841,ZRE-283698-22,"Most Americans today would not think of their local church as a site for arbitration and would probably be hesitant to bring their property disputes, moral failings, or personal squabbles to their kin and neighbors for judgment. But from the Revolutionary Era through the mid-nineteenth century, many Protestants imbued local churches with immense authority. Through their ritual practice of discipline, churches insisted that brethren refrain from suing each other before ""infidels"" at local courts and claimed jurisdiction over a range of disputes: not only moral issues such as swearing, drunkenness, and adultery but also matters more typically considered to be under the purview of common law and courts of equity, including disputes over trespass, land, probate, slave warranty, and theft.    In?Law in American Meetinghouses, Jeffrey Thomas Perry explores the ways that ordinary Americans—Black and white, enslaved and free—understood and created law in their local communities, uncovering a vibrant marketplace of authority in which church meetinghouses played a central role in maintaining their neighborhoods' social peace. Churches were once prominent sites for the creation of local law and in this period were a primary arena in which civil and religious authority collided and shaped one another. When church discipline failed, the wronged parties often pushed back, and their responses highlight the various forces that ultimately hindered that venue's ability to effectively arbitrate disputes between members. Relying primarily on a deep reading of church records and civil case files, Perry examines how legal transformations, an expanding market economy, and religious controversy led churchgoers to reimagine their congregations' authority. By the 1830s, unable to resolve doctrinal quibbles within the fellowship, church factions turned to state courts to secure control over their meetinghouses, often demanding that judges wade into messy ecclesiastical disputes.",Jeffrey Thomas Perry,05/24/2022,Filson Historical Society and Virtual,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAhOpG6Bq4,"Recording of lecture: Law in American Meetinghouses: Church Discipline and Civil Authority in Kentucky, 1780-1845 by Jeffrey Thomas Perry",,,"Law in American Meetinghouses: Church Discipline and Civil Authority in Kentucky, 1780-1845"

23848,RA-50108-12,"As the imperial ideology of Ottomanism and modern discourses of citizenship spread, so did the understanding of laziness as a social disease that the 'Ottoman nation' needed to eradicate. Inventing Laziness asks what we can learn about Ottoman history over the long nineteenth-century by looking closely into the contested and shifting boundaries of the laziness - productivity binary. Hafez explores how 'laziness' can be used to understand emerging civic culture and its exclusionary practices in the Ottoman Empire.  A polyphonic involvement of moralists, intellectuals, polemicists, novelists, bureaucrats, and, to an extent, the public reveals the complexities and ambiguities of this multifaceted cultural transformation. Using a wide variety of sources, Hafez's book explores the sustained anxiety about productivity that generated numerous reforms as well as new understandings of morality, subjectivity, citizenship, and nationhood among the Ottomans.",Melis Hafez,01/31/2023,"online and in person, at ARIT Istanbul",https://aritweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hafez-Inventing-Laziness.pdf,event announcement,,,"Book talk on ""Inventing Laziness"""

23898,RA-259286-18,"This talk focuses on how Ottomans talked about books in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Ottoman Empire was a heavily manuscript-oriented society and the imperial administration left behind an immense paper trial. Yet, while many manuscripts circulated in Ottoman lands since the fourteenth century, access to books was not always easy. Ottoman scholars often learned about books not by reading them but by talking about them. Hearsay allowed for the transmission of knowledge around the material text, usually by reporting on the contents of a book that a scholar did not have access to, but that was somehow relevant to what he was writing. Through the analysis of biographical dictionaries and other literary works of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, I show that there were forms of communication other than written texts that predetermined what was put into writing, and that they might not have existed in opposition to each other, as in the dichotomy between oral and written, but indeed depended on each other. In other words, I will argue that texts and information were expected to occur in the performance of both the written text and oral communication, between the formal register and the informal interaction, and that oral communication had an important impact in how people remembered texts.",Oscar Aguirre-Mandujano,03/13/2023,University of Pennsylvania Workshop in the History of Material Texts,https://pennmaterialtexts.org/about/events/,event announcement,https://pennmaterialtexts.org/homepage,workshop home page,"Metaphors, Conjectures, and Opinions:  Talking about Books in Early Modern Ottoman Texts"

In the early eighteenth century, a handful of wealthy Boston families acquired the deed to a tract of land encompassing much of the state. The original proprietors and their descendants spent the next century luring colonists onto company towns to in order to improve the value of their claim. At the same time, the proprietors struggled to convince Indigenous Wabanakis, rival land companies, and even many of their own colonists to conform to their vision for mid-Maine.  In their quest to amass a fortune from their enterprise, the Pejepscot Proprietors left a rich trove of documents now held in the Maine Historical Society. Historians and other scholars from a wide range of disciplines have since made use of this collection to learn more about not only the proprietors themselves, but also Wabanaki people and colonists from all backgrounds.","Maine Historical Society, Ian Saxine (Bridgewater State Univ.), Darren Ranco (Penobscot) (Univ. of Maine), Sara Damiano (Texas State University), Alexandra Montgomery (Mount Vernon), Michael Blaakman (Princeton University)",08/20/2021,"Online, via Zoom.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-griMgAVNWA,MHS Historian’s Forum: Investing in Empire: The Pejepscot Proprietors and their World via Maine Historical Society's YouTube channel.,,,MHS Historian’s Forum: Investing in Empire: The Pejepscot Proprietors and their World

In North America, the Ulster Scots had a profound influence in shaping the culture and politics of the British colonies and their borderlands. Their story is one of rich contrasts.

24085,FEL-281761-22,"This talk investigates the ways in which digitally enhanced tourist performance in the PRC mobilize classicist aesthetics and poetics to connect classical literary topoi to a broader shared sense of Chinese culture among audience members. Since the early 2000s, the popularity of Zhang Yimou's ""Impressions Series"" has led to the growth of large-scale performances at destinations such as West Lake in Hangzhou, Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province, and Dunhuang in Gansu Province—locations that also feature prominently in classical poetry, Buddhist religious practice, and the Chinese national imaginary. These elaborate shows capitalize on the latest advancements in spectacular performance technologies and engage with the Chinese literary tradition, often literalizing well-known poetic images and literally overlaying the stage with Chinese characters, landscape paintings, and photographic images. Digital technologies transform live performance into a projection surface, yet in doing so also project a form of classicism that seems only skin deep. Building on the theoretical work of media studies scholars Giuliana Bruno, Audrey Yue, and others, this talk will explore the ""surface tensions"" inherent in these works. It argues that while critiques of the superficiality of large-scale performance remain valid, that very superficiality (as well as its rootedness in digital technologies) is also instrumental in enabling classicism to resonate with broader audiences. Examination of surface classicism in popular performances therefore allows us to reconsider the relationship between classicism and cutting-edge technology, materiality and immateriality, liveness and mediation in the digital age.",Tarryn Li-Min Chun,10/27/2022,Virtual Talk (for Forschungskolleg Humanwissenschaften of Goethe University Frankfurt am Main),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR9F0JqzvWw,Recording of virtual talk,,,Surface Classicism and Large-scale Multimedia Tourist Performance in the PRC

Knickerbocker, Vincent Sheean and Dorothy Thompson -- who in the 1920s and 1930s achieved world-wide renown.  They warned about the rise of fascism and championed anti-colonial leaders.  Diagnosing a drastic transformation of personal life, they chronicled first privately and then more openly, the slippage between their own relationships and world affairs.  They found they could no longer separate themselves from the crises raging around them, and spoke to readers who couldn't either.  In this session, Cohen will map out the shared terrain between international history and the history of private life, discussing the ways in which a potent combination of Freudianism, fascism, and imperialism made the relationship between the individual and the collective an exigent mid-twentieth-century question.",Deborah Cohen,10/03/2022,Zoom webinar,https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/last-call-hotel-imperial-reporters-who-took-world-war,Wilson Center website,,,Last Call At the Hotel Imperial: The Reporters Who Took on a World at War National History Center.

Hailed by the New Yorker as ""effervescent,"" Cohen's recent book explores a globe-trotting set of interwar American reporters who raised the alarm about the rise of fascism and rewrote the rules of journalism along the way.  Last Call at the Hotel Imperial is the extraordinary story of John Gunther, H. R. Knickerbocker, Vincent Sheean, and Dorothy Thompson. In those tumultuous years, they landed exclusive interviews with Hitler and Mussolini, Nehru and Gandhi, and helped shape what Americans knew about the world. Alongside these backstage glimpses into the halls of power, they left another equally incredible set of records. Living in the heady afterglow of Freud, they subjected themselves to frank, critical scrutiny and argued about love, war, sex, death, and everything in between.  Plunged into successive global crises, Gunther, Knickerbocker, Sheean, and Thompson could no longer separate themselves from the turmoil that surrounded them. To tell that story, they broke long-standing taboos. From their circle came not just the first modern account of illness in Gunther's Death Be Not Proud—a memoir about his son's death from cancer—but the first no-holds-barred chronicle of a marriage: Sheean's Dorothy and Red, about Thompson's fractious relationship with Sinclair Lewis.

Because human experience is holistic, the contribution of auditory information is significant.

For example, concert halls and recording studios are constructed to create pleasing acoustics for musicians and audiences. In such buildings, acoustics translate to auditory information that can uniquely identify a space. Moreover, visual information is dominant for 'informatic' experiences, while auditory information has been strongly associated with the 'emotional' aspects of those experiences, as well as with communication properties.

It also presents him as a pioneer who introduced such key scientific discoveries as heliocentrism and Toricelli experiments in barometry. The second chapter outlines Prokopovych's legal theory of Empire – his adoption of Hobbes' absolutism, his interpretation of Treuer's organic contract theory and his transplantation of the legal concepts of Holy Roman Empire, particularly the ideas of Reichspublizistik jurists, onto Russian soil.  This chapter argues that Russian Empire was founded as a juridical replica of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Third chapter documents Prokopovych's political theories and court politics that supported the rise of women to Russian imperial thrones. His political maneuvering led to the rise of Catherine I, Empress Anna, Regent Anna and even Empress Elizabeth, making the eighteenth century a century of empresses in Russia.","Ivanov, Andrey V.",03/20/2023,"Curti Lounge, Dept of History, University of Wisconsin - Madison",,,,,Apostle of Enlightenment: Feofan Prokopovych and the Rise of Russian Empire

This seminar presentation will explore the changes within the early imperial East Slavic Orthodoxy (in Muscovy and Ukraine in particular) as an important case for evaluating the Reformation's effect beyond the realms of Protestantism and Catholicism. The presentation presents a thorough analysis of ecclesiastical, ideological and political reforms of Ukrainian archbishop Feofan Prokopovych (1681-1736), extolled by Halle Pietists as Orthodoxy's own ""Luther."" Such reforms, the presentation will argue, should be viewed not in isolation from but in connection to a much wider European continuum of religious change. Such a context involved, inter alia, the systematization of doctrine, confessionalization, adoption of the principle of harmony between faith and reason, reaction against early modern Catholicism, scriptural vernacularization, sanctification of the work ethic and eventual emergence of an ""enlightened"" concord of church-state relations, that made the state more sacred and the church more secular.

LA's suburban identity originated in the early twentieth century, when city leaders developed a set of ideas and innovative land development practices centered on the suburban ideal. This vision embraced decentralized development as well as racial segregation.  Influenced by a regional eugenics movement, LA leaders pioneered and honed tools of racial exclusion in suburbia.  With this suburban vision in place, distinct built landscapes emerged. Over 130 years, LA's historic suburban landscapes included borderlands, streetcar suburbs, picturesque enclaves and garden suburbs, modest subdivisions before 1940, sitcom suburbs, and edge cities and corporate suburbs.
