Dolley Madison lived through two wars, knew the first twelve Presidents, and watched America evolve from a struggling young republic to the first modern democracy in the world. At a time when women could neither vote nor participate officially in politics, Dolley Madison, wife of the fourth President, James Madison, became one of the most influential and best loved figures of her day. When she died in 1849 at the age of 81 -  one of the last remaining members of the founding generation - Washington City honored her with the largest state funeral the capital had ever seen. , Dolley Madison is a 90-minute PBS prime-time special that will re-introduce Americans to this charismatic First Lady, examining her role as one of the most influential American women of the early nineteenth century. Viewers will learn how Dolley Madison used her skills as the nation's first great political hostess to create a distinctly American political style—one that embodied the new country's republican values.

Having collected these statistics, it is required to share them with its population and the EU, and—crucially—it continually reforms its institutions and practices in light of the new statistical knowledge.  This paper argues that the relationship between statistics and social forms is not solely one of ""description.""  To the extent that statistics do not merely study or represent the objects they are purported to be about, but are intimately involved in intervening in/on those objects (e.g. social, economic, or ecological processes) and in fact in remaking them through ‘reform' and/or ‘development,' they have a performative nature.  In this sense statistics are less a methodology and more a technology--a technology of governance.

11222,FB-57108-13,"I have spent the last two decades studying medieval and early modern Islamic maps in depth. These studies involved extensive on-site visits to manuscript libraries through which I collected thousands of images of medieval Islamic maps ranging in date from the eleventh century to the nineteenth. The sheer number of these extant maps tells us, at least from the thirteenth century onwards when copies of these map-manuscripts begin to proliferate, that the world was a much-depicted place. It loomed large in the medieval Muslim imagination. It was pondered, discussed, and copied with minor and major variations again and again, and all with what seems to be a peculiar idiosyncrasy to modern eyes: the cartographers did not strive for mimesis (imitation of the real world). They did not show irregular coastlines even though some of the geographers whose work includes these maps openly acknowledge that the landmasses and their coastlines are uneven. They present instead a deliberately schematic layout of the world and the regions that comprised the Islamic empire that can be best described as ""carto-ideographs.""&#x0D; &#x0D; I started a digital project called MIME—Medieval Islamic Maps Encyclopedia—to place these maps on an interactive CD and online web-based format in order to make this rich resource available to scholars, students, and the general public. The mainstay of MIME are the maps found in the manuscripts of al-I??akhri, Ibn ?awqal, and al-Muqaddasi—also known as the ""Islamic Atlas."" The aim of MIME is to decode the place and space matrix on these carto-ideographs so that anyone, with or without Arabic, can browse them and understand how medieval Muslim cartographic artists and their patrons perceived their world.",OA,"Digital Islamic Humanities, Brown University","Video, Web",https://islamichumanities.org/conference-2015/,Elias Muhanna,Scroll down to Session 3,http://youtu.be/rkZe3galDUY,Youtube link,MIME and Other Digital Experimentations with Medieval Islamic Maps,Karen Pinto,2015

At once a sea adventure, a cautionary economic and environmental tale, and a mythic saga of man and nature, the film tells the saga of three centuries of American whaling—interweaving the riveting tale of the doomed whaleship Essex, which set sail from Nantucket in the summer of 1819 and the deeply moving story of a young whaleman named Herman Melville—whose own life and imaginative voyage into the deep would give rise to one of the greatest works of literature ever created by an American.",,Ric Burns,"Film, DVD",,"Ric Burns, Bonnie Lafave, Mary Recine, Robin Espinola",,,,American Experience: Into the Deep: Whaling and America,Ric Burns,2010

The film tells how even as chattel slavery came to an end in the South in 1865, thousands of African Americans were pulled back into forced labor with shocking force and brutality. It was a system in which men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of masters. Tolerated by both the North and South, forced labor lasted well into the twentieth century. Slavery by Another Name gives voice to the largely forgotten victims and perpetrators of forced labor and features their descendants living today.

The film will highlight the years of violence that accompanied the miners' attempts to form a union, culminating in the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921, the largest civil insurrection in the United States since the Civil War.",,Randall Mark MacLowry,"Film, DVD",http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/theminewars/,Randall Mark MacLowry,PBS website,,,The Mine Wars,Mark Zwonitzer,2017

My work is focused on situating the transmission of flintknapping knowledge between mobile Epipaleolithic (20,000 - 10,500 BP) hunter-gatherer peoples of the Levant through chaîne opératoire. By refitting bladelet cores at Kharaneh IV, Jordan, I strive to identify how individuals learned to flintknap, from raw material acquisition through the production of the final tool. I view the knowledge transmission process as a proxy for culture, as apprentices took on new ideas and identities to fit within a community of practice, the apprentice may have lost (or maintained) kinship ties yet subscribed to a more meaningful relationship within their community of practice. Kharaneh IV is an Early and Middle Epipaleolithic aggregation site well -situated for this research to examine the learning process due to its well-preserved stratigraphy numerous caches, and hut structures, which allows for observation of repetitive practices and identification of changes in technique.

The important events of Coleman's biography are intercut with various humanities themes, including: challenges to gender roles and race-based limitations, technological change, class issues, historical events like the Great Migration, race riots, segregation, the Ku Klux Klan, and lynchings, and the limited but nonetheless real opportunities for black women in the new industrial urban age at the turn of the 20th century. The video showcases our signature style, mixing archival black and white photographs, films, and newspaper images together with Chabannes' unique and colorful artwork and animations. It features on-camera interviews with playwright and actress Madeline McCray, who wrote a play about Coleman (""A Dream to Fly"") and was profoundly influenced by her, and U.S. Air Force Colonel Merryl Tengesdal, the first and only African American woman to fly the U2 plane, and one of only 4% of pilots in the U.S. today who are women. Narration signposts critical facts about Coleman's life and context, and voice-over brings her own voice back to life with quotations pulled from newspaper interviews she conducted during her lifetime.

Sammy Davis, Jr. had the kind of career that was indisputably legendary, so vast and multi-faceted that it was dizzying in its scope and scale. And yet, his life was complex, complicated and contradictory. Davis strove to achieve the American Dream in a time of racial prejudice and shifting political territory. He was the veteran of increasingly outdated show business traditions trying to stay relevant; he frequently found himself bracketed by the bigotry of white America and the distaste of black America; he was the most public black figure to embrace Judaism, thereby yoking his identity to another persecuted minority. Featuring new interviews with such luminaries as Billy Crystal, Norman Lear, Jerry Lewis, Whoopi Goldberg and Kim Novak, with never-before-seen photographs from Davis' vast personal collection and excerpts from his electric performances in television, film and concert, ""Sammy Davis, Jr.: I've Gotta Be Me"" explores the life and art of a uniquely gifted entertainer whose trajectory blazed across the major flashpoints of American society from the Depression through the 1980s.","Broadcast, accessible for limited time online, then on PBS Passport for members",Sam Pollard,"Film, DVD, Web",http://https://indee.tv/screener/view/KtHXri0CIcag2uws4xhCwIo9J0WW56Hp/,"Sally Rosenthal, Michael Kantor",This is the broadcast version of the film.,,,"AMERICAN MASTERS--Sammy Davis, Jr.: I've Gotta Be Me",Laurence Maslon,2019

With testimony from the soldiers on the frontlines, civilians caught in the crossfire, political leaders from then and now, journalists and historians, the film is a comprehensive re-examination of a war that took the lives of tens of thousands of American GIs and millions of Koreans. It is a war that has raged for generations. A war that most Americans don't remember, and Koreans can never forget. The film documents how the conflict has continued post-1953; the events that triggered North Korea's nuclear program; and South Korea's economic expansion. The consequences of the war's stalemate contribute to a dangerous stand-off between north and South Korea, the United States and China. The 'end' of this conflict is still an open question.","The film was made available to the general public through broadcast and streaming at the time of its release.

As is well known, there are problems, generated by various paradoxes, the most famous being the Liar. We will discuss, among other things, Tarski's original approach and how it might be extended. The relevance of Gödel's work, and alternative ways of looking at the (first) Gödel incompleteness theorem. And, of course, my own work in this area, which in addition to a treatment of truth, mentions some other ways of looking at the Gödel incompleteness theorem.

17303,RQ-255700-17,"Between the 1930s and the 1970s there was a general consensus amongst logicians that the best solution to the Liar and related paradoxes was Tarskian: no language can be allowed to contain its own truth predicate. In the 1970s this consensus disappeared, and it is now more generally held that an appropriate solution should accommodate a language with its own truth predicate. How that should be done is, of course, another matter.  In this course, we will be reading and discussing a number of papers that deal with that issue from a variety of different perspectives. Topics to be discussed include (hopefully): classical vs non-classical logic, definitions of truth vs axiomatic theories, fixed point constructions, dialetheism, conditionals and restricted quantification, revenge paradoxes, sub-structural solutions.",Available upon request to the general public upon at the Saul Kripke Center.,Yale Weiss,Digital File,ttps://saulkripkecenter.org,Romina Padro,Saul Kripke Center Website.,,,"Video recordings of the 2019 Fall seminar, “Truth and the Liar Paradox”.","Hartry Field, Saul Kripke, and Graham Priest",2019

17489,PW-264175-19,"There are no other sense-altering aspects of culture that equate with language's effect on aural perception (hearing). Increased sensitivity to pitch is a cognitive characteristic in the 60% of the world's ethnolinguistic cultures that speak tone languages (Yip 2002). Lexical tone is a pitch contrast akin to the contour of a melody that distinguishes between words. An example is [íké] (high-high, like a repeated note) and [íkè] (high-low, like a falling interval) which forms a minimal pair between the Ìgbò words for strength and buttocks. Being a tone language speaker also impacts ways of musicking, especially singing. This is the case in sub-Saharan Africa, where ""language and music are [] tied, as if by an umbilical cord"" (Agawu 2016:113).  A favorite tool for evangelism among 19th- and 20th-century European missionaries in West Africa was to translate European hymn texts into the language of the missionized and teach them to sing the translation to the original hymn tune. An example included in the video is ""All hail the power of Jesus' name"" which is often sung to the Coronation hymn tune by Oliver Holden (1792). Unfortunately, early missionaries would translate the texts metrically (to preserve the number of syllables) but had no understanding of the necessary tone. Drawing on field recordings gathered in Nigeria from 2011–2020 by the authors, and commentary by Ekwueme and Dr. Christian Onyeji, this SMT-V entry studies the phenomenon of ""tone-and-tune"" in Ìgbò culture.",open access,"Aaron Carter-Enyi, Quintina Carter-Enyi",Web,https://vimeo.com/448178213,Africana Digital Ethnography Project,Video is available on the Society for Music Theory's vimeo channel.,,,Melodic Languages and Linguistic Melodies: Text Setting in Igbo,"Aaron Carter-Enyi, Quintina Carter-Enyi",2020

This behind-the-scenes look showcases some of the challenges students faced, from learning how to position themselves in front of a camera to building trust despite never meeting each other in person. As the team workshopped ideas throughout the semester, cast members were allowed to incorporate their own stories into the script.  Based on the initial idea to work with CSUN's Tom &amp; Ethel Bradley photographic collections, Professors Douglas Kaback and J'aime Morrison teamed with the Center director José Luis Benavides and researchers Marta Valier and Guillermo Marquez to curate a selection of Richard Cross photos documenting life at San Basilio de Palenque in Colombia. The UNESCO Intangible Heritage site was settled sometime in the late 16th century by a group of Africans who had escaped enslavement as they were being trafficked through the nearby port of Cartagena, a hub of the slave trade for the colonial Americas. Benkos Biohó, born to a royal family in what is now Guinea-Bissau, proved a formidable leader and secured freedom and sovereignty for himself and hundreds of other would-be slaves before he was captured and executed in betrayal of a treaty with the local government. The village gained sovereignty by royal decree in 1713 and continues today with arts and customs strongly inflected by the traditions of its African forebears, and it is that community that Richard Cross documented in the 1970s with a realistic, unidealized, and non-paternalistic gaze.",Open Access,Matthew Yahata,Video,https://youtu.be/-hinBOwa-f0,Tom &amp; Ethel Bradley Center,Bradley Center's YouTube Channel.,,,"SYZYGY: The BLK Light Mixtape, behind the scenes",Matthew Yahata,2021

It is made up of a series of cellulose acetate sheets, similar to those used in x-rays. It has rarely been displayed as it is 13ft long and over 9ft wide. As such, it had been rolled in storage for many years. It was important to evaluate the condition of the work, take documentation photos, and make sure there was no evident damage after being left in storage for so long. During her site visit, photography conservator Kim Du Boise assessed the current state of the work and advised museum staff to add archival buffered interleaving tissue to create a barrier that would stabilize and protect the emulsion. The outside of the work was then wrapped with tyvek, an archival water-resistant material that will keep the piece protected from dust for long-term storage.

During the spot check, Mrs. Du Boise identified another crucial conservation project – to remove soil on the surface and replace the cardboard backer on a vintage 1910 orotone by Volusia County photographer R. H. LeSesne. This orotone featuring a bucolic Florida waterscape was acquired by the museum in 2001. Given its age – over 110 years old – the work is in remarkable condition with only moderate scratches and soil build up on the surface of the plate, concentrated near the perimeter of the frame. However, the backing board used in framing was non-archival cardboard which is acidic and can cause deterioration of the plate with prolonged exposure. As such, it was necessary to unframed and replace the backing board.  Photography conservator Kim Du Boise examined this work during her spot check of the inventory and advised SMP staff about what could safely be done to remove the dirt and grime from the surface, and mitigate further damage caused by the acidic board. Upon advice of the conservator, SMP Director Erin Gordon carefully removed the rusted nails holding the cardboard backer in place. Then, using soft, lint-free, anti-static wipes and distilled water, Gordon carefully cleaned the surface to remove the built up soil. A new acid-free, archival backing board was cut to replace the cardboard and a thin protective layer of Plexiglas was added to shield the surface from further scratches. Rust-resistant framer's points secured everything in place, and the work is now ready for display.",,erin gordon,Video,https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQMNQCGNecu/?utm source=ig web copy link,erin gordon,behind-the-scenes video shared on the Southeast Museum of Photography's social media account,,,LeSesne Orotype Conservation,Erin Gordon,2021

21087,HC-278125-21,"Historical maps contain detailed geographic information difficult to find elsewhere, but they typically exist as scanned images without searchable metadata. Existing approaches for making historical maps searchable rely on tedious manual work (including crowd-sourcing) to generate their metadata (e.g., geolocations and keywords). Optical character recognition (OCR) software could alleviate the required manual work, but the recognition results are individual words instead of location phrases (e.g., ""Black"" and ""Mountain"" vs. ""Black Mountain""). Also, these recognized words are plain text and do not have semantic labels (e.g., place vs. road names). In an ongoing project, collaborating with the Alan Turing Institute, the British Library, the Library of Congress, and the University of Southern California Digital Library, we are developing a machine-learning map processing pipeline that automatically reads text from thousands of scanned historical maps and makes that text meaningful. The machine learning pipeline will transform how cultural heritage institutions can enrich and expose metadata about their digitized map collections. As a preliminary work for this project, this talk will present an end-to-end approach to address the real-world problem of finding and indexing historical map images. This approach automatically processes historical map images to extract their text content and generates a set of metadata linked to large external geospatial knowledge bases. The linked metadata support complex queries for finding and indexing historical maps, such as retrieving all historical maps covering mountain peaks higher than 1,000 meters in California. We have implemented the approach in a system called mapKurator. We have evaluated mapKurator using historical maps from several sources with various map styles, scales, and coverage.

The popular image of a plucky American rebel who fought for freedom against a tyrannical king is a celebrated one. The reality was very different. Often practicality, economics, or even proximity to a particular army could determine which side was supported or could cause loyalties to change. This presentation (22:27 mins) features historian Dr. Susan Ouellette, who explores these complexities and introduces us to one such ""practical patriot.""

With mixed results he dove into a string of jobs  — chicken breeder, actor, marketer of petroleum products, shopkeeper, newspaperman and traveling salesman — Baum continued to reinvent himself, reflecting a uniquely American brand of confidence, imagination and innovation. During his travels to the Great Plains and on to Chicago during the American frontier's final days, he witnessed a nation coming to terms with the economic uncertainty of the Gilded Age.

22305,TT-271564-20,"The rise of Jim Crow in the late 19th century caused public school spending for African American students in the rural South to all but dry up. Rosenwald Schools, the shorthand name for a program put forward by the educator Booker T. Washington and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, offered a way for communities to build the schools they wanted and needed. Rosenwald Schools took root in 15 states, with the program eventually helping to build nearly 5,000 schoolhouses. The program was especially successful in North Carolina, which constructed nearly 800 schools, the most of any state. One reason for the program's success was dynamic leadership – Black and White, male and female – who shared the goal of creating better schools for Black communities, yet who operated largely within society's conventions of that era. North Carolina's Rosenwald Schools remind us of a time when community people with few resources were united by a vision for a better future. They invested in that future and struggled to achieve it. The story of Rosenwald Schools informs today's younger generations about an era that has been missing from history books. It also has valuable lessons about community building and cooperation, which are sorely needed in these fractious times.","Documentary has been offered to PBS-NC to air on the statewide network.

23526,TT-271564-20,"South Carolina built more than 500 so-called Rosenwald Schools under the program devised by Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald. This unique program was responsible for providing elementary schools for an estimated 40 percent of South Carolina's African American children, according to a researcher at Orangeburg State University. Virtually all of them lived in rural areas. As in other states, the Rosenwald Schools became the centers of strong, supportive communities that nurtured Black youth, helping to prepare them for high school and higher education. Above all, supportive communities and the schools' caring teachers prepared the students for life's challenges in the Jim Crow era.   The prospect of integrating the state's public schools in the early 1950s, at the behest of the federal government, led to swift action by the state's elected White officials to build new, ""equal"" schools for African American students. Though this plan did indeed build scores of schools, it did not prevent eventual integration.  In the final analysis, the scheme to build ""equalization schools"" helped erase many Rosenwald Schools from the landscape. This makes the surviving schools all the more important as physical reminders and interpretive sites for an almost-forgotten chapter of South Carolina history.  Rosenwald Schools were a step toward correcting the inequalities in public education created by Jim Crow policies.   One of the many ironies in this story is that South Carolina voters, in the Reconstruction Era, passed a remarkably progressive state constitution that guaranteed free education for all citizens, Black and White. The person who advocated most for this right was Robert Smalls. Smalls was a previously enslaved individual who earned notoriety in 1862 for stealing an armed Confederate vessel under cover of darkness in Charleston Harbor and delivering it to Union ships offshore. Smalls remained a proponent for education all his life.",Open access,Jere Snyder,Video,https://vimeo.com/786070715,Tom Lassiter,"""The Bridge That Brought Us Through / The Rosenwald Schools of South Carolina"" is a 36-minute documentary examining the role of nearly 500 schoolhouses built for African American students in the early years of the 20th century.",,,The Bridge That Brought Us Through / The Rosenwald Schools of South Carolina,Tom Lassiter,2022

In April 1969, a small group of Black and Puerto Rican students shut down the City College of New York, an elite public university located right in the heart of Harlem. Fueled by the revolutionary fervor sweeping the nation, the strike soon turned into an uprising, leading to the extended occupation of the campus, classes being canceled, students being arrested, and the resignation of the college president. Through archival footage and modern-day interviews, we follow the students' struggle against the institutional racism that, for over a century, had shut out people of color from this and other public universities. The Five Demands revisits the untold story of this explosive student takeover, and proves that a handful of ordinary citizens can band together to take action and effect meaningful change.","It is available for festival, theatrical and educational distribution through Icarus Films.","Greta Schiller, Andrea Weiss",Digital File,http://https://vimeo.com/724634499/a3ab988ae8,"Greta Schiller, Andrea Weiss","Please note this is a private link for internal NEH use only.

24223,TR-280540-21,"This is the latest work sample of our in-production film, edited by Rachel Reichman. It highlights some of the film's main subjects who help project director Marisa Fox uncover her late mother's secret past and the larger, overlooked history of Jewish women's slave labor camps in Silesia and Sudetenland during the Holocaust. A journalist, Fox applies an investigative approach to her quest, moving past family members, who are conflicted and tight-lipped about her mother's secret. Instead, she turns to historical archives, scholars, survivors and witnesses, as her detective-like search unravels with suspense. Fox also finds a survivor in Berlin, who road-trips with her to the former Gabersdorf site. There, she hears camp songs that ring with defiance but also an eerie sexual subtext. At the core of the film is the collective camp diary in which Fox's mother wrote , which reveals an empowering story of sisterhood, resistance and faith, but it also confirms what Fox suspects may have kept her mother from speaking of her experiences --sexual violence. Because there is no historical footage of the camp, viewers are given access to this unseen world through visual renderings by artist Molly Schwartz, who will animate them for the completed film. We also hear passages read by teenage girls in Poland.  The subjects are indelible characters, each different from the other, living around the world, but joined together by a deep trauma they never previously shared. These are the last witnesses of a chapter of history that is well represented, but that shockingly neglected this narrative. Few filmmakers have explored the Holocaust through the lens of gender, which is one reason why My Underground Mother stands to make significant contributions to the humanities. The scholars, including last living Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz, help us understand why women's testimonies were buried as Fox seeks resolution.",,Marisa Fox,"Digital File, Web",https://vimeo.com/787235394 password: Gabersdorf23,"Deborah Shaffer, Marisa Fox","This is the latest work sample of our in-production film, edited by Rachel Reichman.

In conversation with Muhammad, filmmakers and #FirelightFamily Stanley Nelson and Loira Limbal will highlight the importance of impact and engagement in the life of a film, detail how Firelight Media supports the impact campaigns of our artists, and provide a lesson or two from their own impact strategies for films like The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution and Through the Night, respectively.
