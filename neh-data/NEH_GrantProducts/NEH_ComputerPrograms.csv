Researchers using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines have traditionally published to the web using processes such as XSLT transformations, which are intended to reproduce a work as an enhanced digital surrogate using HTML, PDF, or another publication format.  Processes such as these often contain the complete pipeline of logic that produces a publishable product, whether the product is a document, a data set, or visualizations.  Other approaches to scholarly software design offer opportunities to enhance the reusability of scholarly software tools by breaking apart these processing pipelines into smaller, more general-purpose chunks and providing an environment to blend and align tools from different domains.  To test this approach, the Brown University Library's Center for Digital Scholarship (CDS) and the Brown University Women Writers Project (WWP) have developed a prototype suite of software tools to explore TEI encoded texts in the Software Environment for the Advancement of Scholarly Research (SEASR).",Open source,"Andrew Ashton, Michael Della Bitta",http://repository.library.brown.edu:8080/fedora/objects/bdr:11456/datastreams/ZIP/content,TEI components in the Brown Digital Repository,Java,https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/TEI-Components-for-SEASR,TEI components in GitHub,Yes,TEI components for SEASR,2012

The second factor that hinder look-up is variable orthographic traditions. For example, some speakers might write the [wa] sound as 'wa', others as 'hua' and still others as 'ua'.

It breaks the barrier that discourages many editors from embracing the TEI concept of encoding texts for the long-term benefit of humanities research. A particular challenge is to get a good grasp of the many mutual or hierarchical interdependencies within TEI's XML structure. This software allows users, beginners or advanced, to understand the logic of those interdependencies through a navigational system that reveals connections between elements, attributes, values, attribute classes, datatypes, models, macros, and modules. It comes with two integrated but distinct sub-applications.  ""Explore TEI-XML Files"" is one of them. It helps navigate XML files and extract encoded data from them. Users do not need to master programming languages such as XQuery to query the XML. After importing any XML file, users need only use pull-down menus to examine complete alphabetized lists of tag elements, attributes, and values found in that file. Users then select any of those XML components in any order to display their related contents or related encodings in the interface's bottom field. Clicking any line in that bottom field selects and displays the related encoding in the XML file in the top field.  The ""XML:Lang Utility"" is the other sub-application. It helps XML practitioners fill in correct values for the ubiquitous xml:lang attribute—the attribute in charge of identifying the language in which any portion of a text has been written or spoken. The app is based on the IANA ""Language Subtags Registry"", a large database that provides a unique identifier for thousands of languages, dialects, idioms, scripts, and orthographies. The app not only provides the correct and well-structured code for any registered language, it also helps users discover languages and dialects while displaying more information than the Registry itself.",The software is provided free of charge under a BY-NC-ND Creative Commons License defined within a document that accompanies the software.,André De Tienne,https://peirce.iupui.edu/TEI.html,"A webpage within the official website of the Peirce Edition Project inder a tab labeled ""TEI-XML Software"".

21331,HAA-266444-19,"Scholars often collect sources, such as government forms or institutional records, intending to transcribe them into datasets which can be analyzed or visualized. This module enables scholars to identify the structure of the data within their sources, speed up the transcription of their sources, and reliably structure their transcriptions in a form amenable to computational analysis. Scholars can turn sources into tables of data stored as numbers, dates, categories, and more. Because this module builds on the Omeka S platform, it allows scholars to display transcriptions alongside the source images and metadata and to publish their results on the web.",open source,"Ken Albers, Megan Brett, Lincoln Mullen, Kim Nguyen, Jessica Otis, Jim Safley",http://datascribe.tech,,,http://omeka.org,,Yes,DataScribe,2022
