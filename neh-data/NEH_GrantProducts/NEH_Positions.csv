Such a research involves a critical reassessment of the representations of the Armenian Genocide in multiple languages and formats, namely, in scholarly and popular histories, in memoirs, in visual arts as well as in literature and music. This project is inspired by two major concluding observations in his previous research. The first one is about how the Armenian Genocide as a process, ironically, has served as a ‘creative' and generative reference that helped foster novel ideological formations redefining boundaries of inclusion and exclusion. Particularly crucial in this trajectory is that the Armenian Genocide sets an exemplary case for many other instances of collective violence in the broader region of the Middle East. Further, it marked the emergence of ongoing tensions in the region between authoritarian secularism and Islamist models for modernization, between predatory ethno-nationalist or exclusionary religious movements that advocate social/demographic purity, and advocates pluralist cultural traditions.","Research Fellowship, Frei Universität Berlin, Friedrich Schlegel Graduiertenschule für literaturwissenschaftliche Studien 2017-2019",http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/friedrichschlegel/fsgs/Institute/Kooperationen/Travelling-Traditions/2017-EUME/index.html,Presentation of current research fellows including Yektan Turkyilmax,,,2017

From Aristotle's infamous arguments for natural slavery in his ""Politics"" to Christian theologian Gregory of Nyssa's condemnation of slaveholding as an affront against the God in whose image humans are created, the question of human nature shadows ancient treatments of slavery. By engaging twenty-first century debates about what it means to be human, this project reframes discussion of slavery in the ancient churches.
