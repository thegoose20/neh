		<Abstract>The fellowship will be used to study the politics of Shia Moharram rituals in the Iranian settlement of Aliabad from mid 20th century through 2015. This study of revolutionary process in an Iranian village, analyzing how villagers understood and strategized about the 1979 Iranian Revolution, is based on research in Iran 6/1978-12/1979. Aliabad villagers applied Shia Muslim myth, ideology, worldview, and ritual, transformed into revolutionary meaning, to the Iranian Revolution.  Seven research trips to Iran since 2003 allow investigation of  Revolution's aftermath and belief systems, strategies, and practices regarding Shia Islam and Iranian religious authorities' teachings. Most Aliabadis were drawn to political Islam, thinking it would serve their interests and bring about a better society, then, disappointed, found ways to disengage from political Islam. Analysis will continue through to 2015.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Yektan Turkyilmaz, Roots and Routes of a Catastrophe: The Context and Afterlife of the Armenian Genocide (1915-2015).  Türkyilmaz's current project traces the genealogies of historiographical threads on the Armenian Genocide. Such a research involves a critical reassessment of the representations of the Armenian Genocide in multiple languages and formats, namely, in scholarly and popular histories, in memoirs, in visual arts as well as in literature and music. This project is inspired by two major concluding observations in his previous research. The first one is about how the Armenian Genocide as a process, ironically, has served as a ‘creative' and generative reference that helped foster novel ideological formations redefining boundaries of inclusion and exclusion. Particularly crucial in this trajectory is that the Armenian Genocide sets an exemplary case for many other instances of collective violence in the broader region of the Middle East. Further, it marked the emergence of ongoing tensions in the region between authoritarian secularism and Islamist models for modernization, between predatory ethno-nationalist or exclusionary religious movements that advocate social/demographic purity, and advocates pluralist cultural traditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As a 2018 Fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies, I will work on my book in progress, Ancient Christian Slavery and Twenty-First Century Debates About What Makes Us Human. This project couples analysis of the theme of slavery in selected Christian writings from the first to fourth centuries with assessment of twenty-first century discourses about what it means to be human. From Aristotle's infamous arguments for natural slavery in his "Politics" to Christian theologian Gregory of Nyssa's condemnation of slaveholding as an affront against the God in whose image humans are created, the question of human nature shadows ancient treatments of slavery. By engaging twenty-first century debates about what it means to be human, this project reframes discussion of slavery in the ancient churches. At the same time, a focus on troublesome ways that humanity is called into question in ancient references to slavery exposes limitations in contemporary conceptions of the human.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Awarded Fellowship to study repetition and creativity in three sets of documents from Ghent: chant 'borrowed' from the Abbey of Cluny, saints' offices, and aldermen's registers. During the Fellowship time I gave several presentations, one now online and cited here, compared the chant of the St Bavo gradual to those of Cluniac monasteries, produced some 50 music examples for an edition of the chant for the patron saint of Ghent, Livinus, with my research assistant (Univ. Maryland), completed hundreds of entries in my database of fifteenth-century foundations, and prepared a project (for 2019) to evaluate the texts of the aldermen's registers using the DEEDS algoriths with a statistician from the University of Toronto. I also taught a course using my Ghent material, on Music in the Early Modern City, Yale University, MUSI 245 (spring 2018). I plan to submit the articles resulting from this work in fall 2018 and the book in spring 2019.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This fellowship provides support for a project that examines concepts of character by exploring  relationships between verbal and visual art in the Greek Roman Empire.  Specifically, the book examines speeches on statues and monuments by three Greek orators: Dio Chrysostom (c.40-c.120 CE), Aelius Aristides (117- c.180 CE), and Libanius (314-394 CE). While the book is grounded in close readings of the orators' texts in the original language, I have conducted field research in Eastern Turkey over the last six years. This research supports  the argument that the invocations of art and architecture by these orators actually fulfilled important political, economic, and cultural functions in the Roman Empire.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is the essential ideological form of socialism, and can that form be carried, translated, and incorporated into different cultures through the work of intellectuals, individually and collectively? My study considers the intersecting careers of a cohort of socialists—Austrian sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld, Viennese architect Victor Gruen, and Hungarian artist-designer László Moholy-Nagy—who formed their beliefs and practiced their professions in the new republics of post-Habsburg Central Europe, and, as refugees from Nazism in the United States, translated an ethos of socialism within the foreign cultural context of American capitalism. While the critical theorists of Max Horkheimer's Institut für Sozialforschung— associates of Lazarsfeld who were also exiled at Columbia University in the 1930s and 1940s—have become known as the chief intellectual antagonists of twentieth-century consumer capitalism, the émigrés I consider in this project became the unlikely avatars of European social democracy in the "free-enterprise" culture of American business.</Abstract>
