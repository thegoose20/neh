The purpose of the present survey was two-fold: 1) to examine all the maps and atlases and incorporate their condition into the database, assigning them a priority for conservation treatment, and 2) to make recommendations for measures that can be taken in-house to improve the preservation of the map and atlas collection as a whole. The data pertaining to the first goal were turned in at the conclusion of the visit.

15613,FA-252317-17,"Since 2011 I have been documenting and researching rural singing in oral trad ition in the bi-national island of Timor.1  I have worked mainly with two ethnolinguistic groups:  the Southern Tetun,2 who live (a) in the southern mountains (foho) and south coastal plain (fehan) in Kabupaten Malaka on the Indonesian side of the international border, and (b) and in the adjacent Munisipiu Covalima on the Timor-Leste side;  and the Fataluku, who live at the far eastern tip of the island, in Munisipiu Lautem.   In their singing, both groups use complex, unwritten systems for incorporating pre-existing poems into a repertoire of melodies that are independent of the poems.  (That is, the poems are not fixed to specific melodies.)  The Fataluku poems are called vaihoho, while a common term for the Tetun poems is kananuk (also knananuk and aiknanuk).  Vaihoho and kananuk have different metrical structures, and the systems for setting them to melodies are different in detail, though similar in principle. These singing traditions are practiced now only by the elderly, and they are likely to die out in the next decades.  My ethnomusicological aim is first of all to document them in recordings while documentation is still possible.

17115,PW-259002-18,"This thesis analyzes the formation of early English colonial trade networks through an examination of three Plymouth Colony sites. Although Plymouth Colony has been studied extensively by both historians and archaeologists, materials from the original settlement have only recently been identified by University of Massachusetts, Boston archaeologists at Burial Hill in downtown Plymouth, Massachusetts. This thesis compares the 17th-century ceramics from Burial Hill (1620-c. 1660) to two homesteads established later by Plymouth colonists, the Alden First Home Site and the Allerton/Prence/Cushman Site. A minimum number of vessels (MNV) was established for each site and the country of origin was established for each vessel to determine the origin of consumer goods, specifically ceramics, in Plymouth Colony. These vessels were then divided up into ""English"" and ""foreign"" categories, and a chi-square analysis was conducted to determine whether the composition of ceramics was significantly different at Burial Hill than at the later two sites.   By comparing a site that likely pre-dates the implementation of most of the Navigation Acts (1651, 1660) to two sites that continue decades after their passage, it is possible to determine whether there was a significant effect on Plymouth's trade. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the difference between Burial Hill, the Alden First Home Site, and the Allerton/Prence/Cushman Site with respect to proportions of English to Foreign vessels is not statistically significant. This suggests that the percentage of foreign vessels did not significantly change over time. In addition, there were more English and foreign ware types found at the later sites than at Burial Hill. Combined with documentary evidence, this indicates that the Plymouth colonists were skirting regulations and establishing their own personal and intercolonial trade networks, even as the English government tried to limit them.",Open Access MA thesis,Elizabeth G.

At the same time, forest resources such as timber, metal, and land for agricultural production are vital for economic development. In Cambodia, economic development stalled while the country and region suffered war for over thirty years from the late 1960s through the late 1990s. Instituting democracy in Cambodia restarted the wheels of economic development as sanctions lifted, making space for national and international investments to exploit Cambodia's resources(World Bank 1993; World Bank 1992; World Bank, UNDP, and FAO 1996). Since that time, the impact on resources in Cambodia has been profound and forest loss is among the most visible.

17567,RZ-230366-15,"The management of lithic raw materials is a significant concern to anthropological archaeologists interested in hunter-gatherer socio-economies. A wide range of studies have implicated quarry distance, work needs, occupational longevity, and consumer population to variation in tactics for reduction, use, and maintenance of chipped stone tools. Fewer studies have examined socio-political factors in the organization of stone tool technology. This study examines the interactive effects of population, occupational longevity, favored prey, and socio-political complexity on the tactics by which lithic raw materials were managed in a long-lived winter pithouse in North America's interior Pacific Northwest. Results of bivariate and multivariate analyses implicate variability in toolstone economies as related to different classes of lithic items. Lithic cores and flake tools were more extensively reduced in contexts of productive subsistence economies, high populations, long winter occupations, and material wealth-based inequality. Bifaces were produced and maintained in relation to needs associated with intensity of deer hunting. The creation and maintenance of slate tools was affected at least in part by the intensity of salmon fishing. Combined, these data suggest that the organization of lithic tool technology responded to multiple factors across the lifespan of the house.",Open access,"Anna Marie Prentiss, Thomas A.

These performances include theatre, dance poetry readings, and other contemporary performing arts productions; all of which all of which provide participants with opportunities to exercise their artistic talents.Facilitated conversations are conversations that allowed the facilitator to promote and probe respondents for information about the experiences as participants in Flutter Productions.  The results of these conversations were revealing about the challenges, struggles, accomplishments and connections that all participants experienced.  Conversations were recorded by both Center for Disabilities staff and Ms. Heather Pickering.  The conversations were transcribed and emergent themes were identified by Center for Disabilities evaluation staff.  While the transcribed data included numerous comments from persons with and without disabilities in different roles, we identified seven themes that that facilitated conversation participants frequently We organized them in the following thematic categories1.Finding a Voice 2.Changing Expectations3.Inclusive Cast 4.Friendship &amp; Belonging 5.""It's Ok to be Different...and It's Definitely OK to Not Fit In"" 6.It's About Community Leaders 7.

20209,FN-230212-15,"It was initially assumed that there were two related language varieties on Santa Cruz Island in the Solomon Islands. Later, it became clear that there were three related languages, since the ones in the split were not mutually intelligible. That left us with Natügu [ntu], Nalögo [nlz], and Engdewu (formerly Nagu) [ngr]. In recent fieldwork during September through November 2015, Boerger and her team of interns, plus a PhD student from an Australian university, all became convinced that Noipä is a distinct language from the other three, though clearly related. This conclusion was drawn from discussions with speakers of all varieties, with those from other languages telling us that they do not understand Noipä. And Noipä speakers also reported that the others cannot understand them. Noipä is spoken only in the village of Noipä , and the people there have at least a passive, but often an active understanding of either Natügu [ntu] or Nalögo [nlz], which border them on either side. To establish this more concretely, the team led by Boerger collected an oral Swadesh 200 word list with written transcription, the written part of which will be included in the new code request document, along with data from the related languages.",,Brenda H.

The information gathered and summarized in the Observations sections of the report is based on conversations with Director Beardsley and Curator Collier, visual observations of the condition of the facilities and collections, and a review of CNHC's current practices and policies. Interpretation of the facts gathered during site visits form the basis for the Discussion sections under each heading, and further analysis of the present situation in light of the museum's mission leads to the Recommendations for specific actions that can be taken to improve the state of the collection as a whole. Focusing on preservation issues, practical strategies are offered for making systematic improvements to collection storage. These are summarized at the conclusion of the report and divided into necessary and immediate goals and actions possible in the short-term, and medium to long-range goals that will require more time and resources to achieve. The museum's objectives for the assessment were to examine current storage practices and environmental conditions, and to provide guidance on best practices for care and long-term preservation of the collections, including training on how to recognize potential problems and strategies for improvements.

Consultant Annie Peterson of LYRASIS led the assessment, which included a video tour of the archives storage space, discussions about staffing, planning, storage, and other facets of preservation and access to HHF's archival collections.   The goals of the preservation assessment were:  •Discuss and document HHF's existing strengths, what staff are already doing well, and areas for potential improvement related to collections care and access  •Gather information to create this report documenting the current state of collections, site visit findings, and recommendations for improved preservation practices •Use this report to advocate for resources (externally and/or internally) to move forward with providing access and use of the archival materials  The assessment focused on preservation of physical collections. A digital collection assessment was conducted in 2018. Preservation entails providing sustained, long-term access to collections. Near-term access to collections was also discussed, as preservation and access are closely intertwined.   HHF staff have made excellent progress on describing and arranging their archival collections and are well-prepared to take next steps to make collections accessible and preserve them for access in the future. The digital projects that HHF has already worked on, the relationships that HHF staff have built, and the commitment to HHF's shared vision is a remarkable foundation that HHF will build on to maintain enduring access to its collections.   The recommendations in this report are intended to guide HHF's next steps.

Through the excavation of areas typical for daily activities, including plaza spaces outside of the structures as well as the interior surfaces of the structures, we seek to test for the range of economic, ritual, and food related activities that may be unique to individual households as well as those activities that are shared across a possible neighborhood.

The trustees of IAS selected the firm Kimmel Borgette to scope this important project. After an assessment of the alternatives and deep consideration of the library's long-term needs, we have decided to move forward by bridging the existing building with a steel truss system. A usable third floor will be added to the building without removing the existing original vaulted roof, thereby preserving the uniqueness of the original design. Please see the attached documents for renderings (""Library Design""). Within the attached designs, you'll see an abundance of office spaces to meet existing need and create capacity for new personnel to support interdisciplinary projects, open spaces for collaboration, seminar rooms, as well as multi-purpose spaces. In keeping with the paramount importance of preserving the building's revered architectural design, the proposed improvements are planned for minimal visibility. In addition, the planned renovations will make vital updates to the library to achieve much higher levels of energy efficiency; to bring the facility up to code; and to improve maintenance and accessibility. The project conforms closely to the institution's long-range strategic plan, in which a central focus is renewal and restoration of major campus infrastructure. The budget for this plan is now estimated at $11 - $15 million, dependent upon the prices of raw materials, inflation, labor costs and finishes.

24262,HAA-269062-20,"This project set out to think through different considerations that need to be made before building a data repository for prosopographic data through a series of workshops. The primary focus of the discussions was on how to build infrastructure that will actually be usable and used by its constituencies. The workshop generated a lot of discussion about the people who use data humanities infrastructure and how we can center them as we build new data sharing and preservation apparatuses.  The primary outputs of this project were the User Personas, which can eventually be transformed into a User Requirements document for a future repository developer. The ""Specific Goals"" column for each user outlines in detail the necessary functionality for this repository.",Open Access,"Stanley, Sarah",04/02/2022,,https://prosopreponeh.github.io/,,,,Repository for Prosopographic Data

24448,PW-269407-20,"The Green-Wood Cemetery, one of America's oldest rural cemeteries, was established in 1838 on 478 acres and is the resting place for 570,000 permanent residents, including Leonard Bernstein, Boss Tweed, Charles Ebbets,Jean-Michel Basquiat, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Horace Greeley, Civil War generals, baseball legends, politicians, artists, entertainers, and inventors. In 1999, it established The Green-Wood Historic Fund, a 501c3 organization whose mission is to preserve and maintain the cemetery, including its monuments of historical and cultural significance; to advance the public knowledge of Green-Wood; to conduct, sponsor, and host education programs in the community; and to safeguard the natural habitat and parklands of one of New York City's first green spaces. In recent years, the Fund came to appreciate the importance of its vast collection of institutional records, which contains the documentation for every interment since the cemetery's first burial in 1840. With engagement from an advisory board, the Fund sought to identify high priorities to focus its energies upon in order to advance its mission. Among all of the archival documents at Green-Wood — 3,000 cubic feet in total — the advisory board zeroed in on 60 handwritten, cloth-bound volumes, which recorded all interments at Green-Wood in its first century, known as the Burial &amp; Vital Records. A 2019 implementation grant funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, ""Providing Access to the Unexpectedly Rich Records of Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery"" allowed the cemetery to transcribe the ledgers, build a database and search engine, upload the records to the database, and build a web page to make the information accessible. The following pages, define, describe, and disseminate the project's details so that other cemeteries may replicate the program, others may harvest the data, and the public may search for the many residents in Green-Wood Cemetery.",Open access,"Julie I.
