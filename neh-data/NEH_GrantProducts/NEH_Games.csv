Created to engage kids ages 9-13 in learning ""from the inside"" of American history, each game or ""mission"" puts students in the role of a young person at a pivotal point in history. In ""For Crown or Colony?"" the player is Nat, a 14-year-old printer's apprentice who experiences events leading up to the Boston Massacre in 1770. As players progress through the narrative, they meet historic figures, witness key events, encounter multiple perspectives, and then make choices that reflect the challenges of the times. The series and its accompanying resources for teachers are available at no charge.  Mission US launched in 2010, and the first five games in the series were built in Flash—a format that will be phased out by 2020.

14983,RA-247969-16,"Arrangement was a central concept in ancient and early modern atomism, and also to Cavendish's atomistic poetics: each poem is not a stand-alone, self-complete, well-wrought urn, but a kind of tile that can be rearranged into different mosaics of thought. Cavendish undertakes one such rearrangement in her 1664 edition, where the poems appear in a radically new configuration, and with new lines, ideas, and word-choices. The shuffling of the poems across editions, I argue, is not a correction, but an experiment on Cavendish's part, an attempt to think through concepts of arrangement, atomism, and the logic of collection. Her experiment changes how we read her poetry, and, in a larger scale, helps us rethink histories of early reading practices as well as poetry's contributions to atomistic philosophy during the rise of science.",Open source,Liza Blake,http://philome.la/medrenliza/arranging-cavendishs-atom-poems-twine-experiment/play,link to game,http://philome.la/medrenliza/arranging-cavendishs-atom-poems-twine-experiment/play,,,Yes,"Arranging Cavendish's Atom Poems: Twine Experiment""",2019

The game challenges players to try to keep their jobs and their health while meeting their caregiving challenges.",available for classroom use through Prof. Levy,Traci Levy,,,,,,No,The Challenge and Inequality of Care,2022
22970,FEL-282998-22,"The current VR software (Dig@IT) is able to display stratified layers of excavation, and users can fly around the virtual environment to explore different parts of the scene. In this project, we propose to extend Dig@IT, particularly incorporating remote sensing data captured using different techniques. For example, laser-based remote sensing generates volumetric datasets, with several meters of depth. We will design an immersive visualization tool to allow users to slice through the volumetric data, in order to explore the environment as it would have existed in different points in time. We will also incorporate, as has been done in the current iteration of Dig@IT, reconstructed models, but this time leveraging predictive modeling gathered from non-invasive remote sensing.  The goal of the proposed extension to Dig@IT is to provide a seamless integration of reconstructed landscape and architecture gathered from remote sensing with the exact data models stemming from the excavation site. Ultimately, the user will wander through virtually reconstructed ancient cities and be able to explore current excavation sites as well as a simulated interpretation of what unexcavated areas would have been, based on predictive modeling gathered from remote sensing.",currently the tool is available only for the Duke community by lab subscription,Maurizio Forte,,,Unity 3D,,,Yes,DIG@IT,2022
