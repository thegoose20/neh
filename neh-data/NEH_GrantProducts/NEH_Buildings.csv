It has become the primary place for all information from local services to state services to worldwide questions. Our 2,300 sq.ft. of space cannot service the increasing requirements from our community. Our programs are only in the summer, because the only space available is outdoors. This severely limits the type of humanities programming that we are able to offer. Our community has 17.1% of its residents below poverty level and children under 18 years of age at 30% below poverty level. We have a somewhat diverse population with 26% Hispanic. There also is an increasing population of Native Americans from the Pokagon band of Potawatomi Indians. Our school system has 49% Hispanic/Latino children attending. We have a great need to offer English as a second language classes and the Pokagon Language class, but it is not possible at the present facility. We have no place for quiet reading, no area for author visits and no proper facilities for student tutoring. We have no area for displaying art exhibits. These are just some of the valuable programs needed in our community; let's talk about books, Family Health and Safety Fair, Latino Americans 500 years, Create a vision board, financial literacy, brain stem camp, creative engagement with youth, Great Stories club and Makerspace Lab. We also wanted to apply for the Michigan Humanities Council Arts and Touring Grant, but our facility has no area to accommodate the programs. All of these programs are important for educational and lifelong learning in our community. We can accomplish the above and much more with a new larger facility.
