Everywhere one looks these days, computer scientists are bringing text analysis to humanities scholars with tutorials, workshops, and toolkits. Nevertheless, crucial information is being lost in translation. If text analysis toolkits are to be truly successful, information needs to start flowing the other way and computer scientists must learn from humanities scholars what humanistic text analysis really means. If not, they will continue making ""natural"" assumptions that do not always translate into the humanities. For example, concepts like ""question"", ""hypothesis"", ""data"", ""evidence"" are always well-defined in scholars' minds and are universal to all analysis. In the extreme case, this misalignment of basic assumptions could lead to fleets of powerful text analysis tools that nobody knows how to actually apply to humanistic analysis.",Aditi Muralidharan,2011-09-20,"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, B0131 McKeldin Library, College Park, MD",http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/?podcast=112,Podcast and Slides on the Institute's web page.,,,Large Scale Text Analysis in the Humanities: Methods and Challenges

2311,RQ-50471-10,"This paper speaks to what some in American Indian Studies have suggested is the Native Atlantic world, or the Atlantic world through Native eyes.  It demonstrates how during the Early Modern Period, American Indians were exploring and redefining their status as ""subjects of the crown"" in an increasingly violent colonial world, eventually leveraging that status against the colonies' reckless land policies.  &#x0D;  &#x0D; Such a perspective has resulted in some interesting questions.  For example, if the Indians' rights as subjects depended on the crown's prerogative, what happened to those rights when the king was removed?  How did the Indians understand the Restoration?  How were American colonial Indian policies responding to the changes before, during, and after the English civil war?  &#x0D; &#x0D; The answer to these questions reveals a fairly unexplored dynamic between government officials at Whitehall, their American colonial counterparts, and Native tribal leaders in New England.  I will address the foundations of that dynamic from its beginnings at the start of the 17th century through crucial subsequent developments which survived two wars – the English civil war and the New England Native conflict commonly known as King Philip's War (1675-76) – culminating in 1704, when the Mohegans brought their complaint against the Colony of Connecticut to Queen Anne's Privy Council.  Thus, the paper explores early American Indian policies not only at Whitehall but in colonial and tribal power centers in New England, sometimes with surprising observations.  &#x0D; ",Paul Grant-Costa,10/25/2012,"Early Modern Britain Seminar, Center for Early Modern Studies, Oxford University ",http://www.cems-oxford.org/current-events,,,,Owaneco's Pipe: A Prolegomenon to the Native Atlantic World

These courses teach students how to 3-D scan cultural objects with laser scanning and photogrammetry techniques. The possibilities through the application of these two techniques for tribal institutions and communities are amazing and ground-breaking, and should be embraced with some care and diligence. For although it will allow our objects to ""return"" to the communities from which they emerged in order to be utilized in a variety of educational and cultural ways, the dissemination of this data must be carefully guarded as well. This panel will first present the amazing work that the IAIA students have done in scanning the IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts' collection pieces, and then will move into a heart-felt discussion on the issues and concerns on how these and other technologies could have upon our cultural property rights.

Yet the evidence of both earlier Chinese histories and peninsular archaeology indicate that the two southernmost of the polities, Silla and Paekche, did not develop as royal states until the fourth century. Consequently, as complimentary as the presumed antiquity of these two kingdoms may have been, it also had the effect of creating an initial void of over three hundred and fifty years in their actual histories.&#x0D; The editors of the Samguk sagi evidently made use of several different strategies to fill the historiographic voids created by the impossibly early foundation dates that they credited to the two southern kingdoms in particular—for instance, the insertion of accounts of celestial phenomena extracted from China's dynastic histories, including some that could not have been observed anywhere in Korea. Many of the Samguk sagi's anachronistic entries possess, however, a persuasive ""ring"" of credibility, exhibiting compelling indicators of historicity such as the inclusion of specific personal names, ranks and places. The entries in this last group have the hallmarks of being antedated reports of bona fide events from the original accounts of the kingdoms.&#x0D; In my presentation, I briefly explain the basic elements of the methodology whereby I rectify the anachronistic dating of entries in the Samguk sagi and then illustrate the virtue of the methodology by applying it to several anomalous entries from the annals of that text.",Jonathan W.

3820,HD-50176-07,"One essential approach in preserving architectural heritage is the documentation of 3D geometries and surface textures of historic buildings. For example, precise colour information, excluding lighting effects, is an intrinsic property of the surface materials of building interiors and exteriors. However, while colour information has been recorded for small sample areas, it has not been accurately documented on the scale of entire building surfaces. This is critical, because building materials decay and their colours fade with time. The goal of this project is to develop a method to assist in recording and documenting the chromatic information of interiors and exteriors of historic buildings with low cost and high efficiency. The method takes advantage of emerging high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) technology, which can store rich information about colour and illumination through digital photography. By recording the colour information, in addition to the geometry and texture information obtained through other existing technologies, we can achieve more complete documentation for architectural heritage.

Ultimately the paper puts forth two claims: that the art and literature of Bronzeville balanced the aims of social realism with the experimental forms of literary modernism; and that the Chicago Black Renaissance was a movement with its own distinctive energy even as it was informed by a set of aesthetic concerns characteristic to Chicago more broadly.&#x0D; &#x0D; Writers and artists discussed in the paper include: Nelson Algren, Arna Bontemps, Gwendolyn Brooks, Horace Cayton, Jack Conroy, Eldzier Cortor, Ralph Ellison, Vivian Harsh, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Wayne Miller, Inez Stark, Gertrude Stein, Era Bell Thompson, Margaret Walker, Richard Wright.",Liesl Olson,"April 23, 2015",The Newberry Library,,,,,"White City, Black Metropolis"

4242,HD-51106-10,"It takes skills to tell a story. What skills it takes depends on the medium we use. Film is the medium of showing. What to show closer? What to show longer? What to show once, and what to show again?  Filmmakers have dealt with these problems since the beginning of cinema. Those who study film history today need to have a clear picture of how and why filmmakers made these decisions throughout time. What were D.W. Griffith's favorite camera set ups in 1914? What year was it that Chaplin learned to cut? Questions like these relate to film editing, and will keep coming up as long as film editing remains art. How many cuts does that seemingly seamless Birdman hide? How did they slice and splice the 12 years of real time in Boyhood?&#x0D; &#x0D; Cinemetrics is a website that helps to puzzle out such questions. Launched in 2005 as a digital tool designed to assess and compare various ways of editing films, Cinemetrics has grown into a global forum on experimental methods in cinema studies. Hundreds of film students and scholars from different countries, each with their own research agenda, submit shot-length and shot-scale data to the Cinemetrics website. For years, we have been comrades-in-arms in cyberspace. Between 2013-2015, the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society has enabled us to talk to each other face to face about the value of Cinemetrics data. As part of this project, from April 30 to May 3, 2015 the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society and the Film Studies Center will host the International Conference ""Cinemetrics Across Borders"" at the University of Chicago, which will bring together filmmakers and scholars from around the world.

Much of Szeemann's practice was centered around close collaborative relationships with more than 20,000 artists and a sweeping global vision of culture, that influenced the development of more than 200 exhibitions over a career that spanned nearly 50 years. Many projects, such as When Attitudes Become Form in 1969 and documenta 5 in 1972, were controversial and harshly criticized, but over time they have become landmark exhibitions of their era. The Harald Szeemann Archive and Library was acquired by the Getty Research Library in 2011, that now provides free public access to this immense resource of research materials chronicling Szeemann's work and practice though meticulously preserved documents, photographs, and other items.

5058,FT-230079-15,"This paper focuses on the presence of Agent Orange in Vietnamese culture and memory.  Not only is dioxin, the toxic byproduct of Agent Orange, found in Vietnamese soil, fish, plants, and human breast milk, but Vietnamese culture is steeped in Agent Orange.  Just about every school child and every tourist in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) will visit the War Remnants Museum—a peace museum, a historical museum, and a museum that interprets, teaches, and constructs the history of the American War and, especially, the history of Agent Orange as a chemical weapon that harmed and continues to harm the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese children.  This paper walks through the museum, stops at certain points in the Agent Orange exhibits, and then focuses on a surgical scene in the Agent Orange exhibit.  &#x0D; &#x0D; The photographs and objects that make up this particular section are an example of the warring themes in the museum's exhibit of Agent Orange. The photographs and the exhibits overall drive home the message that the nation of Vietnam and the Vietnamese are victims of Agent Orange. At the same time, the museum subtly insists that the people disabled as a result of Agent Orange are not victims; they are active people, who have made lives for themselves.  Yet, so many of the photographs—most taken by Western photographers—participate in what disabilities activists and scholars have named ""the medical model"" for they suggest that Western medicine and heroic surgery are the solution for disabled bodies.  These large and prominently displayed images rely upon and project older Western narratives of disability that put people with unusual bodies on display as freaks in side shows or regarded them as pitiful beings in need of help.  The presence and power of these images also suggest the difficulty of undermining those traditional views of people with disabilities, regardless of the intentions of museum curators. &#x0D; ",Leslie J.

As the family is variably defined (and enacted) in different eras of Western thought, so too are concepts of human nature, morality, and the state, for change to the former surely leads to interrogations and re-conceptualizations of the latter, and vice-versa.

10091,FB-55612-11,"This workshop brings together scholars from a variety of disciplines who work on diverse aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire. While the field of Vijayanagara studies has enjoyed a long period of productive interdisciplinary collaboration among Indian, European, and North American scholars, this collaboration has tended to focus on the Empire's material culture. This makes sense in light of the Empire's extensive art and architectural remains and the voluminous inscriptional records detailing their political, economic, and social significance. As this research on Vijayanagara continues to develop, additional work in Vijayanagara studies is being done in other fields such as literature and religious studies. We propose to conduct a broader interdisciplinary workshop that will expand the types of collaborations on Vijayanagara. The goals of this workshop would be to introduce new scholars and scholarship to the ""Vijayanagara scholars"" group, and discuss how new findings fit in with previous models. Because the Vijayanagara court's patronage of a variety of economic, cultural, and religious institutions and networks contributed materially to the theoretical and symbolic worlds depicted in the texts, one goal of the proposed conference would be to explore those connections more deeply. Precisely by examining the specific and dynamic links between material and other forms of culture, we might also seek to question the dichotomy between ""textual-based"" scholarship as pertaining to a theoretical, symbolic world and ""artifact-based"" scholarship as pertaining to everyday life.","Valerie Stoker, Ilanit Loewy Shacham, Kathleen Morrison",11/7/15-11/8/15,University of Chicago,https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/vijayanagara/,,,,Symbolic Worlds and Everyday Lives: New Directions in Vijayanagara Research

I argue that transmutativity cuts both ways, and that existential hope (as conceived by Gabriel Marcel) functions as a transmuted good by restoring dignity to those who suffer.  If hope is a transmuted good, overrides the consequences of atrocious harm, and emerges from a system of goods that cannot be explained by the atrocity paradigm, then the atheist's conclusion that evil ought to be rescued from theism cannot follow.

The paradigm struggles to do either.&#x0D;  &#x0D; Instead, certain moral goods—goods like forgiveness, altruism, generosity, or kindness-- provide evidence against the paradigm's view that atrocious harms deprive a person from living a tolerable life. This paper argues that love, as a foundational ‘transmuted good' that functions within a part of a correlative moral system, better explains our moral obligation to others, a universal duty to preserve human dignity, and the ability to create meaning after an atrocity.

In the following, I map out Marcel's conception of evil onto his fundamental distinction between problem and mystery, show that the distinction creates two effective methodologies for dealing with evil in the world (the problem approach and the mystery approach), draw the antinomy of evil based on these methodologies, and then demonstrate that the antinomy can be dissolved through an existentially-engaged, communal encounter with evil.

Although the project of using narrative as a way to do theodicy should be preserved, this paper will cast doubt on the ability of second-personal narratives to meet the criticisms of the atrocity paradigm, and will instead suggest that first-person plural standpoint can better rescue narrative as a theodical tool. The conditions of intersubjectivity found within O'Connor require more than mere interconnectedness among characters, and more than seeing others as only ‘others,'  but as intrinsically bound up with the sense of self . The result is such that, for narratives to be efficacious in theodicy, they must facilitate:  a)mutual respect between agents, which is absent between the empowered and the oppressed; b) an univocal relationship between agents when a moral claim is made-- although power relationships are frequently equivocal and, for the oppressed, implicitly threatening; and c) a felicity condition in which the addressee has reason to respond to the claim made by the narrative, even though feminists would argue that such a consideration disproportionately negatively impacts women.",Jill Hernandez,"September 17-19, 2015","Georgia State College, Flannery O'Connor and Other Southern Writers Conference",http://www.gcsu.edu/sites/files/page-assets/node-906/attachments/program.pdf,,,,"""Intersubjectivity and Narrative Theodicy; Atrocity and O'Connor"""
10554,HB-50471-14,"Rather than assess the merits of the contemporary distinction between abstract and concrete evil, then, we can use it to revisit Leibnizian theodicy to answer, first, whether there is textual support in Theodicy for the distinction, and second, if Leibniz's theodicy can justify divine perfection in the face of atrocious harms. Delineating between concrete, particular and concrete, atrocious harms has several benefits for Leibniz scholarship. This allows Leibnizian theodicy to rigorously (rather than incidentally) engage with concrete evil—and so the Theodicy can duck the atheist's contention that it fails to engage with the lived experience of suffering.  My distinction also removes the burden from Leibniz's theodicy to demonstrate that, for each person who suffers, evil contributes to the good whole of the individual's life, since the concrete evils that are explainable by theodicy are a genre, rather than an instance.  Finally, it preserves Leibniz's view that the goodness of God extends to the particular, relative to the whole, if God's best possible world includes a system of goods that can mitigate the system of atrocious harm perpetuated by evil human action.",Jill Hernandez,"July 3-6, 2015","Lampeter Campus of University of Wales, Trinity Saint David",,,,,"""Can Leibniz's Theodicy Account for Atrocious Harm?"""
10559,HB-50471-14,"ABSTRACT: Philosophers of religion have recently argued that second-personal narratives can be an effective theodical tool to defend divine perfection against the problem of evil. What it means to suffer, for example, is best conveyed by a second-personal standpoint, and narratives are able to connote this meaning in a way which resists propositional form.1 Critics—especially atheist feminist proponents of a secularized concept of ‘evil'—contend that theists can never successfully use narrative as a defense against the problem of evil because Scripture fails to speak to those who truly suffer from (especially) atrocious harms, and the narratives are never spoken by them since all of the narrators within the biblical text are men.2 Theologians have been particularly keen to show that narratives can produce theological knowledge3, but this paper will argue that philosophy's theodical use of narrative accounts can bridge the gap between the atrocious harm arguments of contemporary atheists and the epistemic function of theology's second-person standpoint. A caution will be given to philosophers, however: Although the project of utilizing narrative as a way to do theodicy should be preserved, this paper will cast doubt on the ability of second-personal narratives to effectively answer the criticisms elicited by the atrocity paradigm, and will instead suggest that a first-person epistemic standpoint can better rescue narrative as a theodical tool.",Jill Graper Hernandez,"July 16-20, 2014","Berkeley Dominican School of Philosophy &amp; Theology Conference, Berkeley, CA",,,,,"""Narrative and Suffering: the Problem of Standpoint"""

From promotional visual material, to luggage design, to ""indigenous"" crafts, to hotel furniture and landscaping, how does design mediate the tourist experience? How does design normalize the tourist's life back home by creating an experience of an other? Likewise, how does design offer a space for locals to exert agency in negotiating their&#x0D; representation? How does design interrogate the dichotomies that are negotiated in touristic experiences--near/far, familiar/foreign, inclusive/exclusive, comfort/discomfort, authentic/inauthentic? Papers may explore the ways in which design, as experienced by any or all of the senses, has either perpetuated the stereotypes of otherness or has contradicted and counteracted these stereotypes.",Sara Desvernine Reed,02/03/2017,"New York, New York",http://conference.collegeart.org/schedule/,Schedule for the College Art Association Annual Conference,,,"SESSION:  “So Near and yet so foreign: Negotiating Touristic Experience through Design"""

We are on the cusp of a new understanding of our national origins, seeing the American Revolution as a violent civil war shaped in large part by slavery and black participation. The Revolutionary settlement of half-slave and half-free thus defines a first Emancipation and first Reconstruction, part of a single ""long"" process beginning in the North and culminating in the South.

The project title Andvari evokes many features of this new research tool. Andvari (Old Norse ‘the careful one') is the name of a dwarf in Norse mythology, where dwarves are associated with arts and crafts. Andvari is the collector of a great treasure and a shape-shifter. Thus his character echoes the idea of a digital portal functioning as an aggregator and its utility in searching artistic elements transformed across media, regions, and cultures.&#x0D; The goal of this presentation is to explain the rationale for and the objectives of Project Andvari. Despite the wealth of the surviving visual culture from early medieval Scandinavia and neighboring areas, primary materials are often difficult to access, scattered in specialized, national collections. Researchers working on artifacts in one medium are often unaware of parallels in another and use different terminology to describe similar elements. Recently, several collections of material restricted by medium, object type, or location have been made available through online catalogues, but these subsets have remained unconnected. Furthermore, the search functions of existing databases are often limiting since they pre-structure material in conventional categories dictated by scholarly traditions.&#x0D; In response to these challenges, Project Andvari will facilitate interdisciplinary research in the northern periphery of medieval Europe, allowing users to study visual culture across media and beyond traditional geographical and disciplinary boundaries.","Nancy L.

This was an apt project for the growing Campinas department, in which, even now, a characteristic MA assignment is to produce an annotated translation of an ancient work not previously translated into Brazilian Portuguese, both as a kind of advanced basic training in Classics and as a visionary attempt to restore ancient Greek and Latin texts to the mainstream of modern Brazilian learned literary culture; the PhD assignment, after the MA, adds a research monograph to complete a published ‘package'.  A week spent hovering between Latin, English and (through interpreters) Portuguese was fascinating in itself and as living context for my own research project on Poetry across Languages; and, unexpectedly, the Campinas team turned out to be the ideal audience for my work in progress on Wordsworth's Aeneid.","Stephen Hinds, Stephen Harrison",11/17/14-11/18/14,"University of Campinas, Brazil",,,,,Grupo 'intertextualidade na literatura latina' / research group 'intertextuality in Latin literature'

The second reading suggests a more radical approach to the same think about what we are doing as we replace the natural with the built environment and turn the world into an artifact. It is thus useful to consider the dialogue between these two terms - using two approaches to one particular kind of technology, energy technology. Whether and to what extent we can develop an appropriate or an alternative energy technology will be crucial to the kind of world-artifact we will construct. This contrast will further distinguish two approaches to an ethical assessment of energy: Type I energy ethics is grounded in a belief that increases in energy production and use are both humanizing and civilizing; Type II energy ethics questions this belief and argues that beyond a certain point, energy production and use become counterproductive. Our technological way of life is currently determined by Type I energy ethics, although Type II energy ethics deserves a hearing. A provocative illustration of the Type II approach to energy will reference energy ethics and policy in China.

This twofold question poses the serious risk of transgressing upon the epistemological independence of the various disciplines: theology, philosophy, astrophysics, biology and cosmology, and creating, thereby, more confusion than understanding. Therefore, it is that possible to establish a fruitful dialogue between natural sciences, philosophy and faith? What are the conditions that render possible such interdisciplinary dialogue? From the religious side this dialogue must be limited to the rational foundations for religious belief.  The seminar included the following topics: (I) the Science of the Universe, Cosmology and Life's Origins, (ii) biblical faith and Christianity, (iii) possible models of interactions between natural sciences and religious faith, (iv) the limits of our scientific and religious knowledge, (v) what would both, natural sciences and religious faith, gain from a dialogue?","Dr.  George Coyne, S.J.",8/22/2014,"University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus",,,,,The Implications of Scientific Evolution to the Semantics of the Christian Faith

During the suffrage era, a time when women's organizations were gaining unprecedented political and social influence, American Catholic laywomen wanted their voices recognized in the national debates of the day.  They faced, however, both structural and cultural barriers in their attempts to do this.  I will focus on three interconnected problems the women who worked on the Community House project had to confront.  First, and most significantly, these laywomen had to battle both passive and active resistance of the patriarchal hierarchy who undermined the women's control over Community Houses.  Second, they had to negotiate complex parish and diocesan politics as well as deal with priests and bishops who resisted any attempts of outsiders to have influence over the Catholics in their jurisdictions.  Finally, they had to fight for respect from other women activists who viewed Catholics as backward, anti-feminist and possibly un-American.  Ultimately, these problems stymied the ability of Catholic laywomen to achieve their potential on the national stage.",Jeanne Petit,2011,"American Historical Association Meeting, Boston, MA",,,,,"“‘Up against a Stone Wall’: Gender, Power and the National Catholic Community Houses”"
11800,FT-56922-09,"This paper will examine the racial dynamics in the religious work of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) and the women of the National Catholic War Council (NCWC).  During World War I, the YWCA established an immigrant aid station to do outreach work among Mexican Americans in San Antonio, Texas.  Fearing that the evangelical Protestant group would try to proselytize Hispanic Catholics, the Women's Committee of the NCWC established a National Catholic Community House in San Antonio soon after.  Both organizations sent native-born, Euro-American women to run their programs, but these workers expressed strikingly different attitudes towards the Mexican Americans among whom they were working.  The YWCA women framed their work as one of breaking down racial barriers.  As one YWCA field worker said, ""there is no more important work that can be done in the South and Southwest than the obliteration of racial prejudice which now exists between American and the Mexican immigrant.""  The women who ran the National Catholic Community House, on the other hand, established policies that maintained racial hierarchies.  When one NCWC worker was seen in public with a young Mexican-American man, her superior said, ""This is a great mistake in this community as the Mexicans are not accepted as equals, and anyone seen in public with them handicaps herself and brings criticism on the work.""",Jeanne Petit,"June, 2011","Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, Amherst, MA",,,,,"“Religion, Race, and Catholic Women’s Community Work in San Antonio, Texas, 1918-1924”"

I begin with an analysis of the local work NCCW women did with Italian and Polish immigrants in the post World War I period and then turn to the ways NCCW women participated in national immigration debates in the 1920s.  As Weadick's quote reveals, the women of the NCCW were motivated by desire to protect immigrants from non-Catholic influences.  But the speeches, reports, and private correspondence of the NCCW members reveal other motives as well.  They sought to be as respected as other native-born American reformers when it came to debates about Americanization, restriction and quotas while proving to the all-male hierarchy that Catholic women needed a national presence in order to defend Church interests.  Overall, by competing for the souls of Catholic immigrants, the women of the NCCW were also making a case for their right to speak as both American citizens and as essential members of the American Catholic Church.",Jeanne Petit,"June, 2014","Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, Toronto, ON",,,,,"“Competing for the Souls of Catholic Immigrants: The Immigration Work of the National Council of Catholic Women, 1918-1929”"

The answer: ancient graffiti.&#x0D; The Ancient Graffiti Project collects graffiti from Herculaneum and Pompeii and displays&#x0D; its findings online, making the collection accessible to the public. The project provides an opportunity for students to view the Romans not taught in textbooks or seen in works by Caesar,&#x0D; Cicero, or Virgil.

12718,CH-50975-13,"Of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken around the world today, more than half are likely to no longer be spoken actively by the turn of the next century. In almost every case, these languages are spoken by groups of people, often indigenous, who are minorities in the larger societies in which they live. There are, however, a small group of minority languages that are not endangered and which in fact are enjoying robust vitality. In North America there are four such languages, which are spoken in conservative Christian and Jewish religious communities: Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish and Old Order Mennonites); Mennonite Low German (Old Colony Mennonites); Hutterite German (Hutterites); and Yiddish (Haredi Jews). The growth of these groups is exponential due to the twin factors of high birth rates and low attrition, thereby ensuring the sociolinguistic health of the languages they speak.  This symposium will bring together an international group of researchers specializing in these languages with Amish, Mennonite, Hutterite, and Haredi community members to explore sociolinguistic aspects of the social-spiritual identities of these faith groups.

12734,RZ-249862-16,"The concepts of ""Contact"" and ""Cultural Exchange"" have been complicated by an increased interest in polyfocal geographical and cultural imaginaries:  what comes into contact in the Age of Encounters are not identities or cultures with objective existences but, on every side, conceptions of the world and ways of being in it and the cultural techniques that organized such ideas and activities—ideas and activities that were themselves undergoing intensive and continual redefinition under the impact of the encounters.  We invite papers that address the encounters of the Early Modern period as meetings of symbolic economies and modalities of representation. We invite specialists from multiple fields to lead us inside particular geographical and cultural imaginaries. Those who study European explorations might contend with open questions, such as: Were the Yucatan and California islands? How large was the Pacific and was it an ocean? Was Cathay near Ochelaga (Montreal)? Was Ophir located in newly discovered lands, and where? Did the Japanese wear feathers? Should Mixtec masks be classified with Asian artifacts in European collections? Did Native Americans use parasols, did dragonfruit grow in the New World, and were there elephants in Patagonia? And who were ""Indians""? Asianists and New World scholars will have a corresponding series of questions posed from the point of view of their protagonists.

The book explores the connection between the Gothic and empire in Russian literature, focusing on the portrayal of Northern and Southern imperial borderlands as uncanny spaces. In this lecture, Professor Sobol will discuss the image of ""gloomy"" and Gothic Finland constructed in Russian literary and ethnographic publications of the 1840s. While being intimately linked to Russian foundational narratives, such the ""invitation of the Varangians"" and the construction of St. Petersburg, Finland emerged as an exotic and mysterious land after its incorporation into the Russian empire in the early nineteenth century. Finland's ambivalent status in the Russian cultural imagination, along with the Gothic connotations of its majestic sublime landscape and its reputation as a ""land of wizards,"" made it a particularly apt setting for the Russian imperial uncanny. The lecture will offer a brief analysis of Vladimir Odoevsky's novella ""The Salamander"" (1844) meant to demonstrate this function of Finland in Russian Gothic literature. While most ethnographic and literary texts depict the Finns as a magic-prone, semi-mythological people destined by both history and geography to be ruled by others and enthusiastically embracing the Russian civilizational mission, Odoevsky offers a far more complex and darker picture, using the narrative of the conquest of Finland to critique both Russia's historical path and Western modernity more generally.",Valeria Sobol,09/26/2017,"Russian, East European, and Eurasian Center, University of Illinois",https://calendars.illinois.edu/detail/7?eventId=33283765,,,,“‘Gloomy Finland’ and the Russian Imperial Gothic”

The novel attempts to conjure the ghost of the Ukrainian ""authentic"" and heroic past, before the Russian empire fully incorporated this region in the late eighteenth century, and produces a vision of its relative cultural independence and chivalric tradition in Gothic-fantastic imagery.

12970,FT-61611-14,"Literature has long been closely imbricated with practices of surveillance. Not only does literary production necessarily rely on practices of observation (either at the level of the individual or a broader collectives, as with the close synergy between the rise of the modern novel and Western imperial projects), literature itself has often been the object of close scrutiny by the state and other corporate entities. In this respect, literary representation anticipates—and is symptomatic of—a broader array of technologically-based surveillance practices that have emerged in the modern period. As technological advances continue to enhance the ability of states and corporations to surveil the public, even as the public is also increasingly able to deploy similar technologies to its own ends—including efforts to surveil the operation of the surveillance apparatus itself. This latter practice of counter-surveillance is particularly evident in the ways that citizen videos (and the public circulation of videos originally produced by the state) have helped precipitate a national debate in the US over police brutality, but it also has much broader ramifications.  Our panel will examine some of the implications of these developments as they pertain to the new security state. We are interested not only in how issues of surveillance and counter-surveillance are addressed in literary works, but also how some of the discourses and visual archives generated by these surveillance practices may be approached as virtual literary works in their own right. Potential topics include examinations of state censorship regimes, social media and practices of collective authorship, surveillance video and found footage as a form of textual production, digital archives and shifting loci of identity, practices of exhibitionism and impersonation, selfies and confessional discourses, as well as advances in wearable technologies and cybernetic states.",Belinda Kong and Carlos Rojas (seminar co-chairs),"March 18-20, 2016","Harvard University, Cambridge, MA",https://www.acla.org/sites/default/files/files/Full Program Guide 2016.pdf,ACLA 2016 conference program,,,"The New Security State: Surveillance, Counter-Surveillance, and Strategies of Resistance"

Coupling findings from recent breakthroughs in cognitive science and psychology with theoretical insights from political science, this paper presents a theory to explain how invented, embellished or simply unverified sources of security-related information can be strategically deployed to materially inform and influence public opinion as well as foreign and defense policy formulation and implementation. I show how, by exploiting inherent human cognitive, psychological and biological limitations and predispositions, enterprising actors both inside and outside governments—""merchants of menace,"" if you will—can strategically and successfully employ EFI to transform vague, (often) inchoate, and sometimes remote, objective sources of anxiety into proximate, and even existentially menacing, albeit unverifiable, threats to domestic and/or international security. This transmutation happens through a process I call ""threat conflation,"" which is related to, but distinct from, its heretofore more thoroughly explored cousin ""threat inflation.""

13039,FA-251744-17,"Rumors are ubiquitous, and their adoption and diffusion have been linked to episodes of political instability, violence and the eruption of war. But not all rumors survive or proliferate, and only some of those that do are disseminated widely enough to influence patterns of collective violence. A critical type of filtering occurs at the individual level: individuals have to assess whether to accept or dismiss new information, and the plausibility and credibility of a rumor's source are thought to be key factors in this decision-making process. Drawing upon original survey data from civil war affected areas in southern Thailand and the Philippines, this article examines where civilians turn to for information when verifiable facts are in short supply, and explores the impact of information source on the uptake and diffusion of rumors. Existing theories offer competing propositions about the relative importance of elites, the media and social and kinship networks in rumor uptake and diffusion. Our findings suggest that local elites can play a singular role: even though they may rarely be the primary source of unverified information, they are highly influential when they do spread a rumor, particularly one about which they might be expected to have inside knowledge.","Kelly M.

13080,FA-232431-16,"Ethnomusicology is often conceived as the study of cultural performances by living musicians and their roles in contemporary society. This implies that the field is lacking interest in historical approach to the formulation of performing arts. I argue that in order to fully understand any forms of contemporary performance genres, it is important to trace their historical formation and transformation. Formation refers to the process of formulating a certain genre in a particular period of history; transformation, the genre continues, change, modify, or disappear in accord with the changes of socio-cultural circumstances. This paper discusses contemporary gamelan and wayang from the above line of thoughts: in what ways and what is the result after the genres have to adjust themselves to certain historical and socio-cultural changes and the changing of artists' perspectives. Two main processes define the change and continuity of these performance genres: (1) the interaction between Java and other islands in Indonesia (intra-cultural interaction), and (2) the interaction between Java and foreign culture (inter-cultural interaction). I will illustrate the former by examining the dynamic historical relationship between Java and Bali, its impact on performing arts in both regions.

13271,RA-50003-03,"It has long been received wisdom that the Ottoman institution of the timar (fief / benefice / prebend) - which gave a virtual caste of cavalry or other servants of the state the right to tax peasant agriculture in exchange for military or other service - was a linchpin of that state's organization. Moreover, the timar is widely considered as crucial for the successful workings of the empire during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as, for example, the kapikuli (""slave of the Porte"") military-administrative institution. The argument continues that the timar institution essentially became defunct by the seventeenth century, thanks to the adoption of viable gunpowder weaponry, inflationary pressures in Ottoman currency, and corruption.

13974,RZ-249862-16,"What did Asia look like to early modern Europeans? Through a closer look at a variety of early modern European sources including printed texts, maps, Mesoamerican codices, and objects held in early modern European cabinets of curiosity, this panel explores some of the surprising and unpredictable ways that Europeans understood Asia in the century following the Columbian voyages. Copious European accounts depicted America as Asia by mapping both onto one ""Amerasian"" continent, where Mexico was India, North America was an extension of China, and South America was populated by a variety of biblical and Asian sites. ""New Worlds"" discovered to the East and West of Europe were understood to be convergent; as a result, European collectors sometimes labeled Mexican objects as Chinese, and as late as 1600, European missionaries believed they were baptizing the Indians of Asia. Other sources portrayed China as a superior civilization, but one that Europeans hoped to rival, intellectually and culturally. Far from simply portraying Asia as generically exotic or foreign, these papers explore the myriad and flexible ways that early modern Europeans employed representations of Asia: as a means of grappling with an expanding knowledge of global geography in the sixteenth century, and as a global standard of civilization to which Europeans could compare themselves. In the same period that Europe was coming into cultural self-definition, malleable representations of Asia helped Europeans to define their own global identity.",,"March 25, 2018","Association of Asian Studies Conference, Marriott Wardman Park Hotel, Washington, DC",,,,,Asia in the European Imagination in the Early Modern Period

By the mid-1950s, biomedical and life scientists along with clinicians began advancing alternative etiologies (causes) to explain the rise. One such etiology centered on the modern industrial chemicals in the environment and their effects on animal and human health: endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) that mimicked or blocked normal hormone functioning, including hormones associated with metabolism such as insulin. This discovery prompted debates over the reliability of longstanding toxicological models to explain exposure and health consequences. Scientific uncertainty also yielded further political challenges to identify, classify, and regulate EDCs. Despite controversies over EDCs and their effects, by the 1980s, environmental justice advocates embraced the ""environmental endocrine hypothesis"" to clarify health disparities among marginalized communities.

As such, this project begins by acknowledging distributed and diverse expertise in our communities, respecting diversity and difference, and affirming the power and value of our communities and networks, including both working collaboratively together as members of the investigator team as well as working in relation to our connected communities.",Project Team,5/20-5/24/2019,"Gainesville, Florida",http://dloc.com/teach/schedule,,,,Caribbean Studies Digital Humanities Institute

14559,FA-252460-17,"This paper suggests that the history of Iran–Turkey relations is one of secularisation notwithstanding the intense religious wars that consumed them in the early 16th century and their recent antagonistic projects in places like Syria. Shi'a Iran and the Sunni Ottoman Turks signed their first treaty in 1555 and recognised each other despite their sectarian differences. Subsequently, 10 years before the establishment of the Westphalian state system, the two parties signed a treaty that emphasised the principle of non-interference in each other's affairs and respect for territorial sovereignty. Iran-Turkey relations thereafter closely mirrored the development of European ideas about territorial sovereignty and non-sectarianism in international relations. The paper concludes that, given this history of secularisation, Iran and Turkey are likely to manage their interstate contention in the long haul.",Sabri Ates,07/05/2018,Singapore National University,,,,,Sectarian Affiliations and Turkish Iranian Relations

14758,RA-228585-15,"This paper centers on the Palestinian Arab town of Nablus and the controversies over electrification that took place there in the years around the 1948 war. The Zionist-run and operated Palestine Electric Corporation held a monopolistic concession for the electrification of Palestine. As a result, the Palestinian community came to vie electrification as the handmaiden of Zionist conquest. ""If Rutenberg electricity lights the city of Nablus and Tulkarm,"" one Nabulsi writer warned in 1932, referring to the general manager of the PEC, ""one can say that Rutenberg and his works have conquered the land."" That electricity was only available through a Zionist company presented the Palestinian community with a dilemma. Besides the imperative to reject Zionism and British colonial rule, many Palestinians also aspired to ""be modern,"" which to most included access to electrical power and light. As this paper will show, using previously unused sources from the Israel Electric Corp. Archives and elsewhere, the struggle over electrification in Nablus – within the town and between the town and the PEC – both reflected and remade the political fault lines of the Palestinian community in ways that would bear heavily on the Arab Revolt, the 1948 War, and life under occupation.",Fredrik Meiton,"March 8-10, 2018","Brown University, New Directions in Palestine Studies",https://palestinianstudies.org/workshops/2018/people/fredrik-meiton,,,,The Non-Electrification of Nablus

Such a project presupposes, first of all, to examine the prejudice according to which ancient philosophy on economics is either inexistent or embryonic. Many texts, on the contrary, show  the interest of ancient thinkers on economic phenomena. I intend to show that the ancient Greek economic thought does not take the form of the autonomous science of which we are today familiar, but obeys another form of coherence and another rationality, based on philosophy.  The thesis on which this project is based is the following: if the ancient economy is no doubt, according to the term of K. Polanyi, ""embedded"" in the other institutions of the social life, in particular the moral and political institutions, this integration, far from signifying the dissolution of the economy in other practical spheres, means on the contrary its practical and theoretical centrality for a large number of classical Greek and Hellenistic philosophers.",Etienne Helmer,October-November 2018,"EHESS (Paris, France)",http://www.anhima.fr/spip.php?page=recherche&amp;recherche=Helmer,,,,Ancient Greek Philosophers on Economics

The collaborative product of Boas's own observations and extensive materials authored by his long-time Indigenous co-worker George Hunt, the text was the first systematic attempt to document all sociocultural, spiritual, and aesthetic aspects of a spectacular Native North American ceremonial structure. A pioneering achievement on many levels—not least in its use of ""new"" media for ethnographic representation—it was the immediate inspiration for subsequent books, images, and museum displays, and has been the subject of an ever-lengthening list of secondary literature. Yet few readers realize the conditions under which the book was produced, which include the scramble for Northwest Coast collections, the Canadian prohibition of the potlatch, and the participation of Kwakwa ka 'wakw in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. This exhibit and symposium contribute to a collaborative project to reassemble globally distributed collections and fragmented archives, illuminate the book's history, and return long-dormant knowledge to the Indigenous families whose patrimony is represented in it. Speakers include project team members who will discuss the primary media utilized by Boas and Hunt (museum objects, texts, photographs, and wax cylinder recordings), the main sites for their ethnographic recording (fieldwork in British Columbia, the Chicago World's Fair, and museums in North America and Europe), and the legacy of the book in Kwakwa ka 'wakw communities.",Aaron Glass,02/15/2019,Bard Graduate Center,https://www.bgc.bard.edu/events/925/15-feb-2019-symposium-field,Bard Graduate Center website,,,"Symposium—Field/Fair/Museum: Franz Boas, George Hunt and the Making of Anthropology"

The committee has brought in Professor Liszka to share his work on the similarly designed Common Problem Project.  The Common Problem Project is a consortium of five State University of New York campuses, and is funded by the National Science Foundation, the State University of New York and Teagle Foundation. The purpose of the project is to promote cross-disciplinary teaching and learning, while developing problem-solving skills and civic engagement in students. Faculty from different disciplines are paired and their relevant, existing classes are coordinated to include a joint project, focused on a problem or problems of common interest. The problem can be either local, regional, or wider still. Students work in cross-disciplinary teams to devise solutions to the problem(s). Community partners and instructors serve as expert sources, but emphasis is placed on the self-direction of the learning in student teams.  The talk will give an overview of the pedagogy, practice and logistics of doing common problem projects. Several examples will be used to illustrate the variety of projects and their impact on students and communities, including SUNY Oswego's ""Good Neighbor"" project, promoting local business, the ""Sustainability in the Schools"" project at SUNY Oneonta, involving a collaboration of elementary, secondary, and college students.

Bringing together interdisciplinary perspectives, the conveners consider the role of intermediaries, border-crossers, go-betweens, and middlemen in the frictional zones between polities, where state authority begins to break down. We conceptualize these zones geographically between state territories, topographically between the lowlands of economic elites and the highlands of the political opposition, and epistemologically between knowledge systems. Through ethnographic and historical attention to the instruments of translation and bureaucratic mechanisms of flows, we hope to address the following questions: How do views from the edges of empire reorient our understanding of the center? How are terms between newcomers and natives, imperialists and indigenes navigated, negotiated, and ultimately compromised on the ground? What experimental configurations of power then emerge as a result? The conveners seek to build a comparative framework and common vocabulary in order to analyze how mediators facilitate, obstruct, and reinvent dynamics of connection and disconnection in these spaces. In doing so, they aim to trace some of the patterns in which empires are reconstituted and transformed at their edges.","Sakura Christmas, Naveena Naqvi, Alyssa Parades, Yukiko Tonoike",05/05/2019,"Yale University, New Haven CT",https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/f/396/files/2019/05/Schedule-1.jpg,Workshop Program,http://campuspress.yale.edu/interasia/events/,Yale InterAsia Initiative Event Calendar,Mediators at the Edges of Empire

My archival research of their correspondence has revealed that the so-called ""liberation of Japanese women"" during the US occupation of Japan (1945–52), rather than being invented on the spot, was instead the result of decades of collaborative labor activism by Japanese and American women. By examining how Japanese and American feminists worked together across national, cultural, and racial boundaries to improve the status of women in Japan, my research highlights a transnational network of feminists centered on the Young Women's Christian Association.

This is therefore intended not as a conference for the presentation of finished research, but as a collaborative heuristic exercise in which junior scholars will learn essential research skills and advanced scholars will gain a comparative perspective, thus enabling a deeper discussion of the modes through which textual scholarship illuminates, but also produces, objects of knowledge.

The German Max Horkheimer's Institute of Social Research and the Austrian Paul Lazarsfeld's Bureau of Applied Social Research, e.g., were both based at Columbia University, and both received support from American refugee assistance groups and influential faculty members like Robert Lynd. Like Lazarsfeld's Bureau, Horkheimer's Institute served as a refuge for many displaced scholars. But it brought with it a unique style of scholarship, Critical Theory, so peculiar that its American sponsors were not sure how to classify it: its scholars were not quite sociologists, economists, historians, psychologists, philosophers, or political scientists; rather, their method of scholarly inquiry was a hybrid of these disciplines. This unique combination of social research was ideal for the critical analysis of fascism, authoritarianism, and totalitarianism, as represented in comprehensive studies such as Studien über Autorität und Familie. The Institute itself sponsored a methodologically-related study in the American context, The Unemployed Man and His Family, by Lazarsfeld. The Institute's journal, the Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, continued to be published in German, providing a crucial resource for exiled German-speaking scholars not only in the U.S. but around the world. These research institutes were composed of exiled scholars who worked together and exchanged members, but they pursued distinct kinds of research that responded differently to the American context: the Critical Theory of the Horkheimer group attacked capitalist society, while the Lazarsfeld group embraced it.

This workshop was funded and supported through the NEH Foundation's Digital Projects for the Public Production Grant and the NC State Libraries.   Goals The vMLK Workshop at NC State was a key part of the larger NEH funded vMLK production process.  The goals of the workshop included the following:   1.  To review the production of the project components with humanities advisers, museum, library, and community partners and with interested colleagues.   2.  To assess how well the project is meeting production goals and to receive consultation and advice as we prepared for the production of the 60th anniversary of the speech exhibition in February 2020 and planned for the second year of the grant cycle.   3.  To articulate and evaluate the best practices emerging from the vMLK project and to determine how best to make those available and accessible to advisers, partners, and scholars.   Summary of Discussion/Assessment:   The vMLK project offers a model for how to think through large scale digital humanities projects (how to actually do something like this) by: 1) foregrounding theoretical rigor, 2) engaging in iterative processes for developing projects and partnerships, and 3) exploring the potential for accessibility of digital humanities projects on a variety of levels.",Victoria Gallagher and Max Renner,"September 13-14, 2019","NC State Hunt Library, Raleigh, NC USA",http://https://vmlk.chass.ncsu.edu/neh-virtual-mlk-workshop/,,,,Virtual MLK Workshop

They insisted that property in humans was ""unprofitable,"" and they did not need compensation after Confederate defeat. This narrative helped them reestablish political power and absolve themselves of four years of bloodshed and generations of enslavement.   The Dina G.

17834,FT-269949-20,"This paper reveals that debates over whether the U.S. government secured slaveowners' property rights in slaves continued after the Civil War. White southerners seceded from the U.S. in 1860-1861 to create a national government that protected their rights to own humans. Politicians and lawmakers of the time, as well as today's historians, could not agree whether the U.S. government or slave states' laws secured investments in slaves. As early as 1864, border state politicians who remained in the U.S. and southern politicians who sought re-entry into the Union challenged wartime emancipation and debated: who should pay the price of abolition?   These debates granted a new meaning to emancipation, enabling the federal government to claim control over slavery's legal and economic afterlife. Seeking federal compensation for the value of freed slaves and relief for outstanding debts for the value of slaves, these politicians argued that the U.S. Constitution protected their investments in human property and positioned widows and children as ""innocents"" who neither participated in the war nor the slave economy. Their strategy failed when the federal government nullified all claims for compensation in the Fourteenth Amendment and the U.S. Supreme Court recognized all outstanding contracts for human property in 1871.",Amanda Laury Kleintop,"March 31-April 3, 2021",Virtual,,,,,To Protect the Innocent: Abolishing Property Rights in Slaves after the Civil War
17953,FT-265433-19,"In the early twentieth century, African American women librarians in Raleigh, Atlanta, Greensboro, and other southern cities created a remarkable set of small archives that documented Black life. In Roanoke, Virginia, for example, Virginia Lee was a dedicated collector of books, ephemera, and clippings, building a ""Negro Collection"" inside the segregated Gainsboro Branch Library that today remains the largest accumulation of Africana in southwest Virginia. But like her counterparts elsewhere in the Jim Crow South, Lee operated against forbidding material and political conditions. At times she had to operate secretly, at one point even protecting the collection from a threat of destruction by white city leaders. This talk uncovers the clandestine collecting practices of Virginia Lee to show how branch libraries put record-keeping at the center of Black public life, often under threat of erasure. It argues that any theory of the Black archive must encompass not only the iconic collections in New York, Washington, or New Haven, but also the small collections, like Lee's, that prioritized local access to Black texts. The ""lady librarians"" at the center of this project were good at keeping secrets, underscoring the risks—and the radicality—of Black archive-building during and after the nadir.",Laura E.

17957,PW-264077-19,"This full day symposium features talks, discussions, and Museum displays exploring women's contributions to history in ancient Mesopotamia  In the patriarchal world of ancient Mesopotamia, women were often represented in their relation to men—as mothers, daughters, or wives—giving the impression that a woman's place was in the home. But, as we explore in this symposium, they were also authors and scholars, astute business-women, sources of expressions of eroticism, priestesses with access to major gods and goddesses, and regents who exercised power on behalf of kingdoms, states, and empires. This full-day symposium features talks, discussions, and museum displays exploring the roles and representations of women in ancient Mesopotamia.

Here is the abstract of the paper I presented:  The pessimistic meta-induction (PMI) seeks to undercut the realist's alleged connection between success and (approximate) truth by arguing that highly successful, yet wildly false theories are typical of the history of science. Realist responses to the PMI try to rehabilitate this connection by stressing various kinds of continuity between earlier and later theories. I argue that the extant realist responses are inadequate, by showing – through the example of the 19th century miasma theory of disease – that there are cases of genuinely successful, yet false theories that do not exhibit any of the required realist continuities. Moreover, I argue that this case is problematic for realists regardless of whether the miasma theory is approximately true or not.",Dana Tulodziecki,06 November 2020,"Colloquium Talk, Philosophy Department, University of Cincinnati, via Zoom (due to pandemic)",,,,,Theoretical Continuity and Approximate Truth

This workshop invites early graduate students (considering their options for research topics) to discuss the place of diversity in the region and consider topics which cross the communal and linguistic boundaries imposed on premodern history by most graduate education today.  The goal is to expose graduate students to the region's diversity early in their academic trajectory to allow them to acquire the skills necessary to pursue wide-ranging research.  The workshop will invite graduate students to discuss their potential research projects, while introducing participants to scholarly resources and evidence for exploring diversity in the medieval Middle East.  The workshop will also introduce participants to the Historical Index of the Medieval Middle East (HIMME), an NEH-sponsored digital history project to make the linguistic diversity of medieval Middle Eastern textual sources visible.

As participation in the Getty Institutes and other Digital Humanities-oriented working groups has only been available to a small number of digital practitioners, we aim to share a general overview of the work conducted at the meetings of the Digital Institutes, as well as contributions from scholars presenting a relevant short case study of their own work or thinking-in-progress. We are particularly interested in projects which address the ways that digital tools can help scholars better understand the provenance of ancient objects, as well as how this can be visualized and spatially oriented.Informal discussion of works in progress and discussions of problems of methodology are welcome, with the understanding that this is meant to be a constructive Forum for thinking through problems, rather than a formal academic presentation of any complete academic project. In addition to surveying the most recent advances in digital research relating to mapping, modeling, and analysis of ancient objects and spaces,  we hope to discuss  questions such as ""what should happen when a digital project is complete?"" and ""how can we plan for the future stewardship of digital projects - especially those with multiple authors?""

This interview discussion positions a feminist ethnographic lens on the frontlines of these epidemics to explore how Black communities in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and the U.S. South are mobilizing against historically rooted racialized and gendered injustices and receiving unprecedented public attention. The interlocutors we work with and we ourselves are renegade women in anthropology: women who conduct research on the frontlines to support Black lives, organize communities, and provide healthcare without financial and professional security. Our allyship with Black communities manifests in diverse ways. In Brazil, we fund and assemble packages with essential supplies for Black women-headed households who are battling COVID-19 while protecting their children from anti-Black police violence. In Peru, we support Black women who are faced with the choice of exposing themselves to the virus or going without food, income, or protection against violence in the home. We are deeply intertwined with Black communities in Argentina who are being denied access to the legal system. From the heart of the U.S. South, we are uncovering historical legacies of injustices and social movements while using art and technology to design a future otherwise. We are immersed in an anthropology that merges the professional with the personal; together we contribute to a conversation of what renegade women in anthropology means in times of global crisis.","Concha-Holmes, Amanda, Anderson, Judy, Main, Meredith, Lewis, Eshe",November 2020,Zoom AAA (Association of American Anthropologists) conference,,,,,Renegade Women in Anthropology at the End of the World

19389,FEL-262740-19,"In a previous article on theories of the sounding voice in China, I argued that it is only at specific historical moments, in certain kinds of discourse, and for certain kinds of purposes that the human voice is disentangled from a matrix of undifferentiated sound, often by likening the voice to other musical instruments and valorizing it above them.  In this talk, I will discuss how the rise of Kun opera (kunqu) in the sixteenth century is another such moment, when the singing voice is explicitly theorized and championed as part of a new art form emphasizing vocal virtuosity and connoisseurship within the entertainment world. To analyze the aesthetic categories and performative context of this musical discourse, I will concentrate on the writings of two key figures: Precepts of the Aria (Qulü), attributed to Wei Liangfu, the shadowy ""forefather"" of the Kun operatic style, and the personal essays of Pan Zhiheng (1556-1622), who earned the moniker ""Venerable Chronicler of Courtesans."" Pan is the most outspoken late Ming proponent for the preeminence of the human voice, for exalting an ideal of the voice (both in the most abstract and concrete ways), as something exceeding the words, something even exceeding the music, something even beyond the fusion of text and music. In the final part I will consider the larger implications of conceptualizing the voice as ""flesh,"" both in terms of late Ming claims for the power of qing (love, desire) and anthropologist Tim Ingold's suggestion that we think of ""the body ensounded"" rather than ""sound as embodied.""",judith Zeitlin,11/30/20,"Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton",,,,,‘Instrument of Flesh’: The operatic voice in late Ming and early Qing musical culture

19616,RZ-249965-16,"While some scholars still argue for a stark decline in the appearance and quality of urban life in late antiquity and the early middle ages, others have opted for a softer model of ""transition"". With this paper, through a contextualized approach, I hope to demonstrate the value of moving beyond these paradigms. Since 2014, I have excavated the coastal town site of Salapia in Apulia. The complexity of its archaeological deposits and the continued persistence of activity across different phases, has made me ever more intrigued by not just how these changes were brought about from the mid-4th to late 7th c. CE, but their impact on the community living there. As a site where we have yet to reveal any monuments, the ""unremarkable"" and ""everyday"" spaces encourage and require reconstructing patterns of daily activities to access urban experience. Even a diocese with named bishops and continued connection to the Mediterranean trading network in late antiquity did not halt the slow degradation of the urban fabric at Salapia; nor did the degradation chase away all inhabitants in a single moment. By engaging with theories of industrial ruination (Mah 2012), the material world –the slow undoing of the urban fabric itself –is foregrounded a fundamental part of the social conversation that made and remade the community at Salapia over time.     Every town is the sum of its material signature and the humans that engage and interact in and with its fabric. Nonetheless, comparing the spatial and artifactual remains from Salapia to those of other urban centers in southern Italy (Herdonia and Egnathia) better contextualizes the material choices the inhabitants made in negotiating changes that were local in character, as well as their responses to broader shifts in the Adriatic and Mediterranean ambits. Detailing this progressive decline matters because it is the making of Salapia's local history. So, too, the changes to the community there would have affected the region as a whole.","Totten, Darian Marie",February 2021,"University of Toronto, Department of Classics",,,,,Daily life in the shadow of late antique ‘decline’: urban case studies from Apulia

21221,FT-259642-18,"This presentation discusses my research on the construction of Rio de Janeiro's Casa de Correção at BRASA's conference in July 2018. My paper is based on chapter 2 of my book manuscript in which I analyze the utilization of slaves, free Africans, and prisoners to build Rio de Janeiro's Casa de Correção between 1830 and 1850. The presentation will also include a discussion of the construction of the Casa de Detenção between 1850 and 1862 using primarily free wage workers and free Africans. The research engages with two important themes of the historiography of 19th century Brazil: labor and citizenship. My analysis of the slave and free labor force used to build the penitentiary demonstrates how authorities deployed the need for inexpensive labor to control refractory elements of both enslaved and the free poor.  This was done by utilizing convicts and slave prisoners as well as vagrants summarily taken off the streets to build the Casa de Correção. I examine in particular the utilization of the construction site of the Casa de Correção as the location for keeping free Africans in protective custody between 1834 and 1864. The story of the liberated Africans at the Casa de Correção is significant because they were put to work in the construction of the prison, a measure which showed Brazil's participation in the apprenticeship labor regimes of the Atlantic in the age of abolitionism. While ostensibly discussing the construction of the penitentiary, my paper also addresses the utilization of free and enslaved workers as well as the significance of confinement in the urbanization of Rio de Janeiro in the nineteenth century. I provide a discrete analysis of the social origins of the prison population who were used as convict labor and suggests new pathways for researching the formation of Rio's working-class in the nineteenth century.",Martine Jean,07/2018,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",,,https://brasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BRASA-XIV-Program.pdf,,"Confinement, Labor, and Citizenship in the Construction of Rio’s Casa de Correção, 1830-1890,” at the Brazilian Studies Association (BRASA),"
21223,FT-259642-18,"This seminar presents research from my book manuscript entitled Routine Imprisonment: Race and Citizenship in Nineteenth Century Brazil, 1830-1890, which charts the Brazilian government's imposition of the rule of law using incarceration and involuntary labor as a mean of wrestling penal and administrative control over Rio's itinerant populations in the nineteenth-century. Tracing the decision to build the Casa de Correção in the global debates about the disciplinary benefits of confinement and the evolution of free labor ideology, the research demonstrates how Brazil's political elites envisioned adopting the penitentiary to discipline the free working class. While participating in the global debates about the inhumanity of the slave trade, philanthropists and lawmakers of both conservative and liberal strands articulated a nation-building discourse that focused on reforming Brazil's vagrants into workers in anticipation of slavery's eventual demise. In the midst of building the Casa de Correção, authorities wrestled with the tentacles of the illegal slave trade, which delivered thousands of new slaves to Brazil in open violation of the nation's laws and international treaties to curb the traffic. While traffickers traded most of the new slaves into the interior, thousands circulated in Rio and posed a pressing challenge to public order in the slave society. The police considered the presence of illegally enslaved Africans in the urban population dangerous because they were often indistinguishable from runaway slaves and their ubiquitous existence revealed the limit of state authority over the country's borders.",Martine Jean,04/2019,"Cambridge, MA",https://alari.fas.harvard.edu/event/seminar-series-apprenticeship-penal-servitude-and-precariousness-freedom,,,,"“Apprenticeship, Penal Servitude, and the Precariousness of Freedom in Nineteenth-Century Brazil”, Afro-Latin American Research Institute at the Hutchins Center, Harvard University"
21233,FT-259642-18,"Does Corporate Ownership of Bound Labor Function as a type of Total Institution? Between 1821 and 1864, the Brazilian state distributed thousands of liberated Africans to public institutions to utilize as bound laborers in public works such as railroad constructions, street paving, the repair of water fountains, foundries, prison constructions, navy and military arsenals among others. The term liberated Africans refer to the estimated 11000 slaves who were emancipated from the traffic by the Mixed Commission Court in Rio and Brazilian judicial authorities between 1821 and 1845. This is a small subset of the estimated 700 000 slaves who entered Brazil between 1831 and 1850 when the government began to actively prohibit illegal slave trading along its shores. Still, between 1850 and 1863, there were various contraband landings that resulted in the emancipation of hundreds of enslaved Africans. The consignment of liberated Africans to public institutions – and to private employers – was based on local laws and the bi-lateral treaties with England to curb the traffic between 1818 and 1835. These legal strictures submitted the emancipated to a fourteen year apprenticeship after which they could gain ""full freedom"" providing that they demonstrated their ability to live as ""free men"" and women. The document which I present here originates from my research into petitions by liberated Africans for ""full freedom"" between 1860 and 1864. The record offers a window onto the historical trajectory of corporate bound labor beyond the eighteenth-century to bring it in conversation with abolitionism and the changing labor regimes of the Atlantic, as well as research on gender, sexuality, and discipline in ""total institutions.""",Martine Jean,"June, 2019","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",https://oieahc.wm.edu/events/oi-2019-annual-conference/saturday-june-15-2019/,,,,"“Confronting Corporate Ownership of Bound Labor in Early Modern European Empires: A Primary Source Workshop” Omohundro Institute Annual Conference at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"
21234,FT-259642-18,"On March 30, 1860, Irineu Evangelista de Souza, known as Barão de Mauá, petitioned the Brazilian Government for a license to modernize Rio's system of illumination from gas to electricity. At the time, Mauá was the owner of Rio's Gas Illumination Company and Brazil's most important industrialist with investments in the country's railroad system, the Telegraph Company, docks and other infrastructures associated with modernity and incontestably vital to the ""public good."" Mauá offered to pay for the cost of placing wires around various posts in Rio's streets at his own expense to remove the dangers that resulted from the utilization of gas in public lightning. The Light Company allowed for greater security at night as it illuminated alleys and streets in the Brazilian capital. The railroad system linked Rio's harbor with the coffee producing hinterland in the transport of commodities, and the Telegraph Company eventually stringed together disparate regions while reducing the communication lines between Brazil and the North Atlantic economies.  This presentation probes how the Brazilian government facilitated Mauá's various business endeavors between 1850 and 1870 focusing on the utilization of involuntary workers, primarily liberated Africans, in placing light posts in Rio, filling the city's lamps with gas, placing railroad tracks, and maintaining the telegraph lines around the capital. The objective is to probe how entrepreneurs such as Mauá who are associated with the spirit of capitalism built projects that were premised on the notion of a ""public good"" while amassing considerable wealth that consolidated their ascent as a modern, industrialists, and political elite distinct from backward planters rooted in plantation slavery.",Martine Jean,January 2020,"New York, New York",https://aha.confex.com/aha/2020/webprogram/Session20715.html,,,,"“From Gas to Electric Illumination in Nineteenth-Century Rio de Janeiro: Liberated Africans and the Barão de Mauá’s Capitalist Ascent” in multi-session panel entitled Infrastructures of Privilege in Imperial Brazil, American Historical Association Annual"

It allowed teams to spend more time crafting their presentations through a critical, self-evaluative process that promoted deeper understanding of not only the cases, but also of team dynamics.  Although it was recognized that the asynchronous aspects of the proposed model took away some of the spontaneity inherent in the traditional face-to-face Ethics Bowl competition, participants agreed that the hybrid model for a virtual Ethics Bowl had pedagogical and technical advantages.  Going forward, it is a model worth considering, even in a post-Covid world, as it promotes outcomes difficult to achieve in a face-to-face environment, namely, greater participation (due to decreased cost) on the part of two-year colleges, as well as a heightened sense of community among two-year colleges across the country.","Ann Thebaut, Jason Frank, Greg Wright, John Garcia",10/1 - 11/20/2021,"base of operation was Santa Fe College, Gainesville, Florida; other institutions involved participated via Zoom",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f 6P3lmEeJr0PHuC EG46qtlriKrrzTL/view?usp=sharing,,,,2021 Two-Year College Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl

Boyle, most noted today for work in pneumatics, addresses the problem in more than twenty treatises spanning roughly forty years. His understanding of the forces of generation, moreover, would remain closely tied to his ideas about God and the biblical account of Creation throughout his life.  I show how Robert Boyle took up the imagery of seminal principles for religious purposes and made them cohere with his larger mechanical and experimental project. I likewise expand upon the influence that Boyle's Theological Voluntarism had upon his epistemology and methodological approach to experiment. In doing so, Boyle would contribute to a larger project of rejecting Aristotelian essentialism in favor of a modern approach to science.

During the Academy's formative period, from its inauguration in 1666 to the death of King Louis XIV in 1715, the Academy produced a wealth of images in the form of drawings, prints, medallions, and paintings, and was subject to widespread visual representation. Like England's Royal Society, the Academy was pivotal in the development of early modern natural philosophy as one of the first and best-funded scientific institutions in Europe. This project interrogates how various images and objects were created, selected, and deployed in the service of knowledge production and as a means of broadcasting monarchical power. In addition, this project accounts for the graphic and pictorial practices of both the natural philosophers, assembled in Paris by Louis XIV, and the artists with whom they regularly collaborated.

This talk offers a preliminary argument for the need to consider marriage and romantic partners in our histories more closely, as they are essential to understanding the transformations of American medicine. A true integration of this social world in our histories of health care holds the potential to radically alter our understanding of labor dynamics and the transmission of knowledge and prestige about medicine within society and culture.   At the same time, this talk will also reflect on the major methodological difficulties in documenting this domestic realm. While this history is urgent, doctors' wives have evaded the scrutiny of medical historians for a number of reasons. Not only is much of the history of medicine cataloged in the heavily curated professional papers of physicians, but partners of physicians were often heavily invested in upholding a particular image of their husbands for the public and posterity.

22243,RA-259286-18,"Aguirre-Mandujano organized and participated in this discussion of reading practices and contexts in the early Ottoman Empire, with five other scholars. His paper noted one of the most interesting examples about Ottoman reading practices that comes from a small introduction to the transliteration of a selection from Mesihi's epistolary. Mesihi was a poet and bureaucrat at the turn of the sixteenth century who compiled around a hundred letters into one single volume, the Rose of a Hundred Petals. Mesihi's work was among other compilations of Ottoman high prose.  Historian V. L. Menage notes that Mesihi's work is only mentioned in one of the sixteenth century biographical dictionaries of poets, Latifí´s Tezkiretü´l-suara —one of the most important sources for reconstructing the lives and works of early modern Ottoman poets and scholars. Latifi describes Mesihi's work as being similar to another fifteenth century manual for letter writing. The books are not at all similar, thus Menage concludes from this comparison that Latifi clearly had not seen the actual book. This remark by Menage highlights an interesting, if unintended point: how little we know about how Ottoman learned men talked about books, even when they might not have read them. In my work, I argue that knowing and talking about books and literary works did not always required physical reading and study, or even seeing the actual book. In this roundtable, I will focus on biographical dictionaries of poets and discuss what they tell us about practices of reading and not reading. I will raise two points for consideration: First, the access, use, and management of information required for the creation of the biographical dictionaries. Second, what practices of knowing (oral, communal, book reading) can be seen when reading biographical dictionaries, poems, and introductions to literary works that shed light on how Ottomans talked about books.",Oscar Aguirre-Mandujano,"November 29, 2021","online, Middle East Studies Association Meeting, November 2021",https://mesana.org/pdf/MESA2021.pdf,"program of the 55th annual meeting of the Middle East Studies Association, November 29 - December 3, 2021, page 23.",,,Roundtable:  Reading Practices and Contexts in the Early Ottoman Empire

22286,HB-273677-21,"Abstract  This paper provides a descriptive analysis of bilingual language across online platforms by island youth. We provide findings of 2 social networks (Milroy and Llamas, 2013) of Puerto Ricans and qualitatively detail how different technological platforms provide different ideological spaces for communication and the construction of identities, whereby ideological practices exist each matching expected audiences and ideologies attached to virtual spaces. Individuals, in turn, orient to these platforms and their imagined audiences through a diverse range of semiotic practices. In this sense, we project the image of an island bilingual that is strategic, multimodal and literate in different Englishes, Spanishes and in-between contact styles. Furthermore, we position the Puerto Rican Internet user as stylistically engaging in two competing ideological linguistic markets: that of Global Englishes (encompassing standard and non-standard varieties of English) as well as Global Spanish (encompassing Puerto Rican Spanish, standard Spanish, and features of Internet Spanish).   Data are gathered from popular social media applications (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) as well as text-messaging applications (WhatsApp, iMessage), for a total of 500 screenshots.

22287,HB-273677-21,"Roundtable proposal: Sense-making in the Bilingual Oral History Interview   Czeslaw Milosz once wrote that ""language is the only homeland."" Milosz' words ring particularly true in contexts of displacement, where language comes to act as a potent symbol of belonging and identity.   This roundtable honors this facet of migrant identity by discussing how ""movements"" across languages during oral history interviews can be interpreted. Based on three English-Spanish oral history projects, respectively recorded in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Argentina, presenters will discuss how participants' movements from one language to another illuminated an understanding of their migration journeys.   Sarah O'Brien will draw from fifty interviews recorded with third generation Irish descendants in Argentina (2010-2012). Her presentation will problematize the role of language in diasporic contexts by illustrating how racist discourses in nineteenth century Argentina encouraged the English language maintenance amongst successive generations of Irish-Argentine descendants. Alejandra Nuñez will approach this topic from the perspective of Mexican migration. Referencing 23 oral histories recorded with bilingual transnational youths in Mexico, she will illustrate how focusing on language-use as a discussion point during the oral history interview empowered participants to reflect upon their development of a transnational identity [...]  Katherine Morales' presentation addresses the narratives of identity and belonging that emerged through bilingual practices in a series of ethnographic oral history interviews conducted in a public school in Puerto Rico. The English language in this setting is considered a symbol of prestige, unequally distributed among the masses. By adopting a heteroglossic (see Bakhtin)  framework, this presentation highlights how transnational adolescents made sense of their cultural and social realities, by strategically drawing on the linguistic repertoires.","Katherine Morales, Sarah O'Brien, Alejandra Nunez",October 9-14 2021,Annual Oral History Conference [Virtual presentation],https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/oha/oha21/,,,,Making Sense of Bilingual Histories

Presentations will later be developed as essays and collected into a volume to be published with Bloomsbury.  Since at least the European Enlightenment, the core topics of western philosophy of religion have consisted of the nature and existence of God, the problem of evil, and the immortality of the soul. These topics are implicitly taken as natural or rational, even used in some cases as the fundamental categories for global philosophy of religion. Witness, for example, the multi-million-dollar ""Global Philosophy of Religion Project"" recently funded by the John Templeton Foundation at the University of Birmingham, which deploys the categories of existence and nature of deities, death and immortality, and evil and suffering in the world ""to make progress on central issues in the philosophy of religion by incorporating multi-religious perspectives"" (https://www.global-philosophy.org/projects). But what if philosophy of religion had begun in some other place or at some other time? Would its core categories of inquiry resemble those of contemporary western philosophy of religion?  This mini-conference and essay collection addresses these questions, exploring what the core topics (as well as the methods and aims) of philosophy of religion might have been (or actually were or are) in socio-historical contexts, religio-philosophical traditions, and methodological-theoretical orientations other than contemporary, western philosophy of religion (especially in its analytic mode). In doing so this volume of essays challenges the implicit claim that the core topics of western philosophy of religion are somehow natural or rational and therefore well-suited for global philosophy of religion.

We acknowledge that moral wounds are in complex relationship with perpetrators, victims and witnesses. Our approach uses humanties texts such as comics, poems and historical plays, as an entry point to discuss the spiritual and ethical dimensions of service and betrayal. With the help of facilitators, participants may choose to ""act"" a short scene that contains a familiar moral wound. This will be followed by a structured discussion. Reading the stories out loud allows participants to enact emotions through the characters, offering cover from personal exposure. The visceral experience, for both ""actor"" and audience allows for a greater depth of dialogue around these wounds. In our experience, this creates a strong sense of belonging through collective suffering and opportunities for communal repair. With special techniques that ensure success with the unfamiliar language, participants are guided through the powerful poetry and stories of Shakespeare and the multidimensional graphic storytelling of comics. Following the participatory performance and dialogue demonstration, we will discuss how the method and tools might provide people with opportunities to co-create new language around moral repair.

Program: The Warriors Path: War, Moral Injury and Reclaiming the Soul is a National Endowment for the Humanities funded program that used military comics to develop a moral injury lexicon for women Veterans with military sexual trauma. Approach: The discussion group used graphic novels, comics, poetry, prose, and art to facilitate discussions of moral injury (MI) in the context of ageism, disability, ethnicity, gender neutrality, homophobia, marital/relationship status, national origin, racism, religion, sexism, socio-economic class, and many other topics. Results: Several Women Veterans identified institutional betrayal, familial betrayal, military training, lack of post-deployment recuperation period, as their primary MI. All participants agreed liked using humanities-based formats to help them dig deeper and reframe the social injustice they experienced.

In the mid-1990s, a crazy-haired teacher named Ms. Frizzle took children on field trips inside the human body and to the outer reaches of space. The Magic School Bus was a centerpiece experiment to reinvigorate American science education that became a global phenomenon. The television series' catchphrase, ""Take Chances! Make Mistakes! Get Messy!"" suggested new ways of getting children excited about science. In contrast to a white-coated man performing demonstrations, the show used cartoon animation to help viewers experience science in action and to allowed the children to venture into unreachable environments and imagined worlds. Along the way, Ms. Frizzle encouraged kids to take risks, to fail, and to find patterns. Beyond its pedagogical innovations, The Magic School Bus was an experiment in how to pay for the technoscientific future. The show resulted from a public-private ""synergy"" between government agencies, commercial publishers and broadcasters, high tech companies, and even McDonald's. It combined science education with CD-ROM software, a traveling show, and a clothing line. In this talk, I use The Magic School Bus to analyze ""edutainment"" and science education reform in the late-20th century.

Over the last decade, these tools can now help assist in the production of texts from medieval manuscripts at previously unobtainable levels of accuracy. Today, libraries have used these tools to make their collections searchable, while researchers have sped up the process of creating editions of texts and adopted them for the study of medieval documents.  The course will offer an introduction into some of these ongoing projects, but more importantly provide an introduction into the practice of studying medieval documents with Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technologies. The course will have two main parts: 4 online sessions and a three-day in person workshop in Vienna. During the first phase, participants will be introduced to both the theory of handwritten text recognition and its practical application using the Transkribus (transkribus.eu) tool. We will then work in four groups, focusing on four different periods and languages: Carolingian Latin, late medieval Latin, late medieval German, and late medieval Czech. Each group will have its own supervisor and its goal will be to train an HTR model for each type of writing.  During the in-person workshop in Vienna, we will finalize the four projects and publish our results online: both the transcriptions and Handwritten Text Recognition models. Additionally, we will also visit libraries in Vienna to see selected manuscripts in person.

For more than three decades, Yahuda made his living as a manuscript dealer, buying rare Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts and selling them to libraries and collectors in Europe and North America, including the British Museum, the Irish-American collector Cheater Beatty, Princeton University, the University of Heidelberg, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the U.S. Army Medical College (now the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland). At the end of his life, he bequeathed his remaining collection to the National Library of Israel, including the archive of Isaac Newton.
