21,RZ-50577-06,"This comparative study of late nineteenth century Britain and France examines regional and local patterns of rural change in relation to the expansion of railways, the agrarian crisis, and the responses to the crisis by the governments and farmers of the two countries.  Using spatial statistics and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to identify spatially varying relationships in case studies of Dorset County in England and the Allier Department in France, it shows that railways facilitated the shift from cereal production to livestock and dairy farming during the era of agrarian crisis. More broadly, it concludes that the differing political economies of Britain and France led to different trade and railway policies during the crisis and to different agrarian outcomes in which agricultural productivity declined in Britain and improved in France.",,Robert M.

22,RZ-50577-06,"This comparative spatial history combines historical narrative, geographical thinking, and spatial analysis of historical data to offer new perspectives on railway expansion and its effects in France and Great Britain during the long nineteenth-century. After describing the expansion across time and state territories, it looks not to cities but to the countryside to gauge some economic and social effects of railways in the rural regions of the countries.  Accessible rail transport opened new economic opportunities in agriculture, extractive industries, and service trades. It helped revitalize rural communities favored by ready rail access and reduced their rates of out migration.  In France, long-standing economic disparities between the developed north and the less-productive south were gradually reduced. In making the argument, we apply historical GIS and spatial statistics, illustrating one new component of interdisciplinary spatial history.",,"Thomas Thevenin, Robert M. Schwartz, Ian N.

This article argues that yakuza and the state were able to join forces in part because they were operating in a world in which the boundaries between the legitimate and the illegitimate were fluid and porous.  Struggling to define these boundaries were leftist intellectuals who took a critical stance against non-state political violence, yet reinforced the legitimacy of state violence.

173,FB-55046-10,"This paper focuses on a particular event in South African history and the ways in which the event is memorialized and remembered in post-apartheid South Africa.  In her book Visual Culture and Public Memory in a Democratic South Africa, Annie Coombes remarks, ""Women's vital role in the overthrow of the apartheid state has been sorely neglected in favor of a more monolithic representation of the liberation movement"" (107).    In this paper I consider Coombes' claim in relation to one specific attempt at public memorial after apartheid: the Monument to the Women of South Africa located at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.   As the only commemorative site dedicated entirely to women's apartheid-era political efforts, the Monument to the Women of South Africa is of vital importance to the memory of women's role in the struggle. And yet a tension exists between the monument's presence as a feminist site, and its disappearance from public view: the Monument has essentially been invisible to the public for most of its existence, due in part to the inaccessibility of the Union Buildings.  The Monument's invisibility not only trivializes the political significance of the Women's March, but is also a distressing act of post-apartheid erasure of women's political agency.  I argue that when one considers this alongside the more widespread exclusion of women in post-apartheid commemorative sites, this not only has implications for the telling of history, but may very well affect women's ability to in Cynthia Enloe's words, ""sustain an authentic political life in post-war periods"" (71).

The state of Kansas was charging them with forty murders in the last ""Indian Raid"" in Kansas. In 1877, the government had ordered all Northern Cheyennes to move to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma, which most had found intolerable. A group of about three-hundred Northern Cheyenne men, women, and children escaped in September of 1878 and finally were imprisoned at Camp Robinson in Nebraska. After an attempt to break free on January 9, 1879, more than a dozen men remained alive.  The U.S. Army authorities sent a few prisoners to the Pine Ridge Agency, and seven Northern Cheyenne men arriving in Dodge City faced Ford County charges. While in Dodge, this group created four ledger notebooks, which they bartered or sold. The images they created include many game animals, female animals with young, groupings of men and/or women, and local wildlife. Few images of war or warriors occur. Implicitly, these texts record the remarkable recovery and adaptation of seven men who experienced extreme hardships and loss.

Although the topic is well-studied in many Western contexts, historical and contemporary, we still know little about the ways in which socioeconomic disparities and class identities were transmitted across subsequent generations of parents and children in the Ottoman Empire. In order to explore this issue in a sophisticated fashion, this article introduces quantitative techniques and categories of analysis tailored specifically for Ottoman sources. In addition to other findings, our analysis suggests that Kastamonu in the eighteenth century was vertically and horizontally segmented: Not only were there significant impediments to intergenerational mobility across privileged and underprivileged sectors of the society, such transitions were also infrequent across sub-groups within upper and lower classes. Despite a general lack of intergenerational fluidity at all socioeconomic levels, however, our calculations also reveal that the provincial elite were particularly immobile.",,"Kaygun, Atabey, Ergene, Bogac",Journal,History of the Family,,,,,,Intergenerational Mobility in the in the Ottoman Empire:  Observations from Eighteenth-Century Kastamonu,2011

299,FO-50116-10,"Political economists have long noted that the prospects for trade liberalization diminish in a climate of economic recession. A stagnant economy intensifies the burden of adjustment for non-competitive sectors and polarizes domestic trade politics. Not surprisingly, the global financial crisis has raised concerns of a substantial protectionist backlash, through the imposition of national measures that circumvent WTO disciplines such as anti-dumping or tied stimulus packages. The impact of economic crisis on regional integration is, however, more ambiguous and has not been explored systematically. On the one hand, policymakers may be pressed to renege on trade liberalization commitments on all fronts -weakening as well the momentum to negotiate or implement regional trade agreements (FTAs). On the other hand, policymakers may be tempted to ""insulate"" their region from adverse global trends and may see FTAs as more amenable to political manipulation that shelters inefficient sectors. In order to shed light on the connection between external crisis and regionalist drive, I assess three main challenges East Asian elites confront in devising a regional trade bloc capable of acting as a growth locomotive: institutional fit, multilateralization, and architectural design. The track record of East Asian governments of negotiating FTAs to score diplomatic points abroad and ensure political survival at home–at the expense of maximizing economic gains through far-reaching liberalization- does not bode well for the magnitude of this challenge.",,Mireya Solis,Journal,The Pacific Review,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09512748.2011.577232?prevSearch=solis&amp;searchHistoryKey=,,,,,"Global Economic Crisis: Boon or Bust for East Asian Trade Integration?

300,FO-50116-10,"Japan's response to the global financial crisis has emphasized global initiatives and downplayed the regional agenda, in sharp contrast to its approach to the Asian Financial Crisis. This rebalancing in Japan's economic diplomacy reflects the greater political space it enjoys at the global level since its long held views on the benefits of flexible IMF lending practices and controls on volatile capital flows have now become mainstream; while at the regional level Japan faces stiff competition with China in shaping the regional integration agenda and unchartered territory in co-leading a multilateralized Chiang Mai Initiative. Despite its enhanced profile, Japan's new globalism is uneven: it has made a very significant financial contribution to expand the resources of the IMF and to restore trade financing; but Japan has not played a major role in the debate surrounding the most pressing issues of a future financial architecture such as tackling global imbalances and promoting foreign exchange rate cooperation. Japan's muted voice, despite its large financial commitments, is due to its difficult adaptation to the G20 summitry process as well as political volatility at home which prevents developing measures to deal with global downturn.",,Mireya Solis,Journal,The Hague Journal of Diplomacy,http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mnp/hjd/2011/00000006/F0020001/art00003,,,,,"Globalism ascendant, regionalism stagnant: Japan’s response to the global financial crisis",2011

346,RA-50003-03,"Following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt and the Levant in 1516-17, administrators of the empire began to experiment with several innovative strategies to increase the total volume of the spice trade between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean, and to maximize the state's share of its revenues. These became progressively more sophisticated over time, until by the end of the 1560s a comprehensive infrastructure was in place, including a rationalized empire-wide tax regime for regulating private trade, a network of ""imperial factors"" who bought spices for the sultan in overseas emporiums, and an annual convoy of spice galleys that shipped cargoes of state-owned pepper from the Yemen to the markets of Egypt and Istanbul. All of this, combined with natural advantages of geography and the goodwill of Muslim traders in the Indian Ocean, enabled the Ottomans to mount a formidable challenge to the ""pepper monopoly"" of the Portuguese Estado da India.",,"Casale, Giancarlo",Journal,Journal of Economic and Social History of the Orient,,,,,,The Ottoman Administration of the Spice Trade in the Sixteenth Century Red Sea and Persian Gulf,2006

And yet, while modern scholars have been aware of this sea change in global commerce for generations, the reasons behind it still remain a subject of debate. Numerous explanations have been proposed, ranging from changes in the international demand for spices to corruption within the Portuguese administration. Until now, however, none has taken into account what may be the most important factor of all: the rising power of Ottoman corsairs, whose predatory raids against Portuguese targets were instrumental in subverting the Estado da India's system for controlling trade in the western Indian Ocean.",,"Casale, Giancarlo",Journal,Itinerario,,,,,,Ottoman Guerre de Course and the Intercontinental Spice Trade,2008

During the first century of colonization, the visual identification of members of ethnoracial categories—indios, mestizos, mulattos, negros, and Spaniards—transformed over time and space in the Atlantic context. I argue in this article that we may be confining ourselves to a conceptual straitjacket if we limit our interpretation of terms like ""indio"" or ""mulato"" to their ethnic or racial dimensions as part of a self-enclosed system of classification, because such usages were embedded in broader schemes of perception and categorization that both antedated the Spanish invasion of the Americas and continued to be employed on the Iberian Peninsula. In particular, ethnoracial categories interacted in a complex relationship with the ways that observers reacted to the physiognomy of the individuals who bore these labels, so that the fluidity of classification can be seen as deriving in part from the interpretation of visual cues.",,Joanne Rappaport,Journal,Hispanic American Historical Review,,,,,,"“Asi lo paresce por su aspeto"": Physiognomy and the Construction of Difference in Colonial Bogotá ",2011

Previous attempts at explaining this paradox have erred either in deemphasizing the devastating personal and communal costs of impressment or by stressing that the navy's oppressive system of discipline left sailors with no choice but to serve admirably. In fact, sailors exercised their agency both by resisting British press-gangs and by serving to the best of their ability on naval vessels. The British navy created incentives that appealed to mariners' professional self-interests and male gender aspirations.

562,HD-51209-10,"The Oracle performance takes place partially in real space, and partially in virtual space.  (see ""Preamble"", above.) The task is to overlay a soundscape onto a physical space to match the projected visual.  More precisely, we wish to create a unified aural space that extends from the physical through the virtual to encompass the entire performance. The aural contributions come in the form of the ambience, puppeteer, actor and the audience. The ambient music and effects would serve as the base on which the additional sounds would be placed to enhance realism. The additional sounds would be a mix of the sound of the puppeteer, actor and the audience all channeled through separate microphones. The fidelity of the sonic space would further need to be enhanced with the addition of specialized sound effects such as echo, reverb, etc to make the space more believable to the audience. The inclusion of different reverbs for different spaces would be the first major addition and also the most psychologically impactful. The changes in reverb would immediately allow the audience to discern the transition from a big space to a small one or from an open space to a closed one.  Integration of sound with space would not be the only task at hand. Sound must also gel with the performance and hit cues with the actors to provide a sense of realism. Automation of sound is a core goal of this project. However, in a real time project with live actors, automation of sound has certain limitations, which is why an operator to regulate live sounds was deemed necessary. Further efforts would be put in to automate these tasks in future to make the system more self-reliant.

10423,FA-57352-13,"Epistemology is, at least in part, a normative discipline.   Epistemologists are concerned not simply with what people believe, how confident they are, or the conditions under which they believe it or are so confident.  They are also – and more interestingly – concerned with what people should believe, how confident they should be, and the conditions under which they should believe it and be so confident.  But epistemology is, paradigmatically, the study of knowledge.  Is knowledge itself a normative concept?  Or is it merely normatively important?  This question, I believe, is of fundamental importance for the appropriate methodology in the theory of knowledge, for it tells us whether the theory of knowledge is a special case of normative inquiry more generally, or whether we can instead study knowledge without needing to pay attention to how our answers fit in with the study of normative properties and relations.

10442,HB-50471-14,"This paper explores the relationship between the problem of evil and a kenotic view of the Atonement evidenced not just by feminist theologians, but by analytic philosophers of religion. (""Kenosis"", from the Greek ????s??, ""emptiness,"" generally refers to the emptying of the self, and more specifically refers to the passion of Christ, during which Christ suffered on behalf of humanity.) I will argue that, although kenosis provides an interesting story about the ability of Christ to partake in human suffering, it faces debilitating problems for understanding divine concurrence with evil in the world. Most significantly, I will argue that the potential tensions between divine justice (in holding wrong- doers responsible) and divine love (for those who suffer) can be loosened by looking at ‘redemptive accounts' of theodicy in the scholarship of women writing in the early modern period in philosophy, particularly Mary Hays (1759–1843), and Catharine Macaulay (1731–1791).1 Their work collectively confirms the problem of concrete evil (that is, not just that evil must be logically possible in order for God to create the best possible world, but that atrocious harms are pernicious to a perfectly existing necessary being) and yet offers a unique theodicy grounded in the saving power of the Atonement and restorative power of Christian service. Their arguments are all the more compelling for having been written in response to egregious civil rights abuses and rampant domestic violence of their day. If the Atonement is the divinely-ordained method for gaining insight into the redemptive power of divine grace, then rather than speculating about the metaphysical nature of the divine, this paper will question how we can understand divine perfection in light of evil in the world, especially if the Atonement of Christ involves kenosis.","Subscription, some free access",Jill Graper Hernandez,Journal,Philosophia,http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/608/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11406-014-9568-0.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11406-014-9568-0&amp;token2=exp=1469035312~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F608%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs11406-014-956,"Springer's ""Philosophia"" website",Philosophia (a Springer journal),,,Acquainted with Grief: the Atonement and Early Modern Conceptions of Kenosis,2015

10444,HB-50471-14,"In the health care professions, the meaning of—and implications for—‘dignity' and ‘value' are progressively more important, as scholars and practitioners increasingly have to make value judgments when making care decisions. This paper looks at the various arguments for competing sources of human value that medical professionals can consider—human rights, autonomy, and a higher-order moral value—and settles upon a foundational model that is related to (though distinct from) the Kantian model that is popular within the medical community: human value is foundational; human dignity, autonomy, and rights derive from the relational quality of human dignity. Moral dignity is expressed though the relationships we cultivate, the communal ends we pursue, and the rights we enjoy. Correlatively, human dignity is inseparable from its ground (i.e., morality), and the relationship between these two is best represented for Kant in the humanities formulation. The foundational model of dignity ensures that human value is non-circularly derived, but is ultimately tied to expressions of individual human dignity that comes from the dignity of morality. Linking Kant's dignity of humanity to the dignity of morality affords a unique and efficacious response to the discussion of human value. In one sense, dignity is amplificatory, since its worth is inextricable with that of autonomy and the rights afforded to the autonomous. But that isn't to say that the worth of dignity is merely amplificatory. Rather, human dignity indicates the absolute inner value (MM 6:435) found in each individual in virtue of being human (MM 6:435, 462). That inner worth engenders certain universal rights—derivable from the dignity and fundamental rational appeal of morality—just as it provides for the possibility for a community of beings to seek to live the moral life.",subscription,Jill Graper Hernandez,Journal,HealthCare Ethics Community (HEC) Forum (Springer),http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10730-015-9271-y,Springer's HEC Forum webpage to article.,HealthCare Ethics Community (HEC) Forum (Springer),,,"Human Value, Dignity, and the Presence of Others",2015
10446,FA-52531-06,"Building on Quilligan's discussion of the female perspective in Book III of The Faerie Queene, Berger's emphasis on ""conspicuous allusion,"" and De Laurretis's notion of ""technologies of gender,"" this talk focuses on ""technologies of desire"" in Spenser's Legend of Chastity. These include discourses but also other media—representational apparatuses of all sorts that evoke erotic feeling and shape it as experience and as expression.  Spenser's concern with such technologies surfaces immediately in the proem, as it mirrors (and foreshadows) the Busyrane episode, and later in an allegory that seeks to represent representation along with the damage it can do, as images, objects, creatures, and characters disappear from the narrated action, quite literally absorbed into discourse. Against the pervasive harm of unchaste discourse, Spenser poses on the one hand a utopian fantasy of untrammeled freedom in erotic address, and on the other a visionary quest for the ungesehenmachen (""making-unhappened"") of the amorous discourses dominant in Elizabethan literature, staged as a re-virgination of the culture's erotic imagination. These concerns re-emerge in Amoretti and Epithalamion and carry over into the 1596 installment of The Faerie Queene, where Scudamore appears as a failed counterpart to the poet-speaker of Spenser's sonnet sequence and marriage poem.

10450,FA-52531-06,"How could Spenser have written a poem as inexplicably bad as Daphnaida, and why did he publish it? Having done so once, in 1591, why did he then republish the poem, unrevised, in 1596? And having published it the first time solus, why in 1596 did he republish it as a companion piece to the highly accomplished Fowre Hymnes? This essay proposes speculative answers to all three questions. Daphnaida is deliberately bad and indeed advertises itself as such, explicitly banishing the Horatian pair utile et dulce in its opening stanzas. This may be the form Spenser's resistance took if he was prevailed upon by Sir Walter Ralegh to write an elegy proclaiming Arthur Gorges's inconsolable grief for his young wife as part of a campaign to gain control over her estate. This explanation holds for the republication in 1596, when Ralegh had been rehabilitated at court and Gorges was pursuing the wardship of his daughter Ambrosia, but it fails to explain the pairing of Daphnaidai with Fowre Hymnes. That is explained by reading Fowre Hymnes as a revisionary take on Petrarch's Trionfi: a generalized work of mourning for all created things, but one from which the motivating event of Laura's death has been elided. Daphnaida, written in the same stanza as the Hymnes, offers their precise reverse: a death so particularized and definitive that all mourning for it is summarily refused. Together the poems complicate and resituate each other as radically alternative versions of the same underlying recognition, namely that hatred for the world is ultimately a false posture.&#x0D; &#x0D; Spenser Studies: A Renaissance Poetry Annual, Volume XXVI, pp 241–250&#x0D; &#x0D; Copyright 2011 AMS Press, Inc.

10451,FN-50009-06,"In the Bantu languages of Kikisi, Kindendeule and Chingoni, the subjunctive is a grammatical category that stands in contrast with the indicative mood. Morphologically, the subjunctive is characterized by the verbal suffix –e (or some other variants), absence of tense marking, and the obligatory presence of the subject and/or object marker. Two types of subjunctive are illustrated (Quer 2005; Stowell 1993): (i) Intentional subjunctives that are triggered by matrix predicates, and (ii) polarity subjunctives that are licensed by some operator. The subjunctive is associated with irrealis-inducing environments such as irrealis-inducing adverbs and complements of manipulative verbs (Givón 1994). This paper argues that the subjunctive ambiguously exhibits Inflection or Tense features as well as COMP features. With respect to Inflection features, it is in complementary distribution with tense marking. However, it displays COMP features in its selectional relations with the superordinate volitional and directive predicates. This ambiguity is accounted for if we adopt Rizzi's (1997) proposal of an articulated CP.

These include a gap in the embedded construction, island effects and licensing of parasitic gaps. In addition, the construction exhibits other characteristics found in Bantu finite relative clauses, namely, verb-subject inversion in object relatives and resumption. The article addresses the question of head raising analysis revived by Kayne (1994). With evidence from idiom chunks and reconstruction, it is argued that the head of the infinitival relative is extracted from inside an infinitival clause. Finally, an analysis parallel to that of finite relative clauses is proposed.

Because the measurement of similarity is typically composed of a number of metrics, and some measures are sensitive to subjective interpretation, a generic detector obtained using machine learning often has difficulties balancing the roles of different metrics according to the semantic context exhibited in a specific collection of texts. In order to facilitate human interaction in a visual analytics process for text similarity detection, we first map the problem of pairwise sequence comparison to that of image processing, allowing patterns of similarity to be visualized as a 2D pixelmap. We then devise a visual interface to enable users to construct and experiment with different detectors using primitive metrics, in a way similar to constructing an image processing pipeline. We deployed this new approach for the identification of commonplaces in 18th-century literary and print culture.

Several explanations are offered here including the roots of environmental economic theory in the theory of externalities, economists' fascination with the interesting and challenging theoretical puzzle posed by the theorem, and the normative and ideological thrust that permeated discussions of the theorem, both within and outside the field of environmental economics.",,Steven G.

10517,FB-55611-11,"The ‘Coase theorem' has long been the idea most commonly associated with Ronald&#x0D; Coase's analysis in «The Problem of Social Cost».

Though virtually all of the discussion in decades following the publication&#x0D; of «The Problem of Social Cost» focused on Coase's negotiation result, the&#x0D; fact is that Coase's message was not, at the start, misunderstood. This paper takes up&#x0D; a number of the treatments of «The Problem of Social Cost» in the years immediately&#x0D; following its publication to demonstrate that Coase's emphasis on the reciprocal nature&#x0D; of externalities, the importance of transaction costs, the possibility of merger solutions,&#x0D; the costs associated with state action, and the need for a comparative institutional&#x0D; approach were anything but lost on these early commentators.

This early engagement also made&#x0D; him responsible—both directly, through his writings, and indirectly, through his&#x0D; students and others influenced by his writings—for much of the early diffusion&#x0D; of the Coase theorem in legal literature. Calabresi was a legal scholar with&#x0D; roots in both economics and legal realism who was enamored of the potential&#x0D; power of Coase's result as he (Calabresi) interpreted it—an interpretation in&#x0D; certain ways radically different from Coase's own conception of his negotiation&#x0D; result—even if not convinced of its real-world applicability.

10568,FB-51967-05,"In this paper I outline and defend an introspectionist account of&#x0D; authoritative self-knowledge for a certain class of cases, ones in which a subject is&#x0D; both thinking and thinking about a current, conscious thought. My account is distinctive&#x0D; in a number of ways, one of which is that it is compatible with the truth of&#x0D; externalism—the view that the contents of subjects' intentional states are individuation-&#x0D; dependent on factors external to their minds. It is thus decidedly anti-&#x0D; Cartesian, despite being introspectionist. My argument proceeds in three stages. A&#x0D; virtue of the position I develop is that the epistemic features on which it is based&#x0D; also apply to sensations and to non-episodic intentional states, to the extent that one&#x0D; has authoritative knowledge of them. However, despite the appeal to analogies with&#x0D; observable properties of objects of perception, the account is not a ‘perceptual'&#x0D; model of such knowledge in the sense that those such as Shoemaker, Burge and&#x0D; others have in mind. Because the features on which the analogy is based are abstract&#x0D; and general, they are not tied to cases of observation alone. Those who appeal to&#x0D; such phenomena as ‘intellectual experience' (Burge, Proceedings of the Aristotelian&#x0D; Society, 96, 91–116, 1996) or ‘intellectual intuition' (Bealer, Philosophical perspectives,&#x0D; Cambridge, MA: Basil Blackwell, 29–55, 1999) in their accounts of&#x0D; authoritative self-knowledge may well appeal to such features.

It does so by examining the institutional and archival history of a court known as the Chaudrie in the French colony of Pondichéry in India in the eighteenth century, and integrating problems that are specific to the study of legal history—questions pertaining to jurisdiction, codification, evidence, and sovereignty—with issues all historians face regarding power and the making of archives. Under French rule, Pondichéry was home to multiple judicial institutions, administered by officials of the French East Indies Company. These included the Chaudrie court, which existed at least from 1700 to 1827 as a forum where French judges were meant to dispense justice according to local Tamil modes of dispute resolution. However, records of this court prior to 1766 have not survived. By drawing on both contemporaneous mentions of the Chaudrie and later accounts of its workings, this study centers missing or phantom sources, severed from the body of the archive by political, judicial, and bureaucratic decisions. It argues that the Chaudrie was a court where jurisdiction was decoupled from sovereignty, and this was the reason it did not generate a state-managed and preserved archive of court records for itself until the 1760s.

20826,FT-265390-19,"This paper examines the ways that disaster risk information and communication is received, shared, and acted upon by deaf-led organizations in Vi?t Nam, and the nature of deaf organizational participation in disaster risk reduction initiatives. Global indexes rank Vi?t Nam as the 6th highest country in exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events. Vi?t Nam also demonstrates a high incidence of people with disabilities per capita, who are shown to have lower levels of participation in all social domains including public information and communication. Conducting language-centered original ethnographic research in six deaf organization sites in northern, central, and southern Vi?t Nam, this study engaged semi-structured interviews, group surveys, participant-generated disaster drawings and photographs, and participant observation to identify disaster communication and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) practices and challenges. Research findings identified: (i.) deaf people's access to DRR information and communication is extremely limited leading deaf-led organizations to mobilize their own disaster action; (ii.) deaf people have little-to-no access to DRR training, and available training does not reflect deaf culture or local sign languages; (iii.) deaf organizations attribute lack of access to disaster information and resources to government inattention to deaf community needs and contributions; (iv.) deaf organizations share a strong sense of responsibility to train and protect the broader deaf community. Foregrounding recommendations by deaf organization leaders, the paper advocates for establishing sustainable mechanisms for engaging deaf-led organizations in developing disaster communication, DRR training, and in disaster management.",Subscription only,"Audrey C Cooper, Huong Thanh Th?

I offer a synchronic analysis of these finite embedded clauses and propose a specific grammaticalization pathway that can account for their diachronic emergence: the clausal nominalizer hè developed out of a homophonous third person pronoun, allowing for paratactic constructions to be reanalyzed as involving true subordination. Both functions of hè (as a pronoun and as a clausal nominalizer) remain in use today, giving rise to occasional ambiguity. An additional aim of this paper is to evaluate the Tuparí facts in light of the literature on the Final-over-Final Condition (FOFC), a proposed syntactic universal. I will show that the language's embedded clauses are unexpected on the most restrictive formulation of FOFC (Holmberg 2000) but can be accommodated without issue once FOFC is restricted to apply within Extended Projections.

Further, the literature on group knowledge until now has primarily focused on limited, specialized groups that may be said to know this or that as a group. I wish to argue, to the contrary, that all knowledge-attributions ascribe a collective status; and that this follows more or less directly from an essential function of entitlement-ascriptions: Ascriptions of knowledge and entitlement serve a primarily social function in that they facilitate coordination by maintaining consensus around true beliefs, true theories, and truth-producing methodologies. This conclusion will shed light on ways in which traditional theories of knowledge (such as foundationalism and coherentism) fail to capture a central function of our epistemic practice.",in print and on line,Jeremy Koons,Journal,Analytic Philosophy,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phib.12224,,Analytic Philosophy  (Wiley),,,"“Knowledge as a Collective Status,”",2021

21037,FEL-268275-20,"This article explores the formation of what Christopher Hamlin has called a ""forensic culture"" in late nineteenth-century Japan, and its impact on the prosecution of crimes of sexual violence. Before the 1870s, acts of rape often went unpunished or were resolved through private monetary settlements between the victim and her family and the rapist. However, after the formation of the modern Japanese state in 1868, legal reform, an important aspect of the state-building process, created a new opportunity for victims to seek legal redress. Over the course of a decade, an unprecedented number of rapes were prosecuted, with most resulting in convictions and long prison terms for the perpetrators. That situation, however, changed as forensic medicine came to be institutionalized as a specific medical discipline and as part of the criminal justice system. Viewed by the police and jurists as modern, scientific, and rational, forensic medicine created a new standard for what counted as evidence, with the result that the testimony of the victim and others was devalued in favor of traces of blood, semen, and bodily injury—evidence that, as some contemporaries noted, ignored the reality of rape.",Subscription,Susan L.

21054,RQ-50735-13,"For more than three decades, the study of texts usually called « Franco-Italian » has undergone a renaissance. The majority of works concerned, written between the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century in northeast Italy, are chansons de geste, and continue French epic tradition. Not only are they characterized by an artificial and hybrid language, which includes elements from the langue d'oïl and Italian dialects, but also by a different way of viewing the world, a way that subtly alters the world-image derived from chansons de geste. The explicit desire of Franco-Italian epic poets to include themselves in a truth-bearing French literary tradition produces an intertextual practice consisting of both familiarity and distance, and sometimes allows nuancing the image of an author, though that image is elaborated with stereotypes. At the same time, the texts illustrate a great fascination with alterity – which is no longer specifically identified with evil. Thus, because men and things are observed in all their complexity, the heroic ideal is nuanced, the relation between providence and the discovery of human destiny can reveal itself as ambiguous, and the representation of history includes a temporal depth that allows it to go beyond the closed timeframe of Carolingian themes.

The cartographic design of these maps includes a combination of map symbols and text labels. Automatically reading text labels from map images could greatly speed up the map interpretation and helps generate rich metadata describing the map content. Many text detection algorithms have been proposed to locate text regions in map images automatically, but most of the algorithms are trained on out-of-domain datasets (e.g., scenic images). Training data determines the quality of machine learning models, and manually annotating text regions in map images is labor-extensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, existing geographic data sources, such as Open-StreetMap (OSM), contain machine-readable map layers, which allow us to separate out the text layer and obtain text label annotations easily. However, the cartographic styles between OSM map tiles and historical maps are significantly different. This paper proposes a method to automatically generate an unlimited amount of annotated historical map images for training text detection models. We use a style transfer model to convert contemporary map images into historical style and place text labels upon them. We show that the state-of-the-art text detection models (e.g., PSENet) can benefit from the synthetic historical maps and achieve significant improvement for historical map text detection.",Subscription access with copy at arxiv.org,"Li, Zekun, Guan, Runyu, Yu, Qianmu, Chiang, Yao-Yi, Knoblock, Craig","Journal, Other",GEOAI '21: Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on AI for Geographic Knowledge Discovery,http://https://doi.org/10.1145/3486635.3491070,ACM Digital Library DOI,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) GEOAI-SIGSPATIAL,https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06104,Open access available through arxiv.org,Synthetic Map Generation to Provide Unlimited Training Data for Historical Map Text Detection,2021

21161,FEL-267473-20,"Recent discussions of animal communication and the evolution of language have advocated adopting a ‘ pragmatics-first ' approach, according to which ""a more productive framework"" for primate communication research should be ""pragmatics, the field of linguistics that examines the role of context in shaping the meaning of linguistic utterances"" (Wheeler &amp; Fischer 2012: 203). After distinguishing two different conceptions of pragmatics that advocates of the pragmatics-first approach have implicitly relied on (one Carnapian , the other Gricean ), I argue that neither conception adequately serves the purposes of pragmatics-first approaches to the origins of human linguistic communication. My main aim in this paper is to motivate – and begin to articulate – an intermediary conception whose scope is narrower than Carnapian pragmatics but broader than Gricean pragmatics. To do so, I first spell out what I take to be the key insight offered by proponents of the Gricean approach concerning the emergence of linguistic communication, namely, its being communication ‘from a psychological point of view' (Tomasello, 2008). I then develop this insight using key elements from the anti-Gricean ‘biosemantic' account of linguistic communication due to Ruth Millikan (1984, 1995, 2006, 2017, and elsewhere). I argue that the intermediary pragmatics-first approach that I propose, which draws on both Gricean and Millikanian resources, would be better equipped to serve the purposes of those who search for potential precursors of human linguistic communication in animal communication.",,Dorit Bar-On,Journal,,,,Biology and Philosophy,,,"“How to Do Things with Nonwords: Pragmatics, Biosemantics, and Origins of Language in Animal Communication” [",2021

Seyfarth &amp; Cheney (2017), for example, propose that ""animal communication constitutes a rich pragmatic system"" and that ""the ubiquity of pragmatics, … suggest[s] that, as language evolved, semantics and syntax were built upon a foundation of sophisticated pragmatic inference"". I begin by distinguishing two different notions of pragmatics advocates of the ‘pragmatics-first' approach have implicitly relied on (cf. Bar-On and Moore, 2018). On the first, Carnapian notion, pragmatic phenomena are those that involve context-dependent determination of the content or significance of an utterance or signal. On the second, Gricean notion, pragmatic phenomena involve reliance on speakers' communicative intentions and their decipherment by their hearers. I use the distinction, first, to evaluate a recent formal linguistic analysis of monkey calls, due to Schlenker et al. (e.g. 2014, 2016a,b), which explains the derivation of call meanings through a form of pragmatic enrichment. And, second, I use the distinction to motivate the need for an ‘intermediary pragmatics' that, I argue, applies only to a subset of animal communicative behaviors, and would allow us to reconceive the significance of animal communication for our understanding of the evolution of language.",,Dorit Bar-On,,,,,under review,,,“‘Pragmatics-First’ Approaches to Animal Communication and the Evolution of Language”,2021
21164,FEL-267473-20,"Ordinarily, if someone produces a nonreflective, ‘unstudied' self-attribution of a present state of mind – an avowal – we do not presume that there must be some kind of evidence, observation, or other ‘cognitive work' that the person could cite as the epistemic basis for her avowal. We take the self-beliefs proclaimed in avowals to be entirely spontaneous and base-less (as I shall put it). Correlatively, it seems out of place to expect the person to have reasons for the belief that she is in the relevant state, much less to expect her to know how she knows the self-attribution to be true. I will refer to this as the no-‘how' character of so-called basic self-knowledge. And yet we tend to regard a person's avowals as both distinctively secure and likelier to manifest knowledge than other contingent attributions (including attributions of mental states to/by others and even nonevidential self-attributions of bodily states). Basic self-knowledge thus has a first-person privileged character.  Taken at face value, this combination of substantiveness, no-‘how', and first-person privilege is puzzling: how can substantive knowledge of contingent matters of facts be at once epistemically base-less and substantive? And what makes such knowledge distinctively first-personal? It seems that we must either give up on base-lessness or accept that basic mental self-beliefs cannot amount to substantive (let alone privileged) factual knowledge concerning one's present states of mind. I am here interested in views that avoid this dilemma by denying an epistemological presupposition on which it rests. After rejecting a well-known reliabilist introspectionist approach to reconciling base-lessness with substantiveness, I turn to an increasingly popular constitutivist approach. I argue that leading constitutivist views fail properly to accommodate a certain doxastic (as opposed to justificatory) aspect of base-less self-knowledge, for reasons I explain.

This essay describes concomitant developments in the empire's Persianate political language, particularly with regard to ideas of sovereignty, statehood, and dominion. It argues that by the mid-eighteenth century, the Mughal ""empire of Hindustan"" was increasingly framed as a territorialised governing institution comprising emerging provincial sovereignties rooted in local ruling households. This conceptual dispensation, however, remained ill-defined until the 1760s, when a treaty regime dominated by the Company built upon this language to concretise the empire as a confederacy of independent, sub-imperial states.

10676,FB-55526-11,"In this article, I engage two examples of the Mahri language tribal ode in a thematic reading. &#x0D; A South Semitic language, Mahri is one of the few surviving remnants of the pre-Arabic linguistic substrate &#x0D; of Yemen and Oman. I argue that the rite-of-passage paradigm shared by Mahri and Arabic poetics points to a &#x0D; common origin at the convergence of language and culture in the Semitic pre-history of the Arabian Peninsula. &#x0D; At their point of convergence lies a conception of human society that is structured around the conflicting &#x0D; obligations of feuding and feud-mediation. Accordingly, a paradigmatic reading of ‘Arabian' poetics depicts &#x0D; a proto-historic social organization that can be described through the anthropological segmentary-lineage model. &#x0D; The interpolation of a literary-thematic reading of Arabian tribal poetry within a non-coercive, segmentary &#x0D; social framework suggests that the rite-of-passage paradigm is a rhetorical strategy by which tribal poets &#x0D; urge social consensus.

It is also a multilingual tradition. In terms of its topics, motifs and structural template, oral poetry in the Mahri language of Yemen and Oman appears to be closely related to naba?i poetry. This article examines various points of intersection between Mahri oral poetry and the regional idioms of Arabic-language naba?i poetry, as well as where they diverge from one another. Using the strictly oral poetic traditions of the Mahra as a baseline, the varying impact of written Arabic can be gauged against the vernacular traditions of the Arabian Peninsula as a whole.

Testimony provided by enlisted self-professed experts formed the intellectual architecture to the legal argument as it advanced to the Supreme Court. When considered separately from the trials, and distinctly as a question of the production of knowledge, the role of expert testimony provides crucial insight into the function of the university in antebellum anti-slavery thought and action, the marginalization of the lived African slave experience, and the emergence of Atlantic studies in the contemporary present.

This phenomenon arises out of the writer's distinctive method of close translation, and the deliberate strategies of lexical and stylistic control that he exercised. In this article I focus upon selected examples, including the vocabulary of death and dying, as a case study of how understanding of the dialect vocabulary of the OEB and its putative Mercian archetype can be extended. By comparing sets of synonyms – including dialect words like leoran ‘to go, depart, die' – with the Latin terms that they translate, I seek to demonstrate that the lexical systems identifiable within the text have important implications for reconstructing the hypothetical archetype, and also for understanding the varied ways in which West Saxon scribes undertook modifications of the text.",subscription only,Greg Waite,Journal,Medium Ævum 83.1,,,Medium Ævum 83.1,,,"‘Translation Style, Lexical Systems, Dialect Vocabulary, and the Manuscript Transmission of the Old English Bede.’",2014

The diplomatic transcription is followed by a description of the manuscript and commentary.  As the self-comment refers to the earlier, non-extant version of the poem (1893), an attempt is first made to establish possible thematic connections with other texts belonging to the poet's early period.  Specifically, the ethical issue of the exoneration of ""wicked"" (kakoi) or ""blameworthy"" people for reasons concerning ""responsibility"" and ""cause"" is traced to other self-comments (on the poems ""The Windows"" and ""Chè fece.... il gran rifiuto"") and personal notes of the poet.  A discussion follows on the possible relationship with the use of the word ""kakos"" in the Ajax, first in Athena's words in the prologue and then in Ajax's suicide speech.  Particular attention is given to the matter of the tragic hero's social isolation and his attitude toward his ""wicked"" enemies, a theme that resonates in ""Aimilianos Monai, Alexandrian, A.D. 628-655"", the only known poem by Cavafy in which the expression ""wicked people"" occurs.",open access,Diana Haas,Journal,Logeion.

The text is also discussed with regard to the unique testimony it contains concerning a relatively little known facet of the poet's publishing strategy (first documented by G.P. Savidis in The Cavafian Editions, 1966), namely the ""trial"" distribution of gelatin hectograph (""velocograph"") copies of his poems. The discussion serves in this way to shed light on certain obscure areas in Cavafy's idiosyncratic and complex procedure of poetic revision. Special consideration is given to the fact that the poet returns to the examination of the poem in 1906, a year characterized by intense self-criticism and doubt with regard to sections of his earlier production -- an attitude which, significantly, coincides with his decision to safeguard his independence as an artist by avoiding the commercialization of his work.",subscription only,Diana Haas,Journal,Kondyloforos.

10797,FB-56162-12,"Islamist rhetoric about the humiliation of Islam and American rhetoric about national humiliation have been energized by disparate events in recent years, from the photographs of American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia to the invasion of Iraq, the ""Innocence of Muslims"" video to the attacks on 9/11.&#x0D; At the same time, there's been an explosion of scholarship on humiliation as a driver of international conflict and political violence in general, and in relation to the bodies and minds of Muslims in particular. The link between humiliation and Muslims is thus a co-production between Islamists who continually invoke it and scholars from various disciplines and regions who regularly posit it. Yet there's been very little analysis of humiliation in Islamist discourse; minimal effort to anatomize the ways in which this experience of humiliation is constructed to necessitate particular kinds of retaliatory action; and no attempt to theorize more broadly about patterns and discontinuities in how different rhetorics construct humiliation. This article takes up the following questions: What is the substantive content of humiliation in such rhetoric and analysis? Do these different rhetorics of humiliation articulate the same understanding of it, as an act and an experience? What does close analysis of Islamist discourse on humiliation in comparative perspective reveal about the political stakes and affective resonances articulated and energized by it in this particular moment in history? Finally, what do the answers to these questions say about the reach and limits of the dominant account of humiliation as the violated dignity or injured self-respect of a generic individual?",Subscription only,Roxanne L.

These terms are at once very vague and miss the ways in which the videos are an instance of ""performative violence"" as well as horrific, physical violence. That is, they serve to perform the emasculation of these two men--and by extension of the nation they are made to represent--while symbolically transforming the ISIS militant who deliberately and publicly humiliates them, along with the so-called ""Islamic State"" he represents, as unstoppable, fearless, implacable and masculine.",Open access,Roxanne L.

This article examines Silvestrov's Symphony no. 5 (1980– 82), and the theory, practice, and reception of his evolving ‘‘post'' style. The symphony represents a unique congruence of modernism and postmodernism, nostalgia and continuity, expressed at the end of the Soviet Union, the end of the twentieth century, and what many believed to be the end of history. Completed near the conclusion of the Brezhnev period of stagnation, the symphony was intended to assuage the public's acute dissatisfaction with life in the USSR. Yet when it was first heard in the mid-1980s, it offered a comforting familiarity amid the bewildering acceleration of perestroika. Examining Silvestrov's ‘‘post'' style requires considering the sociocultural impact of his sense of ending by treating his eschatology as a useful fiction that illuminates the conflicting sensations of stasis and acceleration during the last decades of the USSR.

Attention to Thoreau's striving for ""awakening"" and ""alertness"" has veiled his running rhetoric of dormancy: scenes and tropes of sleeping, nodding off, sleepwalking, snoring, dreaming, napping, exhaustion, and catalepsy recur throughout the text, while factory bells, the shrieks of trains, cries of newsboys, and addiction to caffeine all perturb his slumber or that of his neighbors. The first three sections of this essay situate Thoreau's portrayal of a disrupted sleep-world in relation to the incursions of nineteenth-century patterns of labor and consumption, the spread of psychoactive substances and phenomena, and the rise of neurological science and psychiatry; a fourth considers his efforts to conceive alternative valuations of the sleep-waking continuum as a spiritual and bodily mandate. Using the lens of disability studies to link Thoreau's own private sleep disturbances to his broader critique of modernity, I argue that a reading of Walden can help uncover the origins of how sleep has become a problem in our contemporary world.",Subscription only; available on JSTOR and Project Mus,Benjamin Reiss,Journal,American Literature,http://americanliterature.dukejournals.org/content/85/1/5.abstract,,,,,"Sleeping at Walden Pond: Thoreau, Abnormal Temporality, and the Modern Body",2013

Since his paintings and collages are so little-known, one objective of this essay is simply to trace César Moro's extensive engagement with Surrealism in the visual arts, from his early participation in Breton's surrealist group in Paris, to the exhibition he co-organized in Peru in 1935, and finally to the ""International Surrealist Exhibition"" in Mexico City in 1940. By examining closely Moro's surrealist collages, drawings, and activities as an organizer on a transnational scale, I reveal the depth of his involvement with and impact on the surrealist movement. Beyond elaborating Moro's surrealist activities, however, I argue that Moro did not conceive of surrealism as a foreign import, rather he believed it to be the ideal visual and literary language with which to counter the entrenched nationalism of artistic production in the Americas. Moreover, he felt that by harnessing the power of myths and the sense of the uncanny already present in Latin American life, Latin American artists and writers could take the lead in implementing a new era of worldwide surrealism.

This process helps explain how over the 1930s a remarkably heterogeneous group of thinkers came to be included under the same label.

Despite the paucity of references to the Danish philosopher in Heidegger's Being and Time, these thinkers figured Heidegger as a ""secular Kierkegaard."" Both groups read Being and Time as an ontological analysis of the human subject, but the dialectical theologians located the secularizing drive in Heidegger's ontology, while the neo-scholastics identified it in the restriction of that ontology to the human subject. The contradictory accounts rendered secularization suspect. When Jean Wahl in 1937 accounted for the difficulty of secularizing Kierkegaard's thought, Wahl's argument drew attention to the fractious confessional context for the Heidegger reception.

Most scholars assume that French imperialists invented the term in order to justify their country's occupation of Mexico (1862-1867). In reality, it was first used in 1856 by elites in the region who were protesting U.S. diplomatic recognition of the filibuster regime that William Walker's band of U.S. expansionists had established in Nicaragua in 1855. ""Latin America"" was based on elites' embrace of a transatlantic ideology of whiteness associated with the European concept of a ""Latin race."" Nevertheless, the idea of Latin America cannot be reduced to what some scholars consider a form of coloniality. However much ""Latin America"" rested on racial foundations, it was also imbued with a democratic ethos constructed against U.S. and European expansionism. By showing how ""Latin America"" resulted from the transnational mobilization of an imperial concept for anti-imperial ends, the article underscores a hidden tension that marked the origins of the idea—a tension that in many ways lives on, as evident in the current debate in the United States over the meaning of Latino/a America.

Optical character recognition (OCR) can be used to produce digitized text, and previous work has demonstrated the utility of neural post-correction methods that improve the results of general- purpose OCR systems on recognition of less- well-resourced languages. However, these methods rely on manually curated post- correction data, which are relatively scarce compared to the non-annotated raw images that need to be digitized. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning method that makes it possible to utilize these raw images to improve performance, specifically through the use of self-training, a technique where a model is iteratively trained on its own outputs. In addition, to enforce consistency in the recognized vocabulary, we introduce a lexically aware decoding method that augments the neural post-correction model with a count-based language model constructed from the recognized texts, implemented using weighted finite-state automata (WFSA) for efficient and effective decoding. Results on four endangered languages demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, with relative error reductions of 15%–29%, where we find the combination of self-training and lexically aware decoding essential for achieving consistent improvements.",open access,"Shruti Rijhwani, Daisy Rosenblum, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Graham Neubig",Journal,Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl a 00427/108475/Lexically-Aware-Semi-Supervised-Learning-for-OCR,,Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2021,,,Lexically Aware Semi-Supervised Learning for OCR Post-Correction,2021

The article examines the varied uses of petitioning as a technology of colonial state-formation that worked to establish the East India Company's headquarters in Calcutta as the political capital of Bengal and the Company as a sovereign source of authority and justice. It also shows how petitioning became a site of anxiety for both colonial rulers and Indian subjects, as British officials struggled to respond to a mass of Indian ‘complaints' and to satisfy the expectations and norms of justice expressed by petitioners.

Modeling for students a way to identify these competing frameworks, and then intervene in deliberations to achieve just ends, is the focus of our assignment sequence. We examine civic deliberations over removing racist public symbols in this assignment for first-year students enrolled in linked rhetoric and philosophy courses. We read broadly in theories of public memory and civic identity, examine in depth one community's deliberation, and reflect on public symbols in our home communities. The final joint assignment asks students to identify the principles that should guide deliberations about contested public symbols. We found that the assemblage of ideas that the students select from these pre-drafting activities shapes what they think is possible in the work of social justice; in other words, their own standpoint enables and limits what they see in the assemblage of ideas, sometimes limiting the arc of social justice insights and solutions, and sometimes unleashing it. For this reason, reflective writing is a necessary entwined process, one that can develop better awareness of how students' epistemic norms shape their ability to imagine social justice ends.

21581,HAA-261258-18,"To a first-order approximation we can place most worship services on a continuum between clarity and mystery, depending on the setting and content of the service. This liturgical space can be thought of as a combination of the physical acoustics of the worship space and the qualities of the sound created during the worship service. A very clear acoustic channel emphasizes semantic content, especially speech intelligibility. An immersive, reverberant acoustic emphasizes mystery and music. One of the chief challenges in acoustical design is the fact that both clarity and immersion are subjectively preferred by audiences, yet these two goals are almost mutually exclusive of one another. The movement along this continuum in liturgical space can also be seen in the religious contexts for many of the worship spaces constructed in the West in the last two millennia. In the case of religious ceremony, a free field acoustic environment provides more clarity and precision in the spoken word received from God and given to the congregation. Yet a diffuse field environment provides an embodied, otherworldly sense of the supernatural: the mystery of the faith received which cannot merely be put into words. This tension is perceptible in many of the religious controversies in the West during this time period. This article examines the history of the spaces used by early Western Catholic Christians as well as those of the traditions—Lutheran and Calvinist—that left the Catholic faith during the 16th century Reformation. By considering the stated goals of these traditions alongside the architectural and liturgical innovations they created, it can be seen that emergent liturgical spaces mirror the assumptions of their respective traditions regarding the proper balance between semantic and aesthetic communication during the worship service.",Open Access,Braxton Boren,Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.564542/full,,Frontiers,,,Word and Mystery: The Acoustics of Cultural Transmission During the Protestant Reformation,2021

Bagenal predicted that the church had a shorter reverberation time than previously in Bach's time as a result of the Lutheran alterations to the space in the 16th century. This study uses on-site measurements to calibrate a geometric acoustical model of the current church. The calibrated model is then altered to account for the state of the church in 1723 and 1539. Simulations predict that the empty church in 1723 had a T30 value nearly one second lower than today, while the empty church in 1539 was much more reverberant than today. However, when the fully occupied church is simulated across all time periods, the difference in T30 is much smaller, with values at 1 kHz ranging from 2.7s in 1539, 2.5s in the present day, and 2.3s in 1723.

It focuses on transactions—how Schomburg bought and then sold his library—and disavowals—what he refused to purchase. Those moments when either the financial or affective price of history was too high for Schomburg show that the project of Black archive-building turned on absence as well as acquisition. Schomburg simultaneously critiqued the market's devaluation of Black textuality, ambivalently depended on that devaluation to afford his collection, and embraced an economic understanding of Black history as a form of reparations.",,Laura E.

21627,RA-278171-21,"This paper discusses challenges of the relative neglect of African poetry in literary and popular culture studies by attending to not only the primary texts, but the reading cultures they foster. Taking a diachronic and comparative approach, three serial publication formats across the past seventy years are examined: the Francophone African magazine Bingo from the 1950s to the 70s, the multiple printings of Chinua Achebe's poetry from the 1970s to the early 2000s, and emerging digital platforms in the 21st century. In each case, the rhetorical strategy of parataxis, or the juxtaposition of various forms and genres, contributes to the literary value placed on the poetry and its circulation among diverse audiences. The paper reconsiders the popular as a category of analysis that challenges a truism of African expressive culture—ascribing orality to tradition and written texts to elite structures—by attending to lay reading publics and their energetic engagement with the academy.",,Tsitsi Jaji,Journal,Research in African Literatures,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/766111,Project Muse,Indiana University Press,,,Our Readers Write: Mediating Africa Poetry's Audiences,2020
21637,RA-278171-21,"Who was Arturo (Arthur) Alfonso Schomburg and why, as we approach the sesquicentennial of his birth, do his life and work still draw us in?1 In the 1980s, coeditor Rafia Zafar, then a graduate student, read for the first time Schomburg's canonical essay, ""The Negro Digs Up His Past,"" a text that has long served as a touchstone statement for scholars in Black studies. His often quoted imperative from that essay, that ""the American Negro must remake his past in order to make his future"" (231), has rallied generations of subsequent researchers and creators. For Zafar, Schomburg was a theorist of the African diasporic archive, an intellectual whose vision made possible her own academic career. Coming to Schomburg in the early 2000s and in the wake of the archival turn, coeditor Laura E. Helton, herself an archivist, saw him as part of a cadre of bibliophiles and librarians who laid the groundwork in the early twentieth century for nearly every [End Page 1] major repository in the United States devoted to Black collections.

21629,RA-278171-21,"In this essay, I analyze the rise of vengeful populism in relation to sex workers in late twentieth-century Philadelphia as part of the popular response to the transformation in the city's political economy. I juxtapose vengeful populism with the rage of Donnetta Hill, a Black sex worker tried and convicted for the murder of two men the state alleged were her clients. In order to appreciate the contours of rage as a fiery cascade of affect, emotion, and action in the hands of a Black woman who faced violence, economic depravation, and social ostracization, I draw on Black feminist thought, especially as located in Audre Lorde's writing, about the generative nature of Black women's and Black feminist rage. Rage, in the context of Black feminist analysis and in Hill's actions preceding and after her conviction—which I classify as a spitting rage—signifies a form of power connected to self-preservation and the fierce desire to maintain one's chosen bonds of family, kin, and community. Rage is thereafter a positive program of self-definition, resistance, and world making. I highlight the contours of Hill's rage as a generative, if confined and constrained, force over and against the novel enclosures related to the transformation in urban geography, political economy, and politics in the decade and a half between 1980 and 1995. Though Hill's politics remain largely illegible because of the bloody and vocal expression of her disquiet, I want to appreciate these as abolitionist resources, however constrained and impinged on by the violent context in which Hill attempted to survive and live in the wake of social and economic abandonment.",,J.

It uses insights from history, ethnography, and cultural geography to connect the dual histories of racial slavery and environmental degradation in the Tidewater region of Virginia and the Mississippi Delta. This essay argues that, during slavery, swamps, bayous, rivers, and wetlands were geographies in which a fleeting Black commons could be sustained hidden away from the violence of the plantation. These same ecologies are now under extreme duress from coastal subsidence, the petrochemical industry, and climate change.

Roane examines the ways that the quotidian practices of Black ecologies and the tradition of Black feminist ecological writing and praxis alongside the work of Indigenous sovereignties serve as the basis for an alternative future beyond ecological catastrophe in the context of Turtle Island and with implications beyond. In his responses to the important questions posed in this special issue, Roane centers the alternative worldmaking embedded in Black feminist praxis and related traditions, considering them as the seeds for a generative future beyond the current horizons of future extraction and disposability. Roane's contributions to thinking about this in the context of pedagogy and curriculum emerges from his own struggles to transform discussions about the environment through the framework offered by Black ecologies as a mode of thinking together the reality that gendered racial capitalism sequesters Black communities to zones of expendability and also that these same communities possess the cultural resources and political insights to create meaningful alternatives (Hosbey &amp; Roane, 2021; Roane &amp; Hosbey, 2019).",,"J.

Incorporating folkloric tales, lyrics from popular music, and 19th Century satiric writing in Kreyol, ""Echec et mat"" offers a microcosm of the intertextual techniques employed throughout the entire collection, Veillées noires. In particular, I analyze Damas's embedding of a satire written and published in Kreyol by Guadeloupean author Paul Baudot.  While this Kreyol satire—written by a white béké author from the mid-19th Century—is ambiguous politically, and must be determined by musical and folkloric references, Damas nevertheless signals the importance of earlier Caribbean writing in Kreyol. Such writing co-exists with other forms of cultural production and is part of the reservoir from which Damas draws to assemble his complex anti-colonial discourse.

21671,RA-50132-14,"Cristofano Bertelli's companion broadsheets, printed in Modena in the 1560s, represent a failed attempt to introduce a new iconographic theme to the Italian print market. Contrary to the vibrant success of transalpine prints representing the Steps of Life with animal analogies, Bertelli's initiative did not stimulate Italian visual culture to produce the multiple copies, imitations and derivations long enjoyed by this motif in areas north of the Alps. The only other, comparable images to appear in the peninsula in the course of the sixteenth century would seem to be Titian's allegorical triple portrait (Venice, 1550–1565), and a pair of large, anonymous woodcuts from the later Cinquecento, possibly made in Venice. The recalcitrance of Counter-Reformation Italy towards this imported topos (probably Parisian in origin, and plau-sibly due to the presence of Lorenzo Penni in the Bertelli workshop) is difficult to account for, especially when a retail vogue for a similar genre—the multi-vignette moralising broadsheet— was trending in local print markets. There is no direct explanation for the apparent indifference met by Bertelli's attempt at iconographic innovation. Nonetheless, a cluster of factors relative to print culture and animal lore North and South of the Alps provides indirect but ample evidence to account for the ‘flop' of Bertelli's broadsheets. Among these, the Christian visual tradition features prominently, contributing to viewer diffidence towards serial analogies between humans and animals. The market for illustrated books on animals is also considered, as it testifies to a transalpine divide with regard to moralised natural history and, in Italy, an inhospitable cultural climate for the Steps of Life motif.",Subscription only,Sara F.

It takes for its case study the development of the field of fertility science and medicine, which is an outgrowth of Dr. J. Marion Sims's notorious, nineteenth-century gynecological tradition of invasive and injurious surgeries targeting the female body. More specifically, this essay offers a critical-comparative analysis of Sims's mid-to-late-nineteenth-century medical publications and Dr. Sophia Kleegman's mid-twentieth-century medical publications to highlight the differing pedagogies of sight at work therein. The analysis reveals that—in contrast to the objectivist, myopic, and exclusively female-focused visual pedagogy that Sims articulated—Kleegman's pedagogy provided disciplinary readers with a distinct, ""conservative surgery"" hermeneutic for scientific study and treatment that illuminated new diagnostic heuristics related to the proximity of pain, the scale of efficiency, and the boundaries of corporality and expertise. In this way, Kleegman's articles instantiated an alternative disciplinary optics that balanced past ways of seeing with emergent, ethically calibrated modes of clinical judgement. Ultimately, this technical intervention into medical vision facilitated the realization of increasingly humane and effective practices across reproductive medicine and fertility science beginning in the mid-to-late-twentieth century.",Subscription only,Robin E.

The Morgan (then known as the Pierpont Morgan Library) purchased the manuscript in 1962,  right before it acquired another Coptic Acts of the Apostles codex, the Codex Glazier.   While Hans-Martin Schenke edited this text, in the Middle Egyptian dialect of Coptic, in the 1980s, M.910 still awaits publication, which will soon be possible, thanks to collaboration between a scholar of early Christianity and Coptic (Paul Dilley), a computer scientist with a research focus on the digital recovery of ancient texts (Brent Seales and his team), and the head of conservation at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum (Maria Fredericks).   These specialists convened at the Morgan from December 11-18, 2017, to image the damaged manuscript with a Skyscan micro-CT scanner, donated for use in this project by Micro Photonics, the US distributor, and operated by Raj Manoharan.

21863,RZ-51768-14,"Though established in the 7th century BCE as an Ionian colony, Sinop (classical Sinope) served as a hub of maritime activity since at least the Early Bronze Age (3rd-2nd millennium BCE). Located in a protected natural harbor on the southern Black Sea coast, Sinop has throughout its history been better integrated into spheres of interaction with the larger Black Sea world rather than the Anatolian interior. Recent excavations at the Sinop Kale site uncovered a stylistically diverse assemblage of handmade ceramics which raises questions about interregional interaction around the Black Sea during the pre-Greek colonial period that may be addressed through ceramic sourcing methods. This paper presents a compositional analysis of handmade ceramics from Sinop bearing a rope-like pan-Black Sea decorative technique using portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) that answers specific questions of production and interaction at the site. In particular, it seeks to distinguish between non-local production and non-local technological styles produced locally, employing pXRF as a field technique. Results demonstrated that despite the visible diversity of the assemblage, handmade ceramics were primarily produced locally, as communities with distinct ceramic traditions moved through the Sinop Kale site.",subscription,"Nicole Rose, Alexander Bauer",Journal,Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.103239,Science Direct link to article,Ellsevier,,,"A field study of ceramics bearing pan-Black Sea decorative motifs from Sinop, Turkey, using pXRF",2021

While Rich is renowned as a poet of the Women's Liberation Movement (WLM), far less attention has been paid to her later political writing and the development of her political thought from radical feminism to Marxism. Drawing on published writing and archival research, this article traces the trajectory of Adrienne Rich's political thought after the WLM's decline, focusing on her articulation of a ""politics of location"" and her contributions to Marxism, which I argue are vastly underappreciated and essential to Rich's intellectual history and her political and poetic legacy in the twenty-first century.",Subscription based and available through Project Muse.

21888,PW-258989-18,"The arrival of large numbers of Yemeni manuscripts in European libraries towards the end of the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century was a sensation that was enthusiastically received by the scholarly world. One of the principal reasons for this enthusiastic reception was the upsurge of South Arabian studies in Europe since the first half of the nineteenth century, together with the hope that the new material would fill some of the gaps in the literary sources on the history and geography of southern Arabia, especially during the pre-Islamic period. The most significant such lacuna was the missing volumes 1 through 7 and 9 of al-Hamdani's Iklil. The two most important collections of Yemeni manuscripts that arrived in Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had been gathered by Eduard Glaser and Giuseppe Caprotti, respectively, and their collections were sold to Berlin, London, and Vienna (Glaser) and to Munich, Milan, and the Vatican (Caprotti). The collections included some new material on South Arabian history (including volumes 1, 2, and 6 of the Iklil), but they also opened up entirely new vistas and laid the foundation for the new discipline of Zaydi studies. Unlike South Arabian studies, the study of Zaydism had a slow start, with initially only a few scholars being interested in this entirely new field. Moreover, the scholarly exploration of the respective subcollections depended on the availability of catalogues. The early history of the Caprotti collection is intimately linked to Eugenio Griffini. Caprotti had dispatched nearly his entire manuscript collection of some 1,600 codices to Griffini, who kept it in his apartment in Milan until 1909, when the collection was donated to the Ambrosiana Library. Griffini was also the first and, for a long time, the only scholar to study the collection and prepare studies as well as catalogues of it...",,"Valentina Sagaria Rossi, Sabine Schmidtke",Journal,Shii Studies Review,,,Brill,,,"The Beginnings of Yemeni and Zaydi Studies in Europe: The Eugenio Griffini Archive, Milan",2022

A historical perspective illuminates the complex categories used to classify deaths from influenza-associated diseases; substantial changes in weekly, monthly, and yearly death totals; and thoughtful efforts by health officials to measure the epidemic as it happened. The 1114 influenza deaths reported by the Connecticut State Board of Health in the 3 years after the January 1890 outbreak must be supplemented by the notable increases in the number of deaths from respiratory diseases, which elevates the likely toll to more than 7000 deaths during the epidemic. Whereas historians of public health have primarily examined efforts to control communicable diseases, this case study of mortality statistics reported by town officials and analyzed by the Connecticut State Board of Health demonstrates how officers of the local boards of health also responded to unexpected outbreaks of a familiar disease such as influenza.

For years, Smith has been targeted by originalists who contend that, among other things, Smith is incompatible with a Madisonian understanding of religious freedom.

It attempts to do so not by employing the typical tools of originalist legal scholarship, but rather by setting forth Madison's political science of religious liberty. The article argues the logic of Federalist 10 is incompatible with exemptions from generally applicable laws and, therefore, that a Madisonian construction of the Free Exercise Clause would not support a constitutional right to religious exemptions.

This parochial label and the pathos of these well-known images have occluded our contemporary view of Diamond, who was regarded by his peers as one of the leaders of British photography. A recently identified album in the George Eastman House collection raises questions about our assumptions that Diamond approached photography purely in an instrumental or utilitarian way. In fact, the album suggests that at the same time as Diamond was immersed in the documentation of his patients, he was experi- menting with dramatically expressive portraits in ways that forecast the work of pictorialists such as Henry Peach Robinson and Julia Margaret Cameron.

But in certain inflectional suffixes [?] occurs instead of the expected [?] after palatalized consonants. In order to explain these apparent exceptions, I argue that vowel reduction after palatalized consonants is constrained by the morphology and that reduction to [?] is blocked in certain cases of the paradigm by the interaction of Relativized Paradigm Uniformity (PU) and Paradigm Contrast (PCON) constraints (Rebrus and Törkenczy 2005; Steriade 2000). The main finding is that there is a critical contrast between the singular and plural within a given case, NUMBER X CASE, and [?] is blocked when it would result in homophony with an /i/ [?] suffix in the relevant situation. When the morphological contrast is implemented by some other means, then regular vowel reduction to [?] takes place. The gen sg /-a/ suffix has special status due to type and token frequency of the [?] variant. An analysis in terms of paradigm uniformity and contrast provides a more coherent account of the direction of language change in CSR vowel reduction than do appeals to stressed vowel faithfulness, spelling pronunciation, grammatical analogy or paradigm uniformity alone.",Subscription,Christina Y.

In East Slavic, akan'e (neutralization of /o/ and /a/ after non-palatalized consonants) has spread or is spreading to dialects which maintain the mid and low vowel contrast (okan'e). Under the assumption that vowel neutralization is favored in durationally deprived syllables, it is expected that akan'e would first spread in weak positions, and in some transitional dialects this is exactly what happens: akan'e is found in non-immediately pretonic and posttonic syllables. But in other dialects, the patterns of akan'e spread are unexpected: it first appears in the immediately pretonic position and before stressed high vowels and often before stressed /a/ before it occurs elsewhere. I focus on these unexpected patterns and suggest that they may emerge as a consequence of perceptual salience through contact with neighboring strong akan'e dialects in Pskov and Novgorod oblasts of Russia and in Homel' and Minsk oblasts of Belarus.

11048,FT-60041-12,"For Kant, any authentic moral demands are wholly distinct from the demands of prudence. This has led critics to complain that Kantian moral demands are incompatible with our human nature as happiness-seekers. Kant's defenders have pointed out, correctly, that Kant can and does assert that it is permissible, at least in principle, to pursue our own happiness. But this response does not eliminate the worry that a life organized around the pursuit of virtue might turn out to be one from which we cannot expect any of this (permissible) happiness. To address this worry, Kant would need to establish that there is a kind of harmony between virtue and our own happiness that can give us confidence that aiming at morality does not require us to abandon our hope for happiness in this life. This paper aims to show that Kant—building on insights from Rousseau that Kant identifies with Cynicism—does offer an account of such a harmony between virtue and worldly happiness.",Subscription,David Forman,Journal,The Journal of the History of Philosophy,http://muse.jhu.edu/article/605955,,Johns Hopkins University Press,http://philpapers.org/archive/FORKMC.pdf,This is a link to a freely accessible (open access) penultimate draft.,Kant's Moderate Cynicism and the Harmony between Virtue and Worldly Happiness,2016

11061,HR-20172-01,"In an attempt to reduce the chance of torture as spectacle, many Latin American plays including those by Gambaro, Mario Benedetti, and Eduardo Pavlovsky pushed much of the torture offstage or redirected it in some way. Nevertheless, there are some performances in Latin America that have surfaced recently as the next generation of what may be called vicarious victims attempt to understand and take ownership of what happened during the dictatorships in Chile and Argentina. These artists present a challenge to the concept of distancing those acts of torture from the viewer. There are two events or cultural products, ""Tortured Body/Recuperated Body"" by Silvio De Gracia and Diana Torres's Pornoterrorismo performance of ""Perfo Luddite"" that are considerably more overt in their depiction of the torture that occurred during the Southern Cone dictatorships&#x0D; &#x0D; These two acts of spectacle and concomitant looking problematize the way in which traumatic historical events are witnessed. While they offer a means through which the traumas of the past can be viewed and perhaps ameliorated, they cannot completely distance themselves from the problems arising from the fetishization, commercialization, and position as mere spectacle. Furthermore, even if they allow viewers the possibility of a shift in their position from passive object to active subject, they run the risk of distorting the events to the point of unknowability. Though it is difficult to make any ethical judgment on ways of addressing traumatic pasts, in some cases there seems to be a disconnect between intention and execution caused perhaps by a distorted sense of empathy, economic concerns, or perhaps some combination of those issues.",Online publication.

This work built upon research begun in 2005 to closely examine the materiality of social and political life in a rural settlement of the Achaemenid Persian Empire (ca. 550-330 B.C.E.). Intensive investigations at Tsaghkahovit have revealed the remains of a community clearly enmeshed in select socio-political institutions of the empire, yet one also committed to reproducing and revising the contours of everyday life on the Armenian highlands in its own terms. The site thus invites consideration of the quotidian material and spatial practices of imperial subjects who both sustained, and rendered partial, the expansive reach of Achaemenid sovereignty in the Armenian satrapy.

By reconstructing trade and interest in birds of paradise in the Netherlands, this essay describes how these exotic wares were described and evaluated; how they were valued on and off the market; and how the awe that they inspired served political purposes.

I here experiment with an approach inspired by Benjamin, the intent of which is to expand our understanding of dialectics beyond the structural Marxism that dominates urban geography. I seek to temper macro-level analyses of political economies with a recognition of micro-level processes of both active matter and human consciousness that can shape, constrain, or undo. In fact, the evidence of urban archaeology demands such attention. Expanding dialectics requires a rapprochement among the followers of Marx, Sartre, and even Latour. I use archaeological evidence from New Orleans, and standard modes of organizing it (the property history, stratigraphy, taphonomy), to critique broader approaches to urbanism and materiality. Archaeology has much to contribute to understanding the city as an ongoing human-object formation full of contradictions, affect, and contingency.

Once we examine the Gulag through the lens of exploitation, then its willfully destructive capacity becomes apparent.  As Solzhenitsyn argued, the system of physical exploitation in the Stalinist camps reveals that the Gulag was designed for destruction. Stalin concealed the Gulag's destructive capacity, and kept death rates in the camps low by releasing millions of prisoners on the verge of death.  Within the barbed wire, prison laborers were constituted, managed, and discarded as human raw material.  To thoroughly wring prisoners of their productive capacity, the Gulag established categories of physical labor capability.  With each iteration of the physical labor categories and each revision of the List of Illnesses, the OGPU-NKVD-MVD and Gulag leadership tried to force a larger population of ailing prisoners into heavy physical labor.  The exploitation of inmates' labor only intensified over time, while officials concealed the Gulag's brutality through the routine release of invalid and chronically ill prisoners.

11293,FA-55436-10,"Ilyas Khuri's 1994 novel Majma? al-asrar builds a fictional world around a letter ""sent"" by the Nasar family that settled in Colombia, in García Márquez's Crónica de una muerte anunciada [Chronicle of a Death Foretold], to cousins who remained in Lebanon. The tale that Khuri spins around this phantom letter refracts the émigré experience through the perspective of one who stayed, using intertextuality and metanarrative to treat issues of migration and estrangement. Within Lebanese narrative fiction, given the country's high number of émigrés and transnationals, there is a concentration of texts written by authors that have not (yet) emigrated but that portray an émigré community and/or the community left behind that lives with the absence of its émigrés. Such texts can be understood as part of a broader category termed ""Migration Literature,"" a category defined by the themes of the texts rather than the geographic location or language of expression of the author. As Khuri's novel plays with shifts in perspective via intertextuality and a structure that highlights metanarrativity, it provides a shift in perspective on the émigré experience. I argue that through these shifts Khuri destabilizes one of the cornerstones of traditional representations of the mahjar experience, telling the émigré story from the other side and through intertextual relationships.

11320,HD-51907-14,"Coptic represents the last phase of the Egyptian language and is pivotal for a wide range of disciplines, such as linguistics, biblical studies, the history of Christianity, Egyptology, and ancient history. It was also essential for ""cracking the code"" of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Although digital humanities has been hailed as distinctly interdisciplinary, enabling new forms of knowledge by combining multiple forms of disciplinary investigation, technical obtacles exist for creating a resource useful to both linguists and historians, for example. The nature of the language (outside of the Indo-European family) also requires its own approach. This paper will present some of the challenges -- both digital and material -- in creating an online, open source platform with a database and tools for digital research in Coptic. It will also propose standards and methodologies to move forward through those challenges.

22071,FEL-262064-19,"In a clear and thoughtful reflection, the Notre Dame political scientist Vincent Phillip Muñoz recovers the Founders' wisdom regarding religious liberty. Promoting neither a ""wall of separation"" between religion and politics nor a direct embrace of religion in their political acts, the Founders saw religious liberty as a ""natural right,"" part of a larger fabric of rights and duties within a free political order. Political institutions had no right to coerce religious affirmation or to preempt the ""sacred and sovereign duties"" that free men and women owe to the Creator God. Religion should be neither ""established"" nor actively undermined by government acting outside its proper sphere. But contra the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court on these matters since the 1940s, government, state or federal, need not be neutral between religion and irreligion, and is free to favor religion to serve valid civic purposes. The Founders' vision suggests that one ought not to ""penalize religious citizens to advance an exaggerated freedom from religion"" or ""exempt religious individuals from the civic obligation of following duly enacted law."" A return to the nearly forgotten wisdom of the Founders on these matters might encourage moderation and compromise. It is certainly worth a try, Muñoz suggests, since the dominant approaches on the left and right have led to a civic impasse and have further polarized an already badly divided social order.

Looking at MS 41 as a whole book in relation to Cnut's (eventual) performance of Christian kingship (which was authored in part by Wulfstan and in part by Lyfing), the connections Cnut asserted with the house of Wessex (through his veneration of his ""brother"" Edmund Ironside and his promise to uphold the laws of Edgar), and, finally, in relation to increasing interest in Saints Cuthbert and Æthelthryth — who feature prominently in Bede's Ecclesiastical History and the OE version of it. While some of these ideas and connections are speculative, I hope to elucidate the continuing and changing significance of the OE Bede in the first quarter of the eleventh century, where it comes into dialogue with the writings of Wulfstan and Ælfric, and to demonstrate the value of integrating paleography and codicology into literary and historical analysis.",,Sharon M.

Demographer John Hajnal argued in 1965 that a distinctive northwestern European marriage pattern emerged post 1700 when a large population of unmarried men and women married in their early to late twenties, and formed their own household rather than join a multi-generational household. The corollary to this argument is that women in southern Europe married young and universally and thus rarely entered into domestic service. Medievalists have embraced and repeated this paradigm, shaping assumptions about the Mediterranean as less developed or ""less European"" than the north and ignoring the experience of women enslaved throughout the region.   Notaries and judicial officials in medieval Barcelona, Valencia, Mallorca, Marseille, Palermo, Venice, Famagusta, and Crete recognized singlewomen owning property, buying, selling and manumitting enslaved people, appointing procurators, committing crimes and making wills. We reintegrate the experiences of singlewomen, both enslaved and free, into the daily life of the medieval Mediterranean.

Original paddle designs carry rich historical and cultural information, but pottery paddles from ancient times have not survived. Archaeologists have studied design fragments stamped on sherds to reconstruct complete or nearly complete designs, which is extremely laborious and time-consuming. In Snowvision, we aim to develop computer vision methods to assist archaeologists to accomplish this goal more efficiently and effectively. For this purpose, we identify and study three computer vision tasks: (1) extracting curve structures stamped on pottery sherds; (2) matching sherds to known designs; (3) clustering sherds with unknown designs. Due to the noisy, highly fragmented, composite-curve patterns, each task poses unique challenges to existing methods. To solve them, we propose (1) a weakly-supervised CNN-based curve structure segmentation method that takes only curve skeleton labels to predict full curve masks; (2) a patch-based curve pattern matching method to address the problem of partial matching in terms of noisy binary images; (3) a curve pattern clustering method consisting of pairwise curve matching, graph partitioning and sherd stitching.

He politely questioned what reciprocation might be expected:  ""Considering my passion for horticulture, under how great obligations am I to you for your very agreeable present of such a variety of garden seeds as accompanied your Letter of the 17th &amp; are dignified by the circumstance of their coming from the King's garden?""  And he expressed hope that ""our republican soil"" would not harm the seeds generated in a ""monarchical climate.""  In citing the difference between American ""republican soil"" and the ""monarchical climate"" of Louis XVI's France from which the seeds came, Livingston was engaging in international political banter.  But was Livingston simply being witty?  Or were there meaningful differences between the two?  Would the French seeds mean something different in an American garden?  And conversely, how were American plants to contribute to the French landscape?  Put another way, could plants make place in the eighteenth century?  Or place make plants?  This paper addresses these questions through the analysis of late eighteenth-century Franco-American botanical exchange.  Through the exploration of plant lists, orders, and garden plans, the correspondence of gardeners and botanists on both sides of the Atlantic, the paper explores the role of European plants in American gardens and American plants in French gardens and addresses what both nations sought to secure through what American gardener Richard Cary called referred to as ""a reciprocal exchange of the productions of nature.""",,Elizabeth Hyde,Journal,Huntington Library Quarterly,http://https://muse.jhu.edu/article/851495,"Huntington Library Quarterly Volume 84, Number 3   Autumn 2021 ARTICLES   Stephen Bending, Jennifer Milam  OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS, some of the most compelling work on designed landscape on both sides of the Atlantic has focused on its symbolic power, on its ability to speak of nation and of national imaginings.1 Such histories of garden design, however, have also remained trapped within these imaginings of national landscapes and their geographies. This special issue explores the apparently ""national"" character of gardens in the context of their transatlantic connections during the long eighteenth century; here, we focus on shared cultures and outlooks, even as we recognize the powerful influence of local geographies and claims of national distinction.

22257,AC-258915-18,"In 1792, French botanist André Michaux entered into negotiations with Thomas Jefferson around the possibility of his leading an expedition across the American West on behalf of the American Philosophical Society.  The result was the extraordinary ""Subscription Agreement"" by which Michaux, who had been sent by Louis XVI to North America in 1785 to collect trees that might replenish French forests, agreed to undertake the mission to the Pacific. The document is special part of the history of the American Philosophical Society.  Examined in context of Michaux's original mission, that of the American Philosophical Society, and Franco-American botanical exchange, it illuminates larger debates and porous boundaries around nature, nation, and science in the late eighteenth century.   In drafting instructions to Michaux, Jefferson exhorted him not to take undo risk to his person, writing ""It is strongly recommended to you to expose yourself in no case to unnecessary dangers, . . . and to consider this not merely as your personal concern, but as the injunction of Science in general which expects it's enlargement from your enquiries, &amp; of the inhabitants of the US. in particular . . . ."" Science and the United States expected much of Michaux, as did the new French republic.  The expedition never took place.

22300,AKA-270141-20,"Engineers face complex and multidisciplinary problems in the modern work environment. To understand and solve these complex problems, engineers require systems thinking skills that allow them to consider the interconnected technical and contextual factors. Therefore, it is important to provide engineering students with opportunities to develop these skills during their education. A part of this process is developing assessment approaches that can help instructors measure students' systems thinking ability. A variety of approaches have been used in the literature to assess the development of systems thinking, including surveys, interviews, design projects, and scenario-based instruments. Scenario-based assessments can offer a more in-depth view of student learning than typical surveys while also being faster to analyze than open-ended data such as interviews. However, a range of scenario-based assessments that are available claim to assess similar skills, making it challenging to identify which fits the needs of a particular educational context. To help address this challenge, we compared two scenario-based assessments: the Village of Abeesee scenario [1] and the Energy Conversion Playground (ECP) design task [2], to understand concepts of systems thinking emphasized by each instrument and how students' scores on the assessments are related. The participants in this study were 19 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in an interdisciplinary humanities-based engineering course in Spring 2021. We administered both scenario-based assessments at the start and end of the semester to examine the change in students' scores over time. We then compared the assessment results from each instrument by examining average scores for each of the systems thinking dimensions and also individual total scores on each assessment. Lastly, we compared the experience of scoring the assessments from the perspective of the instructor or researcher using the assessment. Based on our find",,"Joshi, S.S., Davis, K.

22301,AKA-270141-20,"As the world becomes more connected and globalized, the problems that engineers are called upon to solve are increasingly complex and interdependent. Research on engineering work has suggested that professional engineers address open-ended, illstructured problems that are situated in specific contexts (Bornasal et al., 2018; Stevens et al., 2014). Unfortunately, engineering coursework has traditionally focused on abstract and closed-ended problem solving, offering few opportunities for students to develop these skills (Jonassen, 2014). Building on prior work, our project explored whether integrating engineering with the humanities could help students develop a better understanding of contextual influences in engineering work as operationalized through the lens of systems thinking. In this practice paper, we argue for the importance of integrating the humanities and engineering to understand the multiple and intersecting layers of context in an engineering project. We then describe the Humanities-Informed Engineering Projects course, which we developed to help students acquire this perspective. The course was piloted in Spring 2021 in response to the obstacles to international and community engineering experiences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we share preliminary assessment data on the development of systems thinking over the course. This pedagogical description and assessment project contributes to the understanding of the development of systems thinking and it also provides empirical evidence about the potential benefits of integrating the humanities and engineering in the classroom (Edmondson et al., 2020; Hynes &amp; Swenson, 2013; Pavlica et al., 2020).",,"Davis, K.

To understand Tocqueville's character, we must go beyond his published books and read his letters, even if they were private documents, not written in order to be published. Of course, we must be cautious not to infer from his correspondence ideas that Tocqueville never held, or to assume that his letters are of equal worth with his published works. Nor should we interpret them as if they are part of a larger theoretical framework that holds the key to his enigmatic persona. Many letters responded to particular circumstances or gave expression to his transitory moods. Nonetheless, they remain a diary sui generis of a lively mind in search for companionship and seeking to overcome the sense of solitude and isolation that he dreaded all his life. As such, Tocqueville's letters do not diminish his status as a major thinker; on the contrary, they strengthen it considerably and make him even more interesting (and more political) than previously thought. Most of them go beyond anecdotes and mere gossip and shed light on the genesis and evolution of his ideas.

Rousseau applied Dupin's mockery of the marriage contract to dismiss as fraudulent the politi- cal contract that previous natural law philosophers had imagined between subjects and sovereign. He then made mutually exclusive property the foundation of the republican social contract, just as Dupin had stipulated separately owned property as the condition of equality in marriage. Yet Rousseau rejected the feminist content of Dupin's arguments, despite incorporating her strategies. Paradoxically, while Dupin, a monarchist, construed marriage along the egalitarian lines of a friendship based on ‘la douceur du commerce', the republican Rousseau invested men with the douceur of the absolute sovereign, masking the contractual character of marriage by positing women's subordination to men as a matter of passionate attachment.",,Rebecca Wilkin,Journal,Early Modern French Studies,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20563035.2021.1924010,,,,,“‘Réformez vos contrats!’: From the marriage contract to the social contract in Louise Dupin and Jean-Jacques Rousseau”,2021

In the context of the 20th century, Dominican politicians&#x0D; and philologists converged, creating a concentrated network of schools&#x0D; with Spanish as the language of instruction, prohibiting the use of Haitian Creole&#x0D; (Kreyòl), renaming numerous places from French or Kreyòl to Spanish, and producing&#x0D; a corpus of texts which described and represented the Dominican linguistic&#x0D; landscape proper.

Yet, such policies have been less successful in advancing waste management programs that ensure a net environmental benefit. This article analyzes how EPR policies for single-use batteries in the European Union (EU), Canada, and the United States address the environmental costs and benefits of EOL management. Considering these EPR policies is instructive, because single-use batteries have high collection costs and are of relatively low economic value for waste processors. Without deliberate planning, the environmental burdens of collecting and recycling such batteries may exceed the benefits. This article considers how EPR policies for single-use batteries integrate performance requirements such as collection rates, recycling efficiencies, and best available techniques. It argues that for such policies to be effective, they need to be extended to address waste collection practices, the life cycle consequences of EOL management, and the quality of recovered materials. Such strategies are relevant to EPR policies for other products with marginal secondary value, including some textiles, plastics, and other types of electronic waste.",,"James M.

11398,FB-56565-12,"If recycling is a harbinger of a more sustainable society, then the lead-acid battery industry offers an apparent model of success. In the United States, more than 97 percent of lead- acid batteries have been recycled since the early 1990s. But this record of success is not new. The lead industry has been recovering lead from spent batteries on an industrial scale since the 1920s. This article takes a novel approach to explain the historical dynamics of the lead-acid battery industry: in- stead of narrating a linear commodity chain that begins with raw materials extracted from nature and ends with the dis- posal (or recycling) of a consumer product, this essay is orga- nized around a systems-based approach that tracks the stocks and flows of lead through the built environment. How has the structure of the lead-acid battery industry changed over time? Where have the threats to human and environmental health emerged in the system? How has the system and its risks been affected by occupational health, environmental, and trade policies? Considering the environmental history of lead-acid batteries reveals a complex and volatile industry shaped by dramatic swings in recycling rates historically. Ironically, the recycling rate dropped sharply as new occupa- tional health and environmental policies came into force in the 1980s. Recycling rates rose in the 1990s as the industry stabilized and consolidated. More recently, trade policies and tightening Environmental Protection Agency regulations have pushed lead-acid recycling activities abroad with conse- quences for human and environmental health that belie any straightforward claims about environmental sustainability.",,James M.

The laws of this God of the Symbolic are perverse in that they impose impossible requirements on all believers. By the mid-twentieth century, however, Catholicism was experiencing the revolutionary reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Dogmatic Law at this time gave way to a renewed emphasis on the community of love associated in early Christianity with the Holy Spirit. This God of the Real is inherently Trinitarian: God-Father-Thing, Spirit as community of believers, and Christ as the imaginary Real gap between them. The American gothic writer Flannery O'Connor in her short story ""A Temple of the Holy Ghost"" provides a meditation on this Real Trinity. In O'Connor's story a hermaphroditic circus freak becomes an emblem of the deadlock of sexual difference and a monstrous Christ-figure in the Žižekian sense.

This article combines both approaches, telling the story of a nineteenth-century Japanese maidservant both as a microhistory and as a global history. The maidservant, Tsuneno, is not an obvious protagonist for a global history. She never manufactured a product for export, conversed with a foreign person, wore imported cloth, or traveled beyond the shogun's realm. Yet her experience of urban migration, service work, and marriage resembled those of other women across Eurasia in the years between 1600 and 1900. Situating Tsuneno's mundane story in both local and global frames challenges the microhistorical approach by considering how questions of agency might be answered with reference to transnational and long-term trends as well as close attention to intimate contexts. It also shows how attention to overlooked historical actors might challenge the periodization and spatial imagination of global history. Maidservants' tales do not show us a world divided between ""Europe"" and ""Asia,"" or a sudden break that occurred with the industrial revolution, but continuities across space and time.",,Amy Stanley,Journal,"American Historical Review Vol. 121, No. 2 (April 2016:437-460)",http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/121/2.toc,,,,,"""Maidservants' Tales: Narrating Domestic and Global History, 1600-1900""",2016

11616,FT-54309-06,"From their outpost in the North Atlantic, the inhabitants of Cabo Verde's strategically located islands have looked beyond their shores ever since the uninhabited archipelago's rediscovery by European mariners in 1460.  Over the past five-and-a-half centuries, the Cabo Verdean diaspora has intersected with other diasporas across Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and South Asia.  This early itinerant history, while well studied in broad strokes, contains one theme just beginning to be explored by scholars: its Jewish connections.  In this paper, I focus on the conjoined Jewish-Cabo Verdean diaspora, exploring how this largely unknown yet historically significant dual diaspora is now being re-evaluated among contemporary Cabo Verdeans themselves (both on and off the islands).  &#x0D; &#x0D; Parallel to the efforts of many contemporary Portuguese and Brazilians, many Cabo Verdeans are now curious to chart and reclaim the somewhat submerged yet historically critical Jewish component of their island's identity.  They are seeking out both their Jewish family history and their peers with Jewish ancestry.  This ethnography of Cabo Verdeans with Jewish ancestry summarizes contemporary activities in which many Cabo Verdeans are now engaging in Lisbon, Praia, and New England, where they are reassessing the frequently overlooked Jewish underside to both their family histories and their national identity.

Although many critics have objected to Wilson's position, pointing out its misreadings of Darwinism, its male bias, its ethnocentrism, and its naturalization of an implicitly heteronormative reproductive sexuality, his claim retains its power, almost forty years later, as a description of how deeply the evolutionary imaginary has assumed the role of a cultural foundation narrative in late (western) modernity.[3] The once literary terms ""epic"" and ""myth"" have been colonized—at least in secular consciousness—by the more scientific ""evolution.""",Open Access,Vaclav Paris,Journal,Modernism/ Modernity,https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/beginning-again-modernist-epic,,JHU,,,Beginning Again with Modernist Epic,2016

Second, while the women who ran the houses had ambitions that they would take their place as equals in the world of social work, their defensive attitudes undermined by their efforts to build useful networks with Protestant and secular social workers, as well as Catholic nuns, who had far greater experience in the field.

The existence of such marks on pottery of the period had been largely overlooked. I provided a catalogue of some seventy pieces, from various parts of Greece, which had symbols that could be interpreted as potters' marks. My primary aim in that paper was to draw attention to the existence of such marks and to attempt to provide a classification of the main types of marks: 1) painted symbols on wheelmade pottery; 2) incised symbols on wheelmade and handmade pottery; 3) stamped impressions on coarseware pottery; 4) finger or thumb impressions; 5) isolated painted figures. Since 1994, additional Early Iron Age potters' marks have come to light, not least from Athens, the Corinthia (Corinth, Perachora, Isthmia), Ithake, Macedonia and Epirus. One aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the new examples—published and unpublished—as well as to isolate a group of potters' marks whose function is now assured: reference marks. The new corpus of non-alphabetic marks from Methone—not all of which are potters' marks—now fully published, adds a whole new dimension to any discussion of alphabetic and non-alphabetic marks on pottery in the later 8th and 7th centuries BC. The new Methone corpus may even contribute to a reassessment of the place where the adoption of Greek alphabet took place. &#x0D; &#x0D; The paper also reviews the evidence of the need for non-verbal and non-alphabetic symbols—semata—in early Greece, from Ajax's winning lot in Iliad 7.187-189, to Bellerophon's semata lygra in Iliad 6.168. In these early contexts, semata may have been simple symbols, pictorials tokens, or devices, denoting ""sign,"" ""mark, ""seal,"" ""signature,"" ""token,"" ""device,"" ""emblem.""

11891,FA-252070-17,"One of the many intellectual problems that faced Europeans following the discovery of the New World was how those lands had been populated before their European discovery, if all humans had descended from Adam and Eve. One hypothesis to account for the presence of Amerindian peoples was based on a passage in the pseudo-Aristotelian De mirabilibus auscultationibus, which spoke of Carthaginian navigators discovering a large island in the Atlantic. Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo in his Historia general de las Indias (1535) was believed to be the first to suggest that this passage showed that the New World had been discovered and populated in antiquity, and this theory was maintained by many later authors. In this article I examine anonymous annotations relating to the New World in a copy of the 1525 edition of Ptolemy's Geography now split between Princeton and a private collection in Brussels. The annotator proposes this same theory about eight years before Oviedo, and I suggest that the theory was transmitted from the annotator to Oviedo by way of Willibald Pirckheimer's Germaniae explicatio (1530, 1532). In fact, of the authors whose writings survive today, the annotator seems to have been the first not just to have proposed the Carthaginian origin for the native peoples of the New World, but the first to propose any theory to account for their presence.",,Chet Van Duzer,Journal,"Viator 47.3, pp. 365-385",http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/abs/10.1484/J.VIATOR.5.112363,,Belgium: Brepols Publishers,,,“Distant Sons of Adam: A Newly Discovered Early Voice on the Origin of the Peoples of the New World”,2016

The data shows that the permeation of formic acid vapor is at least two orders of magnitude slower than the permeation of water vapor. Measurements of the permeation of 30% acetic acid vapor through PET seemed to be due to the permeation of the water only, and the permeation of the acetic acid, if it occurred, occurred too slowly to be measured. The size of the diffusing molecule determines the permeation. Since the permeability decreases as the size of the diffusing vapor molecule increases, a plot of permeability versus vapor size allows the permeability of various other vapors through PET to be predicted. Colorimetry showed that porous PET allowed ambient vapors to diffuse into the encapsulate and the entire paper within the encapsulate was affected, not only the paper near the holes in the PET.",subscription only,"Patricia M.

Examined in the context of research on Muslim masculinities and the myth of Arab men's hypersexuality, I use this legend to argue that our approaches to ending sexual violence in archaeology and other fieldwork disciplines should avoid reifying Orientalist and racial stereotypes if these approaches are going to be effective in making our fields safer.",,Allison Mickel,Journal,,,,American Anthropologist,,,Legend of the Locked Doors: The Sexualization of Archaeological Site Workers in the Middle East.,2023

But her research is much more than memoirs. Mickel collected personal stories of these ""silent"" laborers and studied piles of historical documents to uncover how such archaeological enterprises worked, who the archaeological laborers were, how they gained their skills and knowledge, and what the consequences of foreign archaeological missions have been for local communities, cultural heritage protection, and the creation of knowledge. Her insights appeared in her 2021 book Why Those Who Shovel Are Silent: A History of Local Archaeological Knowledge and Labor, published by the University Press of Colorado.  Mickel documents how, season after season, large archaeological digs in the Middle East have historically used scores of locally hired archaeological laborers to excavate sites—to dig, haul, and dump excavated material. Her study reveals that many of these workers developed significant expertise in excavation methodology. But even though such projects would have been impossible without local archaeological laborers, these workers are rarely mentioned in archaeological publications and have generally been excluded from the documentation, analysis, and publication of archaeological research.  --Marek Dospel",,Allison Mickel,Magazine,,https://www.baslibrary.org/biblical-archaeology-review/48/1/20,,Biblical Archaeology Review,,,Silent Labor: Dig Workers in the Middle East,2022

Its visible body is smooth and simple, coiled into three highly polished circuits. The mouth is daubed with red paint, open to reveal fierce fangs and an elongated forked tongue; the body terminates in thirteen rounded rattles. In between, the only decoration is the varied coloration of the gleaming stone. On the underside, the carving is far more elaborate. The rattles and then the ventral scales of the serpent are lavishly detailed as they spiral upwards. At regular intervals, dots of red pigment have been added to these hidden coils, ornamenting the rattlesnake's belly. The three-dimensionality of this sculpture challenges display; photographs, casts, or ingeniously rigged mirrors can simultaneously make both the top and bottom of the sculpture visible for modern audiences, but it is likely that in Aztec times the serpent's coils were invisible, only hinted at by the rounded forms at the base of the sculpture.

We further argue that the order's decisions and actions were ahead of national developments in several important ways, and that, to some degree, these projects were a test case for future national abolitionist policies.

This paper offers a case in point through the investigation of number in Nadëb, a member of the small Naduhup family of the northwest Amazon, which reveals several typologically intriguing features. One of these is Nadëb's emphasis on verbal number as opposed to nominal number, even while any registering of event number appears to be secondary to that of participant number. Nadëb also relies heavily on suppletive or semi-suppletive stem pairs in encoding number distinctions in both nouns and verbs. Finally, Nadëb's resources for expressing number are quite different from those seen in its three sister languages, in which number is primarily a feature of the noun phrase, suggesting a significant reorganization of number-marking within the language family.

22714,FEL-273171-21,"Sexual violence in fieldwork contexts is an urgent and pervasive problem. In archaeology, much discussion is currently ongoing regarding how to change fieldwork policies and climate in order to end sexual violence in the field. In this context, I examine a legend that circulates among the Bedul Bedouin community in Petra about an American archaeologist who locked women students inside their bedroom at night in order to protect them from endangering themselves by going out at night. While I cannot corroborate the story with former students on the project, studying the contemporary life of this legend can teach us about the confrontations of race, gender, and sexuality that occur on archaeological sites in the Middle East and elsewhere. Examined in the context of research on Muslim masculinities and the myth of Arab men's hypersexuality, I use this legend to argue that our approaches to ending sexual violence in archaeology and other fieldwork disciplines should avoid reifying Orientalist and racial stereotypes if these approaches are going to be effective in making our fields safer.",,Allison Mickel,Journal,American Anthropologist,https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aman.13802,,Wiley,,,Legend of the locked doors: The sexualization of archaeological site workers in the Middle East,2022

22768,RA-235170-16,"In the early 1960s the aspiring patron and neophyte collector Abigail Weed Grey (1902–1983) organized a multiyear international exhibition program of modern arts, Communication through Art (1964–69), that brought modern arts and artists from South and West Asia to the United States and vice versa. Keenly aware of her position as an outsider to the art world and viewing herself as a non-elite patron, Grey was impelled by an ecumenical faith in the capacity of modern art to foster intercultural understanding. She strategically used the logistical aid of the United States Information Agency (USIA), a diplomatic body established in 1953 under President Dwight Eisenhower to propagate American culture internationally during the Cold War, to promote her progressive and spiritually inflected agenda of creating ""One World thru Art."" Through her travels and as the result of close partnerships with Asian artists and institutions, Grey amassed a collection in the 1960s and 1970s that introduced many Americans—both artists and art-viewing publics—to modern arts from beyond the North Atlantic. This article focuses on Grey's exchanges with and in India and the emergence of the collection against the transcultural context within which it was formed. On the one hand, she was navigating Indian discourses of modernism, twenty years on the heels of the country's independence, that were inflected by a strained faith in earlier revolutionary discourses. On the other hand, locatable within a broader US project of cultural diplomacy, the collections and patronage of Grey sit rather uncomfortably within a well-trodden history of Cold War–era imperialism. Neither representative of nor particularly concerned with US diplomatic interests, she nonetheless instrumentalized its Cold War–era diplomatic apparatus during a time of simultaneously invigorated and increasingly fractured diplomatic engagement with India.",open,Rashmi Viswanathan,Journal,Art Journal,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00043249.2021.1872298,publisher web site,Taylor &amp; Francis,,,"Art as Communication: Small Diplomacy and the Formation of the Grey Collection,”",2021

Faculty at the UCLA/Getty Program in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage are working to support the next generation of researchers and practitioners to become leaders in adapting conservation for the climate crisis and addressing social inequity. This paper presents the ?rst stage of an initiative to develop models for embedding sustainable practices into conservation education and producing scalable curricula for broad dissemination. In this ?rst phase, we performed literature reviews, canvassed the ?eld through surveys, conducted interviews and developed curricula for our laboratories and classrooms. Survey results indicate a high international interest in incorporating sustainability principles in cultural heritage education, but with a corollary challenge of being unable to substitute new concepts for those already taught. Literature reviews and interviews introduced the authors to existing pedagogical approaches for embedding sustainability within our courses. Sustainability concepts such as the Three Pillars of Sustainability, the United Nations Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Inform, Engage, Empower and Embed (I3E) systems provide guidance in our teaching. The next phase of the initiative will involve a close evaluation of pedagogical systems for integrating sustainability into the existing curriculum to ensure that emerging professionals in art conservation, built heritage, libraries, archives, archaeology and historic preservation will prioritize intersectional environmentalism.

Integrally, it also established an opportunity to study intensively collection material housed long-term in storage. An understudied group of armors, previously in the William Randolph Hearst collection, comprised a major facet of the work. Until recently, these steel defenses were stored on custom-made wooden mannequins from the early twentieth century. The case study on which this article focuses illuminates the authors' work undressing and dismembering one of these wood and metal bodies: a composite Maximilian-style armor (56.124.1-.10). Armor collection by patrons like Hearst, whose acquisitions decorated the halls of his vast New York townhome and Welsh castle of St. Donat's, was a manipulation of bodies analogous to Dr. Frankenstein's assembly of his own infamous monster. Collectors compensated for missing or incomplete elements with limbs poached from comparable period armors or, in some cases, with facsimiles likely crafted by Raymond Bartel, an armorer and Metropolitan Museum conservator turned Hearst employee. Disassembling and componentizing this armor into discrete body segments allowed the team to assess specific future conservation and safe-housing needs, isolate historical from modern pastiche, identify makers and/or regional origins, characterize craftsmanship details, and clarify the objects' contexts of use. The authors' work not only served the DIA's collections care mission, but also revealed valuable information that would have otherwise remained undiscovered.",,"Livingston Bailin, Megan Reddicks Pignataro, Chassica Kirchhoff",Journal,Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts 97 (2023),,,,,,Divesting/Dismembering: Storage Findings in the Disassembly of Armor,2023

22884,RQ-266249-19,"Questions of race have been central to an understanding of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935), yet the opera's portrayal of whiteness remains an aspect hidden in plain sight. While focusing on a Black community living under Jim Crow segregation, the work also features five white characters—a Detective and two police officers, a Coroner, and a lawyer—whose actions affect the lives of the people of Catfish Row in three often overlooked sections of the opera. Through close readings of the score, literary antecedents, and recorded as well as live performances, this article examines the relational role that whiteness plays in the compositional architecture and production history of Porgy and Bess. To show how the opera's complex social dynamics are embedded in its musical structure, I employ an interdisciplinary approach combining musicological analysis with critical race theory, which pinpoints racial formation as a key component of Gershwin's score. The article's central analysis of the score reveals nuanced portrayals of Jim Crow race relations, highlighted by both multilayered expressions of white supremacy and powerful moments of Black resistance. These nuances, however, depend on reading the opera in its complete state, yet the three Black/white exchanges are often heavily altered in performance. To further understand how staging these scenes can affect their meanings, I investigate several key productions from across the opera's history. Concluding with the Metropolitan Opera's 2019–20 production, I reflect that the depictions of police brutality, white supremacy, and Black resistance in Porgy and Bess are more painfully relevant today than ever before.",It appears to be open access.,Kai West,Journal,,https://online.ucpress.edu/jams/article/75/2/319/185498/Buckra-Whiteness-and-Porgy-and-Bess,,Journal of the American Musicological Society,,,Buckra: Whiteness and Porgy and Bess,2022

23014,FEL-281206-22,"Shortly before the premiere of  Cavalleria rusticana , Pietro Mascagni cut 246 measures from his opera. This substantial section of music has remained largely unknown and has never been examined. The reason lies in an ostensible lack of sources that might have shed light on these cuts. Recent access to the original prompter's score, the score once in the possession of the first conductor (Leopoldo Mugnone), autograph letters, unexplored reviews, and a rediscovered staging manual have made a thorough evaluation of the cuts possible. These cuts fall into three categories: (1) those tightening the pace, (2) those reducing the taxing part of the chorus, and (3) those accommodating transpositions requested at the last minute by the star singers Gemma Bellincioni (Santuzza) and Roberto Stagno (Turiddu). The article argues that the cuts had consequences beyond their originally intended function, affecting the staging, drama, and formal conception. In the ""Introduzione,"" for instance, they led to confusion about the way in which the scene should be staged; in the ""Sortita di Alfio,"" they eliminate music that functioned as the culmination of the aria's large-scale formal plan; and in the composite No. 5, they exaggerate beyond the composer's original conception the so-called dramaturgy of harsh junctures.

11965,FZ-231520-15,"While the importance of visual representation in the history of scientific discovery is&#x0D; widely acknowledged today by historians of science, little attention has been paid to&#x0D; how readers of newspapers also became viewers of science. This paper explores the&#x0D; historical role of British illustrated weekly newspapers in crafting popular visual&#x0D; depictions of science through their coverage of the annual meetings of the British&#x0D; Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) during the second half of the&#x0D; nineteenth century. Presenting selected images of annual BAAS gatherings that&#x0D; appeared in The Illustrated London News and the Graphic magazine from 1840 to&#x0D; 1880, it suggests that the choices that Victorian news artists made in representing&#x0D; popular scientific gatherings tended to reinforce an image of popular science as&#x0D; embedded in middle-class and affluent society and leisure culture?(in contrast to&#x0D; alternative contemporary images of science as dangerously isolated from ordinary life.&#x0D; The term ""popular science"" attained widespread use in Victorian society, though the&#x0D; exact notion of what popular science was, who practiced it, and what it was for, has&#x0D; changed over time.",,Jennifer Tucker,Journal,Historia Scientiarum: International Journal of the History of Science Society of Japan,,,,,,"""The Depiction of Popular Science in Victorian Illustrated News”",2016

12024,HK-230965-15,"Early modern printed books pose particular challenges for automatic transcription: uneven inking, irregular orthographies, radically multilingual texts. As a result, modern efforts to transcribe these documents tend to produce the textual gibberish commonly known as ""dirty OCR"" (Optical Character Recognition). This noisy output is most frequently seen as a barrier to access for scholars interested in the computational analysis or digital display of transcribed documents. This article, however, proposes that a closer analysis of dirty OCR can reveal both historical and cultural factors at play in the practice of automatic transcription. To make this argument, it focuses on tools developed for the automatic transcription of the Primeros Libros collection of sixteenth century Mexican printed books. By bringing together the history of the collection with that of the OCR tool, it illustrates how the colonial history of these documents is embedded in, and transformed by, the statistical models used for automatic transcription. It argues that automatic transcription, itself a mechanical and practical tool, also has an interpretive effect on transcribed texts that can have practical consequences for scholarly work.",Open Access,Hannah Alpert-Abrams,Journal,Digital Humanities Quarterly,http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000268/000268.html,Journal Website,,,,Machine Reading the Primeros Libros,2016

12099,HD-248410-16,"Authors often convey meaning by referring to or imitating prior works of literature, a process that creates complex networks of literary relationships (""intertextuality"") and contributes to cultural evolution. In this paper, we use techniques from stylometry and machine learning to address subjective literary critical questions about Latin literature, a corpus marked by an extraordinary concentration of intertextuality. Our work, which we term ""quantitative criticism,"" focuses on case studies involving two influential Roman authors, the playwright Seneca and the historian Livy. We find that four plays related to but distinct from Seneca's main writings are differentiated from the rest of the corpus by subtle but important stylistic features. We offer literary interpretations of the significance of these anomalies, providing quantitative data in support of hypotheses about the use of unusual formal features and the interplay between sound and meaning. The second part of the paper describes a machine-learning approach to the identification and analysis of citational material that Livy loosely appropriated from earlier sources. We extend our approach to map the stylistic topography of Latin prose, identifying the writings of Caesar and his near-contemporary Livy as an inflection point in the development of Latin prose style.

12115,RA-50040-06,"This article inquires into the work of modern minority discourse and politics that delineates the boundaries of the Turkish national subject as Turkish-Islamic. It argues that the Turkish minority concept, which is based on imaginaries that justify claims of national and religious sameness and difference, needs to be understood against the backdrop of its historical formation. In the late Ottoman Empire, the socio-political grounds of communal sameness/difference were radically transformed. In this process, ethno-religious millets turned into national millets, culminating in the re-conceptualization of the non-Muslim millets as religious minorities in the early Republic of Turkey. The article further shows how the restriction of minority rights to non-Muslims puts the Turkish concept of minority/azinlik at odds with international conventions on minority discourse. It creates ambivalences with regard to citizenship and nationhood status not only for them, but also for disadvantaged Muslim subgroups, such as the Alevis. Drawing in particular on the case of the Alevi community, I will demarcate the contested entry and exit points of nationhood and religion, in relation to which the minority label is organized in Turkey. Having to negotiate the pitfalls of Turkish identity discourses, Alevis employ the semantics of international human rights discourse in their quest for equal rights and recognition, while rejecting the minority label.",open access,Markus Dressler,Journal,,http://newdiversities.mmg.mpg.de/?page id=1644,"on-line journal access, New Diversities",,,,Historical Trajectories and Ambivalences of Turkish Minority Discourse,2015

The scandal escalated into a crisis in which the large armies of the governors of Anatolia and Rumeli (the Ottoman Balkans) verged on clashing because each wanted to lead the state's lucrative war against Rumeli bandit networks.

I draw on understandings of gossip as a social and cultural resource from linguistic anthropology to make sense of Ottoman political culture.

I show that gossip, rumor, and related forms of seemingly informal ""talk"" played a fundamental role in sovereign decision making.

We explore one Yörük-legacy (Tekeli tribe) compound to understand ‘settled' lifeways over three generations, and how study of these legacy traditions may be a valuable contribution to experimental archaeology. Our entry into this discussion is a study of food – its preparation, storage, and consumption – and its associated olfactory landscapes. While ethnography helps determine how aromas define active and contemporary spaces and spheres of intimacy, sediment geochemistry offers a method for investigating archaeologies of aroma.",subscription,"Luke, Christina, Roosevelt, C.H., Scott, C.",Journal,,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10761-016-0345-6,,Springer,,,"Yörük Legacies: Space, Scent, and Sediment Geochemistry",2017

Digitization, in a fully digital paradigm, refers to practices that leverage advances in onsite, image-based modeling and volumetric recording, integrated databases, and data sharing. Such practices were implemented in 2014 during the inaugural season of the Kaymakçi Archaeological Project (KAP) in western Turkey. The KAP recording system, developed from inception before excavation as a digital workflow, increases accuracy and efficiency as well as simplicity and consistency. The system also encourages both practical and conceptual advances in archaeological practice. These involve benefits associated with thinking volumetrically, rather than in two dimensions, and a connectivity that allows for group decision-making regardless of group location. Additionally, it is hoped that the system's use of almost entirely ""off-the-shelf"" solutions will encourage its adoption or at least its imitation by other projects.",Open Access,"Roosevelt, C.H., Cobb, P., Moss, E., Olson, B., Ünlüsoy, S.",Journal,Journal of Field Archaeology,,,Taylor and Francis,,,Excavation is destruction digitization: Advances in archaeological practice.,2015

C. Bradley. The brevity of this essay necessarily means that its argument is suggestive, rather than exhaustive, since it relies on a ludicrously thin biopsy of examples. The essay nevertheless proposes that assessments of Shakespearean acting in the twenty-first century remain beholden to ideas developed in the nineteenth.

In Book V, Spenser hones in on a feature of poetry that pervades The Faerie Queene and generally works to illuminate and expand the imaginative prospects of the poem: this is the art of comparison, which comprehends matters great and small in Spenser's book and in Elizabethan culture. It affects the practice of analogy, which extends across disciplines of knowledge (including mathematics, grammar, and law) to consider matters of proportion, correspondence, resemblance, and reasoning based on parallel cases; the humanist project of imitation based on classical as well as biblical models; and the epic simile, in which comparisons between one thing and another are drawn out in ways that make their prospects of success or failure seem to be co-extensive with the possibilities of poetic interpretation itself.

I wish to approach the issue from the perspective of the classics, with the aim of historicizing some functions of authorial returns in Shakespeare's day and in criticism since the rise of the New Historicism. Shakespeare's contemporaries thought of authors chiefly in terms of classical writers, and they regularly called on ""authorities"" such as Vergil, Horace, and Ovid, or Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus, to advance their own projects. Yet they did not forge the positivistic link between the classics and the idea of the author that shows up in modern criticism. They recalled classical texts through a variety of modes, not all of which produced the heightened sense of authorial presence, even aura, associated with the most privileged mode of classical transmission, namely, imitation or sustained allusion. The various rhetorical forms in which Renaissance writers recalled the classics in fact suggest multiple and incongruent models of authority, authorship, and agency; and this diversity of forms may productively complicate what it means to say that the author has returned to Shakespeare studies.",,Heather James,,Shakespeare Studies,,,Associated University Presses,,,"Shakespeare, the Classics, and the Forms of Authorship",2008

It concludes that teaching these worldviews and theories will help maintain the cultural sustainability of this and other Nepali performance traditions, by helping students make connections among the traditionally related aspects of performance: instrumental music, song, poetry, dance, and drama.

Taken nearly whole-cloth from the Tuscan Collectio Barberiniana, the canons of Reims 15 shed light on the transmission of legal material from northern Italy to northern France, and offer precious insight into how this material was assembled for use. Moreover, substantial elements of the florilegium were incorporated into the eleventh-century legal collection known as Sinemuriensis. Using the canonical material of Reims 15, this paper offers a new hypothesis concerning the various recensions of Sinemuriensis and their dating, and concludes with an edition of the canons from the Reims florilegium.",,John S.

23416,FT-62004-14,"The semi-arid interior of Brazil's northeast region, known as the sertão, has long been subject to droughts. These can devastate the agricultural and ranching economy and cause serious hardship for the area's inhabitants, particularly those who labor on farms and ranches belonging to the landowning elite. A prolonged drought in the late 1870s led the Brazilian government to begin soliciting advice from engineers about how to redress the periodic crisis. In 1909 the federal government established a permanent federal agency, the Inspectorate for Works to Combat Drought, to undertake reservoir construction throughout the sertão along with other measures that would alleviate future droughts. In subsequent decades the activities of the drought agency expanded to include constructing irrigation networks around reservoirs and establishing agricultural experiment stations to teach sertanejo farmers improved methods of farming in semi-arid conditions. Although powerful landowners lobbied for federal aid to construct reservoirs, which helped to sustain their own cattle herds through drought years, they were often opposed to initiatives like the establishment of irrigated smallholder colonies around reservoirs, which threatened to alter the social order in the sertão. Support for the federal drought agency's work waxed and waned during the 20th century under different presidential administrations. Often it would rise in response to a period of damaging drought, then diminish once the crisis abated.  Droughts have affected the sertão at irregular intervals since at least the colonial era. They vary in temporal duration and geographic expanse. Their impact on human populations depends on how the area of reduced rainfall overlaps with human settlement patterns and land use....",online by subscription,Eve E.

23417,FEL-281728-22,"In this essay I identify a type of linguistic phenomenon new to feminist philosophy of language: biased evaluative descriptions. Biased evaluative descriptions are descriptions whose well-intended positive surface meanings are inflected with implicitly biased content. Biased evaluative descriptions are characterized by three main features: (1) they have roots in implicit bias or benevolent sexism, (2) their application is counterfactually unstable across dominant and subordinate social groups, and (3) they encode stereotypes. After giving several different kinds of examples of biased evaluative descriptions, I distinguish them from similar linguistic concepts, including backhanded compliments, slurs, insults, epithets, pejoratives, and dog whistles. I suggest that the traditional framework of Gricean implicature cannot account for biased evaluative descriptions. I discuss some challenges to the distinctiveness and evaluability of biased evaluative descriptions, including intersectional social identities. I conclude by discussing their social significance and moral status. Identifying biased evaluative descriptions is important for a variety of social contexts, from the very general and broad (political speeches) to the very particular and small (bias in academic hiring).",Subscription only,Sara Bernstein,Journal,Journal of the American Philosophical Association,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association,Journal of the American Philosophical Association,Journal of the American Philosophical Association,,,Biased Evaluative Descriptions,2022

The article illustrates how this archive complicates notions of border and foreignness by emphasizing colonial exchanges and movements at the time of the Spanish Empire. More specifically, Memoria Presente shows how their legacy has effectively redefined European and American cultural geographies in multiple ways.  The project illustrates this re-definition by also analyzing post-imperial migratory flows from Italy to Latin America and postcolonial ones from Latin America to Italy, which reflect further mechanisms of transnational exchange ranging from language to literature, film, religion, music and food. The main goal of Memoria Presente has so far been that of creating a digital archive of interdisciplinary materials for the use of teachers and researchers. Besides describing the content of the archive in general terms, this article addresses the applicability of these materials for public events and scholarly collaborations, and their use in courses of Italian for Spanish speakers.

Vienna 1900 was a polyglot, multicultural city, a place where European Jewry had risen to unforeseen heights of economic prosperity and cultural influence; many Nazi ideologues, historians, and authors focused on the verjudet nature of late imperial Vienna. A variety of strategies were employed to distance the Nazi present from Vienna 1900; it was alternately suppressed and ignored, or deeply vilified. Yet the period was also inseparable from two figures celebrated in Nazi Vienna: mayor Karl Lueger and artist Gustav Klimt.  This article examines Nazi discourse on Vienna 1900, especially that originating from Viennese writers, ideologues, and political figures. Reflecting both scholarly and popular views, I examine academic texts, books for popular readers, films, and art exhibitions. After examining the perception and appropriation of Vienna 1900 between the years 1938 and 1945, I end by exploring its instrumentalization in a different context.

An assessment of Agamben's argument thus requires close attention to his signature philological moves, an exegesis of his exegeses.

I offer critiques both of his method of philosophical archaeology and of his anthropology, raising questions about the tension between domination and mutual use, about the limits power imposes on potentiality, and about the paradoxical privilege implied by indifference to freedom.

Using Air Jamaica and its flight attendants as a lens on tourism across the region, this article demonstrates how, at midcentury, the industry was a complicated and contradictory mix of optimistic visions of advancement and problematic projections of creolized citizenship, all embedded in an imagery of a consumable Caribbean island paradise. The article interrogates the critical role that Air Jamaica's flight attendants and other women played in selling a harmonious Jamaicanness and idealized island fantasy to global North travelers, particularly in contrast to the larger national project of democratic socialist reform under Michael Manley. Despite efforts to put the tourism industry back into Jamaican hands, the act of trading on a romanticized racial hybridity and gendered, exoticized servility is inextricable from the story of tourism development in Jamaica and the region and points to the many contradictions entrenched (and persistent) in the industry.",,Elizabeth Manley,Journal,Hispanic American Historical Review,https://doi.org/10.1215/00182168-9653504,,Duke University Press,,,Runway Hospitality: Air Jamaica’s “Rare Tropical Birds” and the Embodied Gender and Race Politics of Tourism (1966-1980),2022

23486,FA-252385-17,"Coral circulated through the everyday lives of antebellum women and men (free and enslaved) as beads, necklaces, bracelets, reef specimens, and other objects. And antebellum coral was almost always more than merely ornamental. Coral has captivated people, across many cultures and centuries, because of its unique physical nature that combines animal and plant, living and nonliving matter, and that grows continually and unpredictably from the interaction of many small and sometimes invisible forces. Coral's fluid, composite, indeterminate nature and growth set it apart from other natural materials, and it has historically raised new questions, prospects, and possibilities about the natural world as a whole. Yet the many prospects coral raised across centuries and cultures, I argue, share a central feature that enthralled antebellum Americans: coral provoked the recognition that there are limits to our capacity to know, describe, predict, classify, and rank nature, both human and nonhuman. ""Antebellum Coral"" assembles several written and visual reflections on coral beads and reveals how the cultural and natural history of these small everyday objects challenged the taxonomic thinking that increasingly structured antebellum life.

23489,FT-61483-14,"Amon Wilbee was the authorial pseudonym for four tracts critical of the Long Parliament that appeared between July 1647 and May 1648. Wilbee depicted leading MPs as corrupt, self-interested, and insensitive to the needs of the people. These tracts reveal much about the origins of the Levellers; but, because of their uncertain authorship, they have received little attention from civil war historians. This essay provides the first systematic examination of their authorship, publishing contexts, and relevance to scholarly interpretation of the Levellers. Extensive textual comparisons suggest that William Walwyn was probably the principal drafter of the Amon Wilbee tracts; Richard Overton and Edward Sexby are also identified as likely contributors.  Amon Wilbee's political posture evolved from anti-Presbyterianism in July 1647 to a broader disillusionment with leading Independents and the Long Parliament itself by November 1647. Wilbee's polemical trajectory is consistent with recent scholarly assertions that the Levellers did not fully emerge as a detached political faction until the autumn of 1647. The authorship and print history of these publications point to a convergence of civilian and army radicals in the emergence of the Levellers at that time. As political propaganda, the Wilbee tracts sought to influence and mobilize a radical Independent community of discourse in London, nearby counties, and the New Model Army from which the initial Leveller following was drawn. The essay also bears significantly on interpretations of the Leveller authors' attitudes towards monarchy and republicanism and helps explain why the Levellers attracted ordinary people.",Subscription only,Gary S.

In a first for the archaeological site of Mycenae, we utilized a contextual taphonomic approach and statistical analysis to study a faunal assemblage, focusing on a massive deposit recovered from a well feature located in Room ? of Petsas House. Petsas House was an industrial-residential complex at Mycenae used at least in part by ceramic artisans at the time of its destruction in the Late Helladic IIIA2 period. Intra-contextual analysis of the animal remains detected sub-assemblages with variable histories of animal use and deposition. The results revealed multiple disposal events and possible dog interments. Most of the refuse in the well likely originated from rubbish piles in the surrounding rooms and periphery that were cleaned after a destructive earthquake. Together, the faunal evidence yielded a more nuanced, possibly seasonal picture of animal access than previously available at this important political center.

Anderson  This article uses Robert Dahl's book, How Democratic is the American Constitution? to examine contemporary political events in the United States.  While the Constitution was intended to promote democracy in spirit, it is not democratic in three particulars:  the Senate, Supreme Court and Electoral College are barriers against the people's opinion.  Recent events show that each of these institutions has defied majority opinion and tilted policy toward the right, advantaging the wealthy.  When these institutions combine with the presence of an authoritarian leader, supported by a non-democratic party, the threat to American democracy is extreme.  The article then examines three additional issues that derive from the Senate, Court and College:  impeachment, the non-democratic electorate and rogues inside elected chambers.  These issues endanger democracy further.  Recent events show that Dahl was correct that these institutions are a danger to democracy.  They have exaggerated the threat of authoritarianism rather than protecting against tyranny, increasing the likelihood of democratic breakdown.  Dahl argues that we should reduce the influence of these institutions, making the political system more faithful to the spirit of the Constitution.  Conversations about several such changes are underway now.   Key words:  American Constitution, democratic breakdown, Senate, Supreme Court, Electoral College",open access,Leslie E.

First, the article presents an overview of the manuscript witnesses to the 'Middle Recension', illustrating the diverse texts collected together under the umbrella of this purportedly singular 'recension'. Then the article takes a close look at the two extant Coptic versions of the letters of Ignatius, which present unique selections and arrangements of the collection unaccounted for by the three-recension model. These versions also contain distinctive textual variants that evince interpretive engagement and further illustrate the model's heuristic limitations.

At a signal moment in England's international relations, this book brings not a new word to English readers: the included Hoby, Chappuys, and Castiglione versions were widely available in England (previous editions in English and Latin, and the bilingual French editions on which Wolfe probably based the concept of this work, are noted here). But Wolfe's mise-en-page establishes and encourages a newly internationalized English courtiership, and his choices of previous paratexts are also strategic and significant in the new moment. The edition does much more than multiply by three Hoby's appropriative impulses.

The old division that Littau discusses between the supposedly immaterial work and the supposedly incidental material text that conveys it has, I hope, been thoroughly collapsed among book historians following D. F. McKenzie (1999 McKenzie, D. F. 1999. Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts.

Matter does matter, and media are not mere tools: on this we agree. Scholars in both fields, TS and MS, understand that physical forms (including digital forms) not only make possible the uptake of meaning, but also shape and construct that meaning, and mean in themselves.

12373,RA-50043-06,"When Heneage Finch transcribed his wife's selected writings into a folio manuscript after James II's death in September 1701, he preserved two plays essential for understanding both Anne Finch's artistic development and her method of political intervention.1 The Triumphs of Love and Innocence (c. 1688-1690) and Aristomenes (c. 1690) participated in a mode, like songs and occasional verse, favored by writers in Finch's courtly milieu. The plays reflect her experimentation with various genres, as she composed first a tragicomedy in which the evil are banished and the good rewarded, and next, a tragedy about a charismatic but flawed ruler and his conflicted children. Both plays reveal Finch as an avid student of favorite dramatists, such as Shakespeare and Otway. The plays also show that like her peers at James II's court, Finch intended her plays to comment on contemporary political events through well-established literary devices and subtle allusions. For various reasons, Finch's plays have not been sufficiently examined, especially in their political dimensions. But attention to the political implications of Finch's plays, both in manuscript and print, support arguments that Finch intended her writings to encourage positive reaction to James's policies while he was king, and afterward, support for his restoration. In this essay, I argue the importance of Finch's manuscripts to informed consideration of her writings, and particularly that study of Finch's plays in their manuscript and, in one case, printed version supports interpretations of Finch's works as politically dynamic. Indeed, Finch's purposeful revisions of Aristomenes for print demonstrate her support for the Stuart cause during the critical year preceding Anne's death. I conclude that a standard critical edition of Finch's writings, providing access to Finch's revisions throughout her canon, is urgently needed to advance scholarship on her work, in its political and all other dimensions.",,Claudia Kairoff,Journal,Restoration,,,,,,Anne Finch as Playwright: The Purposes of Manuscript and Print in Her Pro-Stuart Plays,2014

The making of the inventory was more than a routine bureaucratic procedure; it provides a valuable entrée into high political intrigue, as those who were drawing up the inventory were also engaged in secret negotiations for the Treaty of Dover (1670). The assessment of the inventory itself, particularly the Queen's art collection, reveals a refined taste for old and ‘moderne' masters, as well as a sense of her purpose as the handmaiden of the Catholic faith for a Protestant country. The inventory's significance to the history of collecting and display goes well beyond her space at Colombes, shedding new light on her rooms at the post-Restoration Somerset House, treasures she maintained from the 1630s, and possible acquisitions of the 1640s and 1650s.

Though the author himself has written of ""panic"" and ""frenzy"" in earlier studies, he argues here that these terms have led to a distorted perspective which encourages attention to episodes of large-scale panic and overemphasizes torture and the devil. The distortion can be corrected by looking at places that avoided massive outbursts (the Palatinate, Rothenburg o.d. Tauber, Württemberg) and noting that even when there were many executions, trials could occur within the framework of processus ordinarius (Mecklenburg). Overall, most witch trials were routine, focusing on ordinary maleficium,which was far more widespread than we thought a generation ago; England, with trials of individuals more than chain-reaction trials, and with little interest in diabolical witchcraft, is more typical than we thought.",,H.

12391,RA-50043-06,"T HE ANTHOLOGY IS THE CANON ' S SHADOW. I mean this in two ways.&#x0D; First, anthologies of ""non-Shakespearean"" early modern drama published&#x0D; in the last hundred years share a recognizable profile, an arc of evolutionary history&#x0D; from The Spanish Tragedy to Edward II to The Knight of the Burning Pestle&#x0D; to The Changeling to 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. This sharp outline is the shadow&#x0D; that runs before an authorial canon, the larger features of which are predictable&#x0D; (Lyly, Marlowe, Dekker, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Middleton,&#x0D; Massinger, Ford) but which also change slightly as it moves from one literarycritical&#x0D; era to the next (Greene and Peele sometimes replace or supplement Lyly,&#x0D; Chapman sometimes follows Jonson, Brome and Shirley sometimes follow&#x0D; Ford). Second, whatever their local differences, early modern drama anthologies&#x0D; are consistent not only in their exclusion of plays by Shakespeare, but also in&#x0D; their selection of plays that most closely resemble Shakespeare's—that is, in&#x0D; their predilection for an essentially ""Shakespearean"" dramatic style, one that&#x0D; foregrounds poetic richness, individuated characters, and a high degree of structural&#x0D; unity. Thus, the early modern dramatic anthology is also the shadow of the&#x0D; Shakespeare canon, cast off behind (and following the contours of ) that canon&#x0D; as it is illuminated by the enduring lights of criticism, performance, pedagogy,&#x0D; and popular adulation.",,Jeremy Lopez,Journal,Shakespeare Quarterly,,,,,,The Shadow of the Canon,2014

Costa articulated —as no other member of the movement did, including his famous leader Oswald de Andrade— an Antropofagia intellectually engaged in what we call a cannibal critique of colonial modernity and Occidentalism. Costa's Antropofagia cannibalized the historical archive, reading against the grain of a triumphant Western imperial history. Throughout his contributions to the Revista de Antropofagia, he questioned Brazil's cultural allegiance to Europe, pointed out the existence of asynchronous temporalities within Brazil, and defied Eurocentric notions of civilization and progress that ideologically structure Brazilian nationalism in the ninetieth and twentieth centuries. He also enacted an anthropophagous re-reading of Brazilian historiography against its celebration of colonialism and proposed the necessity of a cultural decolonization. This article analyzes Costa's principal contributions to Antropofagia and rescues his hitherto overlooked countercolonial thought from the oblivion of collective forgetting.

12432,FA-57755-14,"This article introduces the aesthetic theory of François Delsarte (1811-1870) and his conception of semiotics. Delsarte created his ""applied aesthetics"" as a modern scientific method for artists, particularly performers, to investigate the nature of human being. Delsarte's approach to performance involved the actor in observing human behavior, interpreting it through categories of voice, gesture, and language, and rendering it in an expansive display of types. Delsarte's applied aesthetics involves the performer's attention to signs and sign action, a study he called séméiotique. We see Delsarte's program for inquiry into truth in what I call the actor's task, which develops his or her human being through observation, analysis, and creation. This was Delsarte's ""orthopedic machine for correcting crippled intellects"" – the crippled intellects being those intellectuals and conservatory teachers whose ideas on aesthetics he found to be neither systematic nor attuned to God's reason. While it is well known in theatre and dance scholarship that Delsarte's ideas and methods advanced the training of actors, dancers, and orators, particularly in the United States, my paper instead introduces him as a voice in nineteenth-century thinking on signs and semiosis. Delsarte's aesthetics are firmly based in Thomist assumptions about a triune god whose nature is reflected imperfectly in man. Yet it is striking that Delsarte characterizes the sign relation as mediated in a modern sense, prior to Charles Peirce's development of his own triadic sign relation, and semiotics as a modern method of scientific inquiry.",,Iris Smith Fischer,Journal,Semiotica,,,,,,The Role of Semeiotique in Francois Delsarte's Aesthetics,2017

12677,RZ-230604-15,"The advent of photogrammetry has resulted in the transition of photographic recording from two to three dimensions. This recording technique predominantly relies on two forms of photography: terrestrial and aerial. Ground-based photogrammetry focuses on the creation of high resolution and accurate models of in-situ archaeological remains. Conversely, aerial photography centres on the creation of detailed photogrammetric models encompassing a relatively small area through the use of kites, UAV's, and other platforms, or lower quality models of significant size, such as entire sites. Despite the importance of both ground and aerial photogrammetry, these two techniques are rarely used in tandem, generally applied to small-scale projects rather than full site models. This effectively removes terrestrial models from any site based analysis whilst conversely resulting in large scale site models being a static representation of the area at the time aerial photography was performed. This paper focuses on the methodology created for the Ancient Methone Archaeological Project, which allowed for the production of a monumental photogrammetric model (83,000 m2), viewable on both a macro and micro level via a combination of both terrestrial and aerial photographs. This methodology resulted in a level of detail, as yet unparalleled for a large-scale site model, with archaeological remains, both horizontal and vertical, visible in sub-centimetre resolution. This paper is designed to focus on photogrammetric methodology rather than a detailed analysis of the accuracy of Photoscan and its use in archaeological photogrammetry, which has been recently summarized by Sapirstein (2016).",Subscription,Hugh Thomas,Journal,Journal of Archaeological Science,,,Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports,,,Methone: terrestrial and aerial photographs,2017

These narratives have given increased visibility to Spanish deportees, forming a core aspect of Spain's historical memory. Countering Cercas's claim of morbidity, this article demonstrates that the recuperation of historical memory has moved from a grassroots movement to a legislative initiative and back again in Spain, particularly as concerns the legacy of Spanish Republicans deported to Nazi camps. Cercas's misplaced glorification of a false survivor and his narrow focus on the recuperation of historical memory as a collective memory of the Spanish Civil War and Franco dictatorship governed by the Law of Historical Memory notwithstanding, the movement has had a trickle-down effect on the visibility of the history of Spaniards deported to Nazi camps during World War II.",Subscription,Sara J.

12746,RQ-50735-13,"This essay investigates the use of cartographic metaphor in Andrea da Barberino's early modern Italian prose epic Ugone d'Alvernia. By tapping an impressive range of works on natural history, bestiary tradition, and cartographic imagery, Andrea da Barberino reworks and updates his Franco-Italian source material, the Huon d'Auvergne, to create an epic text that appeals to his Florentine merchant audience. This essay first explores geographic thought in early fifteenth-century Florence and then attempts to understand how Andrea's work resonates and conflicts with contemporary cartographic thinking and humanism. Finally, this analysis explores how Andrea deploys the metaphoric cartographic language of medieval mapping traditions to serve as a subtext to the hell journey undertaken by Ugone, count of Auvergne, the epic's protagonist.

Huon partakes of adventures and marvels while  Ynide, his wife, speaks in exempla; his travels reflect Alexander's legendary adventures, and her speeches and ordered actions (not personally accomplished) draw from classical, biblical and popular literature, the sites of which form her spouse's travels. Manuscripts of the Roman d'Alexandre appear in the same inventories as those that list Huon d'Auvergne in the Italian peninsula, so drawing these parallels is logical for the modern reader as it was for the reader in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

12749,RQ-50735-13,"The Berlin version of the chanson de geste Huon d'Auvergne ends reminding readers that it was created in honor of St. Augustine. The four versions of the chanson de geste (dated from 1341 to 1441) end differently. In the long version (Berlin, Turin, and Andrea da Barberino's prose) Huon passes twice by Rome: the first time, he has the pope bless him and receives a symbolic cross. Then this long version ends with a Saracen siege of Rome where the Germans, arriving early at the pope's call, are promised the crown of the Roman empire. Huon, who shows up later with the French army, is neither king nor clerk; but as God's envoy, he resolves conflicts not only between the pope and Saracens, but also between Germans and French. The redactor of the Berlin version emphasizes Huon's divine role in making him die for the French, a sacrificial lamb, before the end of the poem. Thus the city of Rome is both religious and political center of Europe. City of God but also of sin, the poem repeats the message of Augustine's City of God, offering a lesson to the French king through the body of his most loyal servant, Huon d'Auvergne.

Charles sends a group of ambassadors to Auvergne to bring Ynide back to Paris (where he believes he will be able to satisfy his illicit desires) after he has sent her husband on an impossible quest. Ynide succeeds in resisting the ambassadors' mission not only through rhetorical skills but also through the ""virile"" authority she exercises at her court. All the men under her command including her brothers and cousins accept her authority to determine the response to the king's ambassadors. She is the one who decides not to execute them but to punish them in such a way as to send a clear message to the king.

12753,RQ-50735-13,"Huon d'Auvergne, a chanson de geste probably of French origin, composed perhaps toward the end of the thirteenth century, survives now only in (Franco-)Italian versions of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This study is based only on the Berlin version, which dates from the first decades of the fourteenth century. One might be surprised to find that the emperor in this poem, named Charles Martel, is presented as the son of an Emperor Louis. However, the novel genealogical situation attributed to the Mayor of the Palace of the last Merovingians is explained by the need to set the action not only after the Battle of Roncevaux but also after the death of the first generation of descendants of Aymeri de Narbonne, to whom the hero, Huon, is related in this poem. On the female side, by his marriage with Ynide, the daughter of the Count of Flanders, Huon is also assimilated to one of the Crusade Cycle families. The paper investigates the importance of these multiple links to French epic cycles for the thematic structures of the poem, and especially the significance of all the hero's kinship ties for the reorientation of the song's content towards a mysticism combining elements from the Arthurian prose romance La Queste del saint Graal (The Quest for the Holy Grail) and Dante's Divine Comedy.

There are six recognizable categories of legal issues: 1) questions of sovereignty; 2) questions concerning mariage, property, inheritance, accession to power, good government, justice and the procedure for deciding them; 3) rather than discussing the right or the obligation of a woman to manage the household of her husband during his absence, Huon d'Auvergne illustrates the power of a virtuous woman; 4) all the aspects of hell imply juridical questions because they concern eternal punishment; 5) the long-standing question of imperial versus papal sovereignty over Europe; 6) the Crusades.

12755,RQ-50735-13,"This paper examines the hypothesis of a conflict between the frame narrative (the drama between Charles Martel and Huon d'Auvergne) and the supposed explanations of the torments of hell. Huon is not guilty of an involuntary sin (that of having unhorsed his disguised lord), a fault that Charles Martel has already pardoned. Rather, he is truly guilty of having humiliated his wife in public-- a fault of which he doesn't have the slightest suspicion. There is thus a gap between the non-sin of which Huon considers himself guilty and the true sin of which he is unaware. There is also a second gap. In spite of the examples of Dantean contrapasso he sees during his visit to the sites of punishment, the basis of Huon's supposed guilt is opposed to the system of punishment in hell. Thus, the questions of justice in Huon's personal history contrast with accepted ideas of intention, of contrition, and theodicy. Since Dante's Inferno demonstrates the justice of divine punition, Huon d'Auvergne does not imitate the moral system of the Florentine poet, but challenges it.  Full citation: Bernstein, Alan E.

He entered into the public sphere, however, as the subject of criticism in journalist Vance Packard's exposé The Hidden Persuaders.

Evidence in the Manhaj suggests that in the generations following al-Kha?ibi, rather than abandoning Islamic scripture as a key source, the Nu?ayri sages continued to turn to the Qur'an to elaborate doctrine. The Qur'an was interpreted to sanction correct doctrines on the nature of the godhead, bring sources ascribed to seminal figures such as Mufa??al b. ?Umar (d. before 170/795–796) into accord with the mature Nu?ayri doctrine, and censure the misbelief of cosectarians. And, contrary to recent portrayals that the period was rife with intra-sectarian conflict, the Manhaj provides evidence that during the fifth/eleventh century members of the school of al- Kha?ibi such as ?I?mat al-Dawla met with Is?aqis, the Nu?ayris' chief rival. It would seem that, as in other contexts, for the Nu?ayris, esoteric scriptural exegesis served both as a vehicle to exclude uninitiated outsiders, as well as to forge connections across intra-sectarian divides.",,David Hollenberg,Other,,,,Oxford University Press,,,Expanding orthodoxy: Nu?ayri esoteric Qur’an exegesis in the fifth/eleventh century,2022

In this article, I consider historical entanglements of rural land tenure in a coca-growing area of central Peru during the twilight years of the Shining Path insurgency. Where regionally the Maoist movement's claim to Revolution had long ceased to be plausible and its own disappearance loomed, I share an episode in which Shining Path surreptitiously manipulated the Peruvian state's administrative power so that parcels seized from a local farmer would be registered as the future legal property of its members and sympathizers. My reflections on this event unfold as a discussion of falsification and its camouflaging effects, through which I ask how shifts in political time at once animate and selectively obscure the multiplicity of social relations that bind people to material things. The bestowal of legal title itself arguably participates in obscuring the plurality of those relations—through an oblivion engendered when legal rights of other, competing, claimants are disregarded. If so, the traces of a former order of insurgent land tenure, persisting into the times of post-conflict, surely complicate such oblivion-effects. Here, the notion of that insurgent order, lingering as it were into the aftermath, serves a heuristic purpose: it draws ethnographic attention to the afterlives of defeated land claims and to the life plans those claims once conveyed.",subscription only,Richard Kernaghan,Journal,,https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/35/article/670933,,Anthropological Quarterly,,,Oblivious Title: On the Political Time of Land Tenure in Postwar Peru,2017

However, as with any far-reaching philosophical commitment, Regis's gambit comes with substantive costs of its own, including creating instabilities within the core of his own philosophical system.

The Index excluded most objects made by Native, African, and Asian Americans and instead sought out ""folk art"" produced by relatively isolated or archaic groups descended from European immigrants.

23821,FEL-262889-19,"Abstract:  Among Epicurus' On Nature 25 arguments against determinism, the view that everything comes to be by accidental necessity (kata to automaton anangkên), is a previously-unnoticed semantic argument.  Epicurus argues that since our preconception (prolêpsis) of causal responsibility (aitia), or of being causally responsible (aitios), originates in our experience (pathos) of acting through ourselves (di' hêmôn autôn), the thesis of determinism is self-refuting.  This is because the thesis of determinism requires use of the preconception of causal responsibility, which would not be available to the determinist if it were true that everything that happens, including our actions and experiences, is caused by necessity from our original constitution and environment.  In the wake of this argument, Epicurus challenges the determinist to show that we should not consider our own agency to belong to the preconception of causal responsibility, and to explain the difference between our experiences of voluntary and compelled action.

To that end, we investigate the use of causal notions in Antiphon's Second Tetralogy, a 5th century text consisting of arguments from prosecution and defense in a fictional legal case concerning unintentional homicide.  We argue that while the prosecution maintains that causal responsibility, conceived in terms of production, is sufficient for legal responsibility, the defense undermines this judgment by arguing, first, that the javelin-throwing youth is a patient rather than agent of a mistake/missing-the-target and second, that the boy's death depends on his action of running into the path of the javelin, so that identifying the cause or the agent responsible requires evaluating the contrasts implicit in any causal claim.  Appreciating Antiphon's deft deployment of the two different concepts of cause allows us to see that neither Antiphon, nor his speakers, nor the Athenian law confuse the distinction between causal and evaluative responsibility, contrary to what previous commentators have maintained.

I classify ancient Greek puppetry into two main types: the phallic puppets used in religious processions in the Eastern Mediterranean, and small-scale puppetry, which was performed in theaters and possibly also in private contexts. I contend that puppetry was not universally considered an insignificant art but was, rather, an important part of the performance culture of the ancient Mediterranean world. The inclusion of puppetry in religious festivals suggests a positive relationship with this art; reactions to puppetry, from laughter to thauma (wonder), align with the aims of the festivals which hosted such performances.","online, open access",Mali Skotheim,Journal,Open Library of Humanities,doi:10.16995/olh.6568,publisher's access to article,Elsevier,,,The Puppet and the Puppet-Master in Ancient Greece:  Fragments of an Art Form,2022

23906,RA-264466-19,"Delving into an ephemeral 1940s Cairene magazine and conducting oral history, this essay focalizes an unrecorded Egyptian–Indian moment wedged between the two countries' anti-imperial cooperation in the 1920s and 1930s, and their postindependence solidarity most visible in the 1955 Bandung Conference. The textual material is in the nature of a representation of India, suffused with identification; the oral history yields a virtually unknown Egyptian–Indian solidarity among student networks. Far from claiming to cover any and all engagements with things Indian in 1940s Egypt, the essay argues that the supranationalism of the specific Egyptian dialogue with India tackled here, while squarely anti-imperial, acquires more pronounced socialist internationalist hues due to a much-invigorated stage in the Egyptian left. Recouping that moment enables us to form a more nuanced picture of the later, postindependence internationalism, attuning us to various precursor orientations that fed into it, if in unremarked ways. Dwelling on these instances of 1940s internationalism resists the tendency to subsume the later Third Worldist internationalisms under the shadow of the Cold War, notwithstanding their imbrication within it. And yet this intervention is non-teleological: the conclusion considers the implications— the continuities as much as the discontinuities—of the 1940s moment for the succeeding Afro-Asian Third Worldism.",n/a,Hala Halim,Journal,"Comparative Literature Studies, vol. 59, no. 1 (2022): 49-76; special issue on “New Critical Directions in Global South Studies",http://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/cls/article-pdf/59/1/49/1488780/complitstudies 59 1 49.pdf,,Penn State University Press,,,"A Theatre—or, More Aptly, a Laboratory’: India in the 1940s Egyptian Left as an Antecedent of Bandung Internationalism",2022

Drawing on existing architecture, oral histories, and proposed future floor plans, this article evaluates the potential motivations behind seemingly inconsequential changes between the houses built at Lattimer No. 2 and the proposed houses to be built at Lattimer No. 3 in northeastern Pennsylvania. Although the power structures inherent in company towns afforded the company control over every aspect of their workers' lives, a review of architectural changes to workers' houses over time reveals how the manipulation of physical space promoted community surveillance, increased formality, and decreased interaction with neighbors. While subtle, these types of modifications indicate a shift in the relationship between the company and its workers and can provide more insight into the experiences of workers in coal-company towns.",,V.

Do they see the ludicrousness of the situation in which self-evident core values are proposed as a shared dream for everyone? The general impression is that they do not. Perhaps they are not in a structural position to share the laughter of the people. Classically in China, the sovereign is not allowed to joke.28 Where the lord's word is law, it would not do for him do to engage in wordplay or paradoxical foolishness. The fact that modern leaders of fractious republics famously do so—Mao's witticisms are different from but not less clever than those of John Kennedy or Barack Obama—must be an index of the modernity of power in nation-states. Jokes bubble up at all levels in the everyday life of state power in China, as they do in other modern nation-states. The murmur of billions of sarcastic text messages, so many of which twist and challenge the proprieties of power, persuades us that the premodern imperium is no more. The system of cosmo-political lordship for which every imperial word was a decree and which tabooed the names of the sacred powerful is long gone. In the People's Republic of China, a very secular sovereignty addresses the multitude; it recognizes, relies upon, and thus disciplines the many modes of existence of the consumers of state communications. Unlike the provincial rube in the men's room, the people insist on some carnal necessities, and when the message fails to connect with actual life, they simply forget to consume it.  But that leaves us with a truly puzzling question: why is the Propaganda Ministry so humorless, why are its cute dreaming babies so flat-footed? If we could answer this question, reading the state agenda expressed in a media environment through the ephemeral laughter of the public, we might draw closer to an understanding of how contemporary sovereignty works.

This essay describes concomitant developments in the empire's Persianate political language, particularly with regard to ideas of sovereignty, statehood, and dominion. It argues that by the mid-eighteenth century, the Mughal ""empire of Hindustan"" was increasingly framed as a territorialised governing institution comprising emerging provincial sovereignties rooted in local ruling households. This conceptual dispensation, however, remained ill-defined until the 1760s, when a treaty regime dominated by the Company built upon this language to concretise the empire as a confederacy of independent, sub-imperial states.

Chief consort (khass mahal) to Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula (r. 1754–75) and mother to his successor Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula (r. 1775–97), Bahu Begam played a well-documented role in the regime's tumultuous politics, particularly during Warren Hastings's tenure as the Company's governor-general (1773–85) and his later parliamentary impeachment. But despite her prominent political influence, little attention has been paid to the substance of her persistent claims to proprietorship over revenue rights and the immense fortune in her custody, as well as her broader assertions of authority over Awadh's male rulers. Taking those claims seriously, this article contends that the begam rooted her arguments in notions of natural deference to maternal authority and generational seniority, evolving dynastic traditions of co-sharing sovereignty and fiscal resources, and her particular history as a principal financier of the Awadh regime. In so doing, the article argues that the begam's claims reflect the shifting conceptual language of late-Mughal Persianate political discourse and the ambivalent position of elite women as dynastic financiers and state-builders in early colonial South Asia.",Open access,Nicholas J.

24076,RA-285526-22,"This article centers on the life of Bilal Ould Mahmoud, an enslaved man who became a spiritual authority in the nineteenth-century Sahara. It examines how Bilal's piety allowed him to rise to prominence in a hierarchical context that subjugated him to an inferior position. Yet what makes him so fascinating to study is his ability to achieve the highest station as a Sufi saint without being attached to a Sufi order. Using Bilal's case, this article makes two important contributions to the historiographies of Sufism and slavery.

It argues that the mobilization of digital performance technologies in Zhici qinglü and other contemporary large-scale performance in the PRC generates what might be termed ""surface classicism""—an engagement with the past that sublimates elements of classical art, literature, imagery, and tropes into the realm of digitally enhanced visuality. Such remediations lend themselves to critiques of superficiality and inauthenticity, but this article argues that the ubiquity of surface classicism in contemporary culture in fact creates new networks of relationality among remediations of classical poetics and imagery. Ultimately, the mediation of both live performance and spectacular performance technologies in contemporary, digitally enhanced performance works to establish classicist poetics and imagery as a core element of shared contemporary Chinese culture and may even engender new, more accessible modes of classical erudition.",Subscription,Tarryn Li-Min Chun,Journal,Prism: Theory and Modern Chinese Literature,https://www.dukeupress.edu/prism,Journal homepage,Duke University Press,,,"Surface Classicism: Aesthetics, Poetics, and Remediation in Digitally Enhanced Chinese Performance",2024
24088,HAA-277220-21,"In this article we provide a case study in the datafication of historical handwritten manuscripts, which diversifies the repertoire, approaches, demographics, and institutional partnerships of MIR. The Kiselgof-Makonovetsky Digital Manuscript Project (KMDMP) is a community-based project to digitize music and text, teach, and make music from facsimiles of manuscripts held by the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine. The corpus comprises 850 high-resolution photographs of handwritten music manuscripts and catalog pages, with a total of around 1,300 melodies. Much of the music was collected by pioneering Belarusian ethnographer Zusman Kiselgof among Jewish communities in the ‘Pale of Settlement' (mostly in modern Ukraine and Belarus) during the An-Ski Expeditions of 1912–1914. The repertoire is mixed, combining typical Jewish dance and non-dance genres, European society and folklore dance music, and a relatively small quantity of songs and liturgical chant settings. The project simultaneously encodes music in formats accessible to computational musicology and enhances a creative musical community and deeply valued heritage. We introduce the project in dialogue with a recent article by Georgina Born on diversity in the field of MIR; present the material, issues for datafication, and results thus far; describe project elements that enhance musical community; demonstrate the diversity of participants with respect to age, gender, nationality, and profession; outline implications for MIR and computational ethnomusicology; and suggest new funding models and partnerships in support of cultural heritage documentation, preservation, continuity, and analysis.",Open Access,"Yonatan Malin, Christina Crowder, Clara Byom, Daniel Shanahan",Journal,Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval,https://transactions.ismir.net/articles/10.5334/tismir.135,,Ubiquity Press,,,Community Based Music Information Retrieval: A Case Study of Digitizing Historical Klezmer Manuscripts from Kyiv,2022

Are his arguments as pathetic as many theorists make them out to be – from Machiavelli to contemporary political realists?  This question has been surprisingly unasked, and it is one I address by asking Plato and his  critics:  What are the dialectical moves Plato makes in refuting Socrates's opponents and constructing his own conception of legitimate (i.e., just) power?  Exactly how does his conception of power reflect a kind of ethics?  How does it compare to recent conceptions of political realism and  the power/ethics relationship – e.g., after Marx and Foucault?  While asking these questions I also attend to the issue of Plato's historicity: to what extent do the limits of his language and world affect our reading of Plato and his political critics?

The motives for Barker's change were intermingled, having as much to do with emotion, economics, drinking, and empire as with the criterion of reasonableness. The key moment of his transition, however, is conceptually more straightforward. It was his rejection of the doctrine of original sin. And in this sense Barker points to something much larger: a doctrinal shift that stands at the threshold between confessional and Enlightenment Europe.

In this article Dassia N. Posner analyzes and contextualizes two of these productions: The Hairy Ape (1926) and Machinal (1933). By the mid-1920s, Kamerny Theatre director Alexander Tairov was under intense pressure to stage work that aligned with the Soviet Union's political goals. A significant portion of the Kamerny's repertoire had long consisted of foreign plays that celebrated the individual's struggle against oppression. The Hairy Ape and Machinal provided Tairov with a unique opportunity to combine artistic, political, and human relevance in a way he had not achieved before, using the artistic language of the theatre's earlier stylistic and acting innovations. Drawing on rich archival sources, Posner illuminates ways in which stylistic juxtaposition allowed these productions to address a specific political context while also reflecting on oppression more broadly as it relates to class, gender, national origin, artistic freedom, and individual thought.

12972,FT-61611-14,"This paper reads Hu Fayun's 2006 novel Ruyan@sars.come in order to articulate the concept of totalitarian ordinariness.  This concept, I argue, can usefully disrupt two persistent western tropes of ""the world"" in the new millennium: (1) totalitarianism as a relentlessly nightmarish state of crisis, one that belongs to the political other (such as communist China) but remains a threat to be kept at bay, and (2) pandemics as an inescapable reality in the age of globalization, one whose potential scope is exacerbated by exotic third-world cultural practices and recalcitrant undemocratic states, what I call pandemic orientalism.  Both discourses offer an alarming vision of the contemporary world, defined by geopolitical or microbial dangers arising from or magnified by the non-West, and in 2003, they converged on China during the SARS outbreak.  These discourses, however, rarely consider writings from the imagined locales of crisis, and when they do, they tend to zero in on authors, texts, or textual moments that reinforce prevailing tropes (the Anglophone marketing around Yan Lianke's Dream of Ding Village being one prime example).  Ruyan@sars.come, offering another model of the Chinese epidemic novel, is organized around not just an explicit censure of the communist government's handling of the SARS outbreak but also an emphasis on the everyday and mundane, including a central plotline on middle-aged romance.

13033,FA-251744-17,"Rumors run rife in areas affected by political instability and conflict. Their adoption plays a key role in igniting many forms of violence, including riots, ethnic conflict, genocide, and war. While unverified at the time of transmission, some rumors are widely treated as truth, while others are dismissed as implausible or false. What factors lead individuals to embrace rumors and other forms of unverified information? This article presents a new theoretical framework for understanding individual receptivity to rumors and tests it using original survey data gathered in insurgency-affected areas of Thailand and the Philippines. We find wide variation in rumor adoption, and argue that three factors drive individuals to embrace rumors: worldview, threat perception, and prior exposure. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find no evidence that commonly cited factors—including education, income, age, and gender—determine individual receptivity to rumors. We also explore the implications of belief in rumors on conflict dynamics. We find that greater receptivity to rumors correlates with the belief that ongoing conflict is intractable. This suggests that rumors can not only help spark political violence, but also impede its resolution. Our findings shed light on the complex interaction between worldview and unverified information in shaping popular beliefs—and through them, political contention and competition—in conflict areas and beyond.",Subscription,Kelly M.

13064,FA-232534-16,"The Russian Orthodox Church never experienced a movement that placed the authority of Scriptures over that of the Church, as was characteristic of the Protestant reformations in Western Europe. Nevertheless, an increased emphasis on the Scriptures and a desire to translate the Bible into the vernacular arose in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in Russia. Aside from the work of the Russian Bible Society, scholars have not shed much light on this trend as it occurred within clerical education. This article argues that the episode of the Bible Society was a critical chapter within a larger story of important theological and pedagogical shifts within Russian Orthodox education and values. The roots of the Russian biblical translation effort extend back to the eighteenth century, when ethnic Russian clerical scholars gained the linguistic abilities in Greek and Hebrew to translate based on the ancient texts, and when more attention began to be paid to both vernacular Russian instruction and Scriptural study in the ecclesiastical schools. These trends flourished more deeply in the first half of the nineteenth century, with the rise of romantic nationalism and the evangelical message of the Bible Society. Thus, although Russia did not undergo a Reformation in the Western sense of the word, the Orthodox Church went through an internal reassessment of its teachings and approach to the Word of God that brought the Scriptures into a more central role without undermining Church authority and tradition.",,Barbara J.

Does empathy modulate neural responses to musical sounds? We designed two fMRI experiments to address this question. In Experiment 1, subjects listened to brief isolated musical timbres while being scanned. In Experiment 2, subjects listened to excerpts of music in four conditions (familiar liked/disliked and unfamiliar liked/disliked). For both types of musical stimuli, emotional and cognitive forms of trait empathy modulated activity in sensorimotor and cognitive areas: in the first experiment, empathy was primarily correlated with activity in SMA, IFG, and insula; in experiment 2, empathy was mainly correlated with activity in prefrontal, temporo-parietal, and reward areas.

Perceptual studies have revealed a number of verbal attributes that reliably map onto timbral qualities, but the conventions of timbre description in spoken and written discourse remain poorly understood. Books on orchestration provide a valuable source of natural language about instrumental timbre. This article uses methods from corpus linguistics to explore the semantic features of timbre through a quantitative analysis of 11 orchestration treatises and manuals. Findings reveal a relatively constrained vocabulary for timbre: about 50 adjectives account for half of all descriptions in the corpus. The timbre lexicon can be categorized according to affect, matter, metaphor, mimesis, action, acoustics, and onomatopoeia, and further reduced to three latent conceptual dimensions, which are labeled and discussed. Descriptive patterns vary systematically by instrument and instrument family, suggesting certain regularities and consistencies to timbre description in the orchestral tradition. This study helps test the long-held assumption that conventions of timbre description are vague and unsystematic, and offers a cognitive linguistic account of the timbre-language connection.",Subscription only,"Wallmark, Zachary",Journal,Psychology of Music,,,Sage,,,A corpus analysis of timbre semantics in orchestration treatises,2018

However, little attention has been paid to timbre as a possible mediator between musical embodiment and affect. In three experiments, we investigated the embodied dimensions of timbre perception by focusing on timbral qualities considered ‘‘noisy'' and aversive. In Experiment 1, participants rated brief isolated natural timbres scaled into ordinal levels of ""noisiness."" Experiment 2 employed the same design with a focus on polyphonic timbre, using brief (400 ms) excerpts from 6 popular music genres as stimuli. In Experiment 3, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore neural activations associated with perception of stimuli from Experiment 1. Converging results from behavioral, acoustical, and fMRI data suggest a motor component to timbre processing, particularly timbral qualities considered ""noisy,"" indicating a possible enactive mechanism in timbre processing. Activity in somatomotor areas, insula, and the limbic system increased the more participants disliked a timbre, and connectivity between the premotor cortex and insula relay decreased.

A core goal of the project is the use of computational biology, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to investigate authorial style, intertextuality, and related phenomena of literary significance. As a case study in our approach, here we review the use of sequence alignment, a common technique in genomics and computational linguistics, to detect intertextuality in Latin literature. Sequence alignment is distinguished by its ability to find inexact verbal similarities, which makes it ideal for identifying phonetic echoes in large corpora of Latin texts.

13192,RA-50115-12,"At the turn of the 20th century, agricultural experts in several countries assembled a new agro-scientific field: dryland farming. Their agricultural research practices concomitantly fashioned a new agro-ecological zone—the drylands—as the site of agronomic intervention. As part of this effort, American scientists worked in concert with colleagues in the emerging Zionist movement to investigate agricultural practices and crops in Palestine and neighboring regions, where nonirrigated or rainfed agriculture had long been practiced. In my larger manuscript project, I consider how the reorganization of rainfed farming as dryfarming is central to the history of both the Middle East and North America, where it was closely related to modern forms of power, sovereignty, and territoriality. I suggest that American interest in dryfarming science emerged out of a practical need to propel and sustain colonization of the Great Plains, but later became a joint effort of researchers from several emerging settler enterprises, including Australia, Canada, and the Zionist movement. In contrast to a naturally ocurring bioregion, I argue that the drylands spatiality was engineered through, rather than outside, the territorialization of modern power.",,Omar Tesdell,Journal,"International Journal of Middle East Studies, Volume 47, Issue 3",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020743815000586,,,,,Territoriality and the technics of drylands science in Palestine and North America,2015

13225,RA-50078-09,"The Justice and Development Party (AKP), which has been ruling Turkey since 2002, was founded by a splinter group from within the Islamist Virtue Party (FP). The most obvious difference between the old guard of the FP and the younger, reformist cadres who established the AKP was the latter's deliberate and efficacious implementation of the discourse of democracy and human rights in articulating their political agenda. This discursive shift not only increased the AKP's votes, but also gained them many supporters among liberal intellectuals in Turkey and abroad, who saw in them a potential to reconcile Islam with democracy. So much was invested in this hopeful vision that pro-AKP liberals for a long time turned a blind eye to many contrary developments in the country or tried to diminish their significance. One such major blind spot has been the Alevis, who after nearly 14 years of AKP rule continue to face formal and informal discrimination on a daily basis. Despite their alleged commitment to religious freedom, and notwithstanding an ephemeral ‘Alevi opening' in 2007–2008, the disenfranchisement of the Alevis has only deepened under the AKP with its accelerated top-down Islamization of broader Turkish society and the corollary intensification of sectarian discourse both in domestic and foreign policy.",on-line,Ayfer Karakaya-Stump,Journal,National Identities,DOI: 10.1080/14608944.2016.1244935,article access,Taylor and Francis,,,"The AKP, sectarianism, and the Alevis’ struggle for equal rights in Turkey",2017

Alegato jurídico, sentencia performativa, mensaje dirigido a los pueblos del mundo, acta de nacimiento de un país, las declaraciones de independencia formaron parte ineludible de los movimientos revolucionarios en América, desde Filadelfia en 1776 hasta Chuquisaca en 1825. Este libro estudia la era de las revoluciones atlánticas a través de sus declaraciones, actas y manifiestos. Redactados por periodistas, clérigos o militares, por juntas o congresos (no siempre electos), estos documentos en ocasiones engendraron procesos largos y desgastantes, y en otras les pusieron punto final. Las declaraciones de independencia han constituido piezas clave de los muy variados repertorios del nacionalismo, desde las revoluciones del siglo XVlll hasta los procesos de descolonización africano y asiático en la segunda mitad del XX, e incluso en los albores del XXl, como lo demuestra la declaración de independencia de Kosovo, proclamada en febrero de 2008.

13353,RA-235157-16,"""Coming to Castile with Cortés: Indigenous ‘Servitude' in the Sixteenth Century"" examines the circumstances of three indigenous criados (servants)—Pedro, Juan, and Francisco Manuel—with direct or indirect ties of patronage to the Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortés. As nonelite indios (Indians) displaced from Mexico to Castile, they experienced the transition from freedom to bondage in unique ways. Because the New Laws (1542) stated that, in principle, indios could be free in Spanish territories, all three initiated lawsuits before the tribunals of the House of Trade or the Council of the Indies. The trial depositions reveal the circumscribed life narratives of free indios whom others saw as slaves and whose lives were entwined with others more powerful than they. Each life story emphasizes the importance of hierarchical relations of power among masters, slaves, and servants, writ large in sixteenth-century Castile.",,"Van Deusen, Nancy",Journal,Ethnohistory,https://read.dukeupress.edu/ethnohistory/article/62/2/285/9243/Coming-to-Castile-with-Cortes-Indigenous-Servitude,,Duke University Press,,,"Coming to Castile with Cortes: indigenous ""servitude"" in the sixteenth century",2015
13354,RA-50076-09,"When metals are mentioned in early American histories, they tend to be the fabled gold of New World spaces (""El Dorado""), or the silver bullion of world trade (reales). But less noble metals tell equally important stories about the colonial past. This article analyzes promotional literatures from seventeenth-century Virginia and Venezuela to show how two writers converted a moment of currency crisis in early modern Europe and uneven metallic trade with Asia and Africa into new modes of imperial projecting in the early Americas. Over time, John Smith and Manuel Gaytán de Torres told and retold their stories, shaping their visions of colonial settlement into proposals that both reinforced and challenged their audiences' desires. They followed the malleable potential of copper metals and the three stages of copper metallurgy to shape new narratives of possibility for indigenous, African, and European communities in Tsenacommacah and Cocorote, and to cast these narratives into diverse textual forms, such as shape poems, maps, paintings, relations, and histories.",,Allison Bigelow,Journal,,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/686057,,Early American Studies,,,"“Imperial Projecting in Virginia and Venezuela: Copper, Colonialism, and the Printing of Possibility.”",2018
13357,RA-228581-15,"This special issue of the journal asks how the violence of the archives of slavery contributes to the production of a history of our present. What is at stake in revisiting the devastation and death contained in the documents of slavery? And is such a revisiting even possible? As several of the authors note, all archives are incomplete—such historical accounts written primarily by the most powerful have overwhelmingly informed our understanding of the past. But what is it about the archives of slavery, the more than 400-year span of forced labor and death of Africans that requires that we pause to consider their particular silences? It is partly about violence—the varied forms of violence on black bodies in slavery that created the conditions by which they are made invisible, mutilated and difficult to reach; they are not easily articulated or narrated in the historical accounts. Even as we formulate new methods that challenge archival power, some things remain unrecoverable, silent.

Sugiere que las dos caras de la moneda cientí?ca en los Andes: el vocabulario ""erudito"" y el lenguaje ""cotidia-no"", demuestran varios e importantes intercambios intelectuales y materiales que in?uían en la formación de la ciencia híbrida de la colonia. ?al como el arte y la literatura de la región andina en los siglos XVI-XVII, las técnicas sincréticas de la minería andina resisten clasi?caciones binarias entre lo escrito y lo oral, el saber indígena y la ciencia europea. Por tanto, en el análisis se aborda dos términos claves: la dote y el amor, y dos conceptos principales: la complementariedad genérica del hombre y la mujer y la transferencia tecnológica entre la agricultura y la minería, dos industrias importantes en las sociedades precolombinas y coloniales.El estudio se enfoca principalmente en un análisis de las analogías cientí?cas entre el cuerpo femenino y las relaciones de género así representadas en las obras de José de Acosta (1590), el    Manuscrito de Huarochirí    (h. 1608), Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala (h. 1615) y Álvaro Alonso Barba (1640). La evidencia de estas diversas fuentes indica que la producción de alimentos (la agricultura) y el tributo económico-espiritual (la minería), dependía de explicaciones cientí?cas y cosmológicas que re?ejaban la realidad experimentada en los íntimos entornos de la vida familiar.

24122,FEL-273562-21,"This paper examines the role that the demand for self-integration, or for an inner systematic order and harmony, plays for Kant's conceptions of personhood, moral agency, and happiness. In contrast to a self-constitution view, such as that of Korsgaard (2009), it argues for a self-formation view, according to which the demand for self-integration is a regulative rather than constitutive principle for the psychological constitution of a person and a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of moral character. In the first part, the demand for self-integration is identified with the regulative principles of the non-moral idea of the soul, which have a normative function for the self-understanding and self-formation of persons. The second part focuses on its role in moral action and discusses whether the demand for self-integration is a necessary pre-condition for morality, and in particular for the formation of moral character. It answers this question by exploring three ways in which humans may fail to meet this demand. The third part examines whether compliance with this demand can contribute to personal happiness and considers possible external constraints to which the demand might be subject, given the state of the world (nature) as well as the will and psychological constitution of other people.",,Katharina Kraus,,,,,In preparation for publication with journal,,,"Kant on the Rational Ideal of Harmony: The Demand for Self-Integration, Moral Agency, and Happiness",2023
24123,FEL-273562-21,"This paper explores an important shift in the conception of personhood from Locke to Kant. Locke famously accounts for personal identity by appealing to the capacity to be conscious of oneself at different times, rather than to an underlying ontological substance. Although Locke's theory has remained influential to this day, it fails to solve the problem of error in appropriating thoughts and actions in the same consciousness. This failure reveals a dilemma between subjectivism and foundationalism in which Locke and the Lockeans are caught. Kant, while crucially influenced by Locke's consciousness-based view, radically transforms Locke's approach: by developing a normative conception of personhood, Kant is able to offer an effective answer to the problem of error. Specifically, Kant conceives of personal identity neither as the product of a subjective faculty nor as an objectively given reality, but rather as a normative demand for a person's self-activity, which centrally involves psychological integration through time.",,Katharina Kraus,,,,,Currently under revision,,,From Locke’s Problem of Error to Kant’s Normative Idea of Personal Identity,2022
24128,PR-263931-19,"Aural heritage research documents, reconstructs, and preserves the sonic interactivity of sites important to humans across time and around the world. Here, we discuss acoustical data acquisition per the definition of aural heritage we proposed: ""spatial acoustics as physically experienced by humans in cultural contexts."" Two factors support ecological validity (realism). First, the use of places change over time, so aural heritage documentation and reconstruction should be informed by contextual knowledge of both present-day situations as well as past scenarios suggested by historical records or archaeological materials. Second, and our focus here: aural heritage documentation requires acoustical measurements that represent humanly plausible perspectives on a soundfield, including measurements that document human-surface relationships. To ensure accuracy in the presentation of reconstructions of past acoustics to present-day humans, it is necessary to understand how spatial acoustical data translate across different audio rendering systems used for auralizations. Our ""human-centered"" approach to data collection addresses ecological validity in aural heritage preservation, and in concurrent research we have conducted perceptual evaluations of soundfields reconstructed from these data in multichannel listening rooms. Aural heritage data collection and auralization research require separate methodologies that intersect in the presentation of past acoustics to present-day listeners.",,"Miriam A.

24129,PR-263931-19,"In this research, we investigated the influence of congruent visual media on the recognition of spatial audio attributes in a multimodal virtual reality context. For the immersive auditory data, we recorded solo piano music using three multichannel microphone techniques: a 5-channel conventional surround microphone technique, and a 7-channel and a 9-channel immersive microphone array that both include height-channel microphones. In total, 38 normal-hearing participants were invited to the experiment and separated into two groups for presenting immersive audio with and without congruent visual media. The visual data was collected using a 360-degree camera and projected to a 250-degree wraparound screen for immersive visual rendering. Participants were asked to rate the timbral and spatial attributes for each of the three immersive auditory presentations (solo piano music via the three multichannel recording techniques), and to provide an overall preference rating by using a continuous quality scale (CQS). Experiment results show that the presentation of congruent visual media modulates reported perceptions of auditory attributes from simultaneously presented immersive audio. The experiment demonstrated that the presence of a realistic visual image congruent to the presented auditory material made listeners require higher spatial auditory fidelity in the immersive multimodal context. Consequently, this study's findings can be used to inform immersive and holistic audiovisual and interaction design.",,"Xuan Lu, Sungyoung Kim, Miriam Kolar, Doyuen Ko","Journal, Other","Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Acoustics (ICA 2022), Gyeongju, South Korea, October 2022",https://auralheritage.org/publications/ICA2022Proceedings LuEtAl.pdf,,"24th International Conference on Acoustics (ICA 2022), Gyeongju, South Korea, October 2022",,,Influence of the presence of congruent visual media on spatial auditory fidelity,2022

24130,PR-263931-19,"In order to exploit strengths and avoid weaknesses of the First Order Ambisonics (FOA) microphone technique, we devised a new, portable 3D microphone recording technique, ""W-Ambisonics."" This new technique incorporates a spaced stereo cardioid microphone pair (for frontal information) with two FOA microphone arrays (for lateral, rear, and height information). In W-Ambisonics, two FOA microphones are spaced 17cm apart to capture and represent interaural cues precisely, with two cardioid microphones spaced 50cm apart, 50cm in front, which improves frontal directionality. Varying the elevation of the cardioid pair enhances spatialization techniques such as reproduction with height channels. The combination of these two microphone pairs enables the translation of recorded audio into various reproduction formats according to practical limitations in reproduction peripherals. The design focus of this technique was efficiency in the recording stage and scalability in the reproduction stage. We conducted three perceptual experiments whose results show that the W-Ambisonics method enables improved lateral localization, provides comparable sound quality to the conventional spaced array technique, and translates spacious yet precise sound images in listening evaluations of a binauralized headphone rendering. The W-Ambisonics microphone technique is practical, precise, and scalable across multiple reproduction scenarios, from binaural to multichannel systems.",,"Doyuen Ko, Xuan Lu, Sungyoung Kim, Miriam Kolar","Journal, Other","Audio Engineering Society Convention e-Brief, Presented at the 151st Convention 2021 October",https://auralheritage.org/publications/LuEtAl2021 AES W Ambisonics.pdf,,Audio Engineering Society (AES),,,"Perceptual evaluation of a new, portable three-dimensional recording technique: “W-Ambisonics”",2021

24265,FEL-272961-21,"How can a reflective scientist put forward an explanation using a model when they are aware that many of the assumptions used to specify that model are false? This paper addresses this challenge by making two substantial assumptions about explanatory practice. First, many of the propositions deployed in the course of explaining have a non-representational function. In particular, a proposition that a scientist uses and also believes to be false, i.e. an ""idealization"", typically has some non-representational function in the practice, such as the interpretation of some model or the specification of the target of the explanation. Second, when an agent puts forward an explanation using a model, they usually aim to remain agnostic about various features of the phenomenon being explained. In this sense, explanations are intended to be autonomous from many of the more fundamental features of such systems. I support these two assumptions by showing how they allow one to address a number of recent concerns raised by Bokulich, Potochnik and Rice. In addition, these assumptions lead to a defense of the view that explanations are wholly true that improves on the accounts developed by Craver, Mäki and Strevens.",Subscription,Christopher Pincock,Journal,Erkenntnis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-020-00371-9,Article link.,Springer,,,A Defense of Truth as a Necessary Condition on Explanation,2023

This discussion of concrete models is pursued using a detailed case study of some recent models of landslide generated impulse waves. Practitioners show a clear awareness of the idealized character of these models, and yet address these concerns through a number of methods. This paper focuses on experimental arguments that show how certain failures to accurately represent feature X are consistent with accurately representing some causes of feature Y, even when X is causally relevant to Y. To analyse these arguments, the claims generated by a model must be carefully examined and grouped into types. Only some of these types can be endorsed by practitioners, but I argue that these endorsed claims are sufficient for limited forms of causal explanation.",Subscription,Christopher Pincock,Journal,British Journal for the Philosophy of Science,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1093/bjps/axz019,Article link,University of Chicago Press,,,"Concrete Scale Models, Essential Idealization and Causal Explanation",2022

24288,HAA-258717-18,"Digital resources like the HathiTrust Digital Library, Early English Books Online, and Eighteenth-Century Collections Online are increasingly central to humanities scholarship, a trend that has only accelerated as academic jobs disappear, institutional budgets tighten, and an ongoing global pandemic limits travel and access to archives. These electronic resources are not simply a panacea in precarious times, however; they are the product of a global information economy that depends on uncredited, invisible, and underpaid labor. The academic humanities are complicit in exploiting and erasing these technology workers, as a growing body of investigative research has shown. This essay contributes a new case study of an offshore outsourcing project commissioned by and for eighteenth-century scholars: the digitization of The London Stage, 1660–1800 by China Data Systems Corporation in 1970. That electronic transcription, which continues to underpin the present-day London Stage Database, was performed by women keypunchers whose labor was systematically feminized, racialized, and devalued in advertisements and corporate media. Drawing connections to the rhetoric around projects like Google Books and the Text Creation Partnership today, I highlight the recurrent figure of the hand and its vexed role in policing the boundaries between agential and alienated labor. Turning to the period that gave rise to contemporary understandings of intellectual property, I conclude by examining a receipt recording three copyright sales between Susanna Centlivre and Edmund Curll. In this ephemeral manuscript, I find a story richly suggestive of how we might reimagine scholarly labor and knowledge work in our moment of technocapitalism.","Subscription only, with preprint available in open access",Mattie Burkert,Journal,Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture,https://doi.org/10.1353/sec.2023.0036,Offprint of published article via Project Muse (subscription required),Johns Hopkins University Press,https://mattieburkert.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/burkert secc final-ms website.pdf,Preprint hosted on author website in accordance with publishing contract.,From Manual to Digital: Women’s Hands and the Work of Eighteenth-Century Studies,2023
24289,HAA-258717-18,"This essay traces popular characters named ""Nobody"" and ""Somebody"" across the theatrical culture of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England, beginning with the anonymous play Nobody and Somebody (1606) and moving through Henry Fielding's The Author's Farce (1730) to a series of prologues and epilogues performed throughout the 1740s and 1750s. I argue that this performance tradition encoded a critique of the ways credit culture abstracted identity, deferred agency, and replaced face-to-face social obligations with impersonal debt structures. The Nobody and Somebody phenomenon therefore offers a window onto early modern conceptualizations of precarity, as defined by Lauren Berlant: the interplay between the universal, existential vulnerability of being human and the specific instabilities and cruelties of life under capitalism. Ultimately, these figures reveal the power of the stage—a site that privileges embodiment, sensory experience, and material presence—to critique an economic system that insistently abstracts human life.

At times, I hone in on South and Southeast Los Angeles, a part of Los Angeles where housing always had a dimension of informality to it, reflecting the strategies and needs of working-class residents struggling to get by. For generations, they maximized the productive potentials of their property to help make ends meet, set within the context of suburbia—towns with single-family detached homes, yards, and families. As the ethnic profile of southern Los Angeles changed, those efforts met with harsher challenges and barriers. In a nutshell, informal housing began as an auspicious opportunity for working-class whites in the 1920s, took on patriotic overtones during World War II, and then was essentially racialized and criminalized by the 1980s when the area flipped from white to Latino. Informal housing was suppressed right at a moment when housing need was exploding. This history reveals how housing policy became entwined with immigration policy at the local level, creating formidable barriers to solving L.A.'s on-going shelter problem.",open access,Becky Nicolaides,Other,,https://boomcalifornia.org/2019/01/31/from-resourceful-to-illegal/,,Boom California,,,"""From Resourceful to Illegal: The Racialized History of Garage Housing in Los Angeles""",2019

Our approach identifies and analyzes expressions of values found within the organizational discourse of a large-scale intervention at national parks oriented toward the social inclusion of people who are blind or have low-vision. Researchers and organizations can use this model to create commonground opportunities within values-sensitive gamified designs. Method: We collected qualitative and quantitative data via multiple methods and from different perspectives in an effort to strengthen validity as well as to better determine what all types of stakeholders really wanted out of the gamified experience. From a pre-survey to a list of intervention activities to a post-survey, we deconstructed discourse and coded for values, then compared across sets to evaluate the presence of values and their alignment/misalignment among participants and the intervention designers. Results: Without a clear and focused attention to values, gaps can exist and grow between participants and organizers. Conclusion: Of the many ways to conceptualize and act out a social-justice intervention, this research illustrates the potential of explicitly identifying values on the front end of that process and actively designing those values into the organizational aspects of the intervention, to serve as a subtextual glue to keep people working together, undergirded by these value systems, as they collaborate to contribute to a cause.",Subscription only,"Brett Oppegaard, Michael Rabby",Journal,Technical Communication,doi.org/10.55177/tc124312,,Technical Communication,,,"Gamifying good deeds: User experience, agency, and values in play during a Descriptathon and beyond",2022
24361,PR-276851-21,"Gender gets socially constructed in many visual ways, but people who are blind or who have low-vision want to know the gender of those around them, too, as well as other salient positionality details. Like with age, race, fashion, etc., a person's appearance can provide a lot of information about them and their character. Audio description, as a form of audiovisual translation, is a way to make that appearance accessible to those who cannot see it. Yet empirical research about audio description of gender – a complicated and highly contested arena of public discourse – is underdeveloped. This study addresses that issue through a Grounded Theory approach, constructivist in nature, that both generated self-descriptions of portrait images and piloted a model way to analyze them. This process prompted 179 new self-descriptions written during three hackathon-like events over multiple years, illuminating compositional gender-construction strategies as well as fertile paths for audio description research.",,"Brett Oppegaard, Andreas Miguel",Journal,Perspectives,doi.org/10.1080/0907676X.2022.2116990,,Perspectives,,,Audio description of gender: Self-description as an evocation of identity,2022
24362,PR-276851-21,"Introduction: American media-accessibility pioneers in the 1970s and 1980s not only sparked interest in the academic study of audio description, they also originated many practical techniques, protocols, theoretical perspectives, guidelines, and standards that persist in the fabric of this type of work decades later. In this study, we located and analyzed source documents for two oft-mentioned innovators—Gregory Frazier and Margaret Pfanstiehl—to shine light on their individual perspectives through a historiography of their foundational writings and associated media. Method: This analysis was conducted on publicly available source documents, such as Frazier's landmark thesis and also included a trove of Pfanstiehl's personal correspondence, as a way to establish particular points of theoretical and historical interest. Results: We found that despite the prominent place of Frazier and Pfanstiehl in audio description lore, neither actually published much writing about what they did and why they did it. Some of what they wrote has been selectively repeated, but other parts have been forgotten. In that respect, this research method could be used to more precisely trace and identify where particular practices emerged, under which theoretical perspectives, and complications. It also can help to show how these ideas were documented and tested during their emergence and domestication, as a way to gauge procedural rigor as well as validity of related findings. Discussion: Audio description scholarship needs theoretical anchors, but it also needs systematic testing of assumptions inherent in those theoretics, which this study helps to identify. Implications for Practitioners: Audio describers invariably will encounter the moment when an assertion of ""this is the way we do it"" collides with the curiosity of ""why?"" To promote best practices, the field has to understand where practices came from, how they developed, and as Frazier recommended, put those ideas to ""objective"" test",,"Brett Oppegaard, Sajja Koirala",,Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness,doi.org/10.1177/0145482X221116903,,Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness,,,The light bulb went on: A historiography-based approach to disentangling audio description’s influential U.S. roots from its common practices.,2022
24432,FT-260121-18,"Catholic artifacts—images and sculptures of Christ, the Virgin, and various saints, as well as rosaries, crucifixes, and liturgical objects—circulated in their thousands throughout the early modern western Mediterranean. This mobility was largely an indirect byproduct of privateering and human trafficking, which intertwined Spain's Mediterranean territories, Morocco, and Ottoman Algiers. The disruptive moment of captivity set these otherwise disparate objects on common trajectories, making it interesting to study them as a category. The article argues that Catholic artifacts played surprising roles in the experience of Catholic captives, renegades, and their Muslim masters as well as in the economy of ransom that facilitated the rescue of captives. Against the design of their initial distributors, such objects provided captives, converts, and masters with unexpected affordances, and in so doing helped blur the religious boundary and created new entanglements between members of these groups and Catholic materiality. The argument is developed in three stages. First, the article claims that the surge in captivity following the Spanish-Ottoman truce of 1581 meant that more devotional objects were sent from Spain to Catholics held captive in the Maghrib. Second, it asserts that some of these artifacts ended up serving converts to Islam, while others were plundered by Algerian and Moroccan rulers. Third, the article contends that plunder and repurposing afforded captives the power to redeem an emblem of their God, provided Trinitarians and Mercedarians with opportunities to ransom objects and gain fame back home, and served Maghrebi rulers to secure religious privileges for their subjects enslaved in Spain. Focusing on their mobility demonstrates the degree to which Catholic objects continued to articulate and mediate social, political, and economic relations in the western Mediterranean over the long seventeenth century.",,Daniel Hershenzon,Journal,"Histoire, Sciences Sociales 76-2",https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/article/abs/objets-captifs-les-artefacts-catholiques-en-mediterranee-au-debut-de-lepoque-moderne/888A4D92F2F8F1ADF5AD3A7EB58B0322,,,,,“Objets captifs.

The map depicts the majority of Native settlements on the river's north bank, a pattern interpreted as evidence that the Rappahannock communities physically distanced themselves as much as possible from Powhatan political control. Rappahannock tribal oral history, however, holds that the Rappahannock polities and the Powhatans enjoyed a political relationship as equals and neighbors, not as subjects or adversaries. Tribal historical and ecological knowledge, publicly available environmental information, and the distribution of known archaeological sites indicate that desirable factors for settlement—including level sandy loam soils, access to marshes, proximity to navigable waterways, and wide viewsheds—occur more frequently and in closer association with one another on the river's north bank.

Although the cache's precise location is not known, this reconsideration suggests that the cache was probably created by an Indigenous person or persons and replenished at least once and possibly two times. The cache was located at Pissaseck, a town mapped by John Smith in 1608 and, based on artifacts associated with the town, a persistent place in the Indigenous landscape for millennia. Beads similar to those recovered from the cache (and possibly from the same European bead factories) have been recovered throughout the Eastern Woodlands.

I suggest that the materiality of Ravan images creates the possibility of a spectrum of (often unarticulated) Ravan-dominant ideologies/theologies and identities: Ravan's images stand as neighbours, boundary watchmen, or simply part of the landscape, often barely noticed; he is honoured as a Brahmin, a wise man, and a Gond ancestral king; he is integrated into a Gond cosmology unrelated to the Ramayan; and his material presence questions dominant variants of the Ramayan narrative.",open access,Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger,Journal,South Asian History and Culture,,,Taylor &amp; Francis,,,Standing in Cement: Ravana on the Chhattisgarhi Plains,2017

13542,FT-58584-11,"This short text takes up some questions having to do with acts of self-definition, collective authorship, and expression, and how they are rehearsed, examined, and denied—in short, put into motion—by means of musical performance. To improvise is to work with known materials and techniques, moving them in the direction of uncertainty. When you improvise with others, you bring your skills and your musical personality to the encounter. You use them to participate in an exchange, and that exchange issues something new, something that could not be foreseen—and that is open improvisation, at least according to one widespread and common-sense understanding of the practice. But I will explore another variant, one that embarks on its journey toward uncertainty by pulling apart personality and rendering it into a site of ongoing investigation. Both of these understandings of improvisation convert certainty into uncertainty, one by stretching or risking the self in a situation of surprise, and the other by disas- sembling or nullifying the self in order to get free of it. I want to think about these fascinating problems in relation to George E. Lewis's influential pair of descriptive tools, the Afrological and the Eurological. This schema of postwar spontaneity remains useful and productive, I will suggest, when it is reanimated in analytical scenarios that might disrupt the work of disentanglement that it is often called upon to perform. My thinking on the subject of non-self-expressive improvisation has been informed substantially by research on the rock band Henry Cow, whose improvisational practice and interpretations of it will form the main contribution of this text.","open access, peer reviewed","Piekut, Benjamin",Journal,Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies,http://liminalities.net/14-1/enigmas.pdf,Link to PDF of the article.,Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies,,,Another Version of Ourselves: The Enigmas of Improvised Subjectivity,2018

13544,FT-58584-11,"John Cage's brand of experimentalism underwent a transformation when it was imported into the UK in the 1960s. There, in contradiction to the American's well-known preferences, indeterminacy became twisted up with jazz-derived free improvisation, owing to discourse that stressed performer freedom and creativity while downplaying notions of non- intention and discipline. The authors of these commentaries created the discursive conditions for a mingling of avant-garde traditions, but the material conditions owed more to the efforts of Victor Schonfield, whose nonprofit organization, Music Now, acquired Arts Council subsidies on behalf of a stylistically heterogeneous avant-garde that included artists working with both improvisation and indeterminacy. Schonfield also invited important guests from overseas, including Ornette Coleman, Musica Elettronica Viva, the Sonic Arts Union, the Instant Composers Pool, Christian Wolff, Sun Ra, the Taj Mahal Travellers, and, in 1972, John Cage himself. In the greater ecology of experimentalism that Schonfield created, improvisation became a kind of contact zone where musicians came together from a number of directions, among them free jazz, score-based indeterminacy, text-based intuitive music, Fluxus-inspired instruction pieces, and even psychedelic rock freak-outs. Music Now produced over 80 concerts between 1968 and 1976, when the organization folded.","Subscription, peer-reviewed","Piekut, Benjamin",Journal,Journal of the American Musicological Society,http://jams.ucpress.edu/content/67/3/769.article-info,UC Press website,Journal of the American Musicological Society (Univ of Calif.

13570,FB-57615-14,"El milagro de anaquillé (1927), a ballet project with libretto by Alejo Carpentier and music by Amadeo Roldán, originated at the intersection of avant-garde art, afrocubanismo, and ethnography. Inspired by the aesthetic experimentation of Les Ballets Russes and Les Ballets Suédois in Europe, Carpentier and Roldán adopted ballet as a vehicle for introducing avant-garde trends in Cuba. Their work referenced two revolutionary ballets: Rite of Spring and, more importantly, Parade. Seeking to restage an Abakuá ritual, this project illustrated the artistic output of afrocubanismo as well as the movement's ethnographic approach to the study of black culture. The libretto, which depicted the conflict between a US filmmaker and a group of Abakuá celebrants, critiqued the colonialist caricatures of the racial other's dancing body in cinema and ballet. In doing so, it contributed to a concurrent repudiation of colonialist films in Latin American intellectual circles. Amid pivotal changes in cultural anthropology, the libretto also prefigured the practice of ethnographic reflexivity by alluding to the ideological entanglement of anthropology and coloniality. It obliquely represented the lopsided interactions—mediated by class, race, and education—between ethnographers and subjects. To formulate such political messages, Milagro made adept use of caricature, irony, metatheatricality, nonrealist representation, and other techniques from the avant-garde tool kit for critical interrogation of reality.",Subscription,Lester Tome,Journal,Cuban Studies,,,,,,The Racial Other’s Dancing Body in El milagro de anaquillé (1927): Avant-Garde Ballet and Ethnography of Afro-Cuban Performance,2018

Adapting the practice of ballet to this Marxist context, ballet dancers took their art to the working classes through popular performances and outreach events in farms and factories. Given the centrality of manual work to the Revolution's ideology, dancers drew upon their own physical labor both in ballet and agriculture to establish an even stronger association with the working classes and embody the New Man's morality. Known for their strict work ethic, Alicia Alonso and other baller dancers became public examples of hard work for the nation—one way of fulfilling the politico-pedagogical role that the state expected from artists. At the same time, media representations of female dancers' labor enabled formulations of the New Man's gendered counterpart: the New Woman.",Subscription,Lester Tome,Journal,Dance Research Journal,,,,,,Swans in Sugarcane Fields: Proletarian Ballet Dancers and the Cuban Revolution’s Industrious New Man,2017

13583,FA-57922-14,"Antoine Busnoys's Missa L'homme armé commits one notational error after another—at least according to Johannes Tinctoris. As several scathing passages in his Proportionale musices attest, Tinctoris abhors Busnoys's mensural innovations. And yet Busnoys's notational choices, while certainly idiosyncratic, are also arguably justifiable: the composer was merely finding ways of recording novel musical ideas that had no agreed-upon notational solutions. In this article I argue that Tinctoris's response to Busnoys is not limited to the criticisms in his theoretical treatises. Tinctoris the composer responds far more comprehensively, and at times with far greater sympathy for Busnoys's practice, in his own Missa L'homme armé. He echoes Busnoys's mass notationally, in that he treats it as an example of what not to do; his response is also deeply musical, in that he tackles similar technical problems as a means of achieving analogous contrapuntal effects. Tinctoris's and Busnoys's settings need to be understood in the context of fifteenth-century masses, one in which composers were not necessarily content to work within the system but invented new ways of writing in order to create new sounds. In doing so, mere ""composers"" could sometimes achieve significance as ""theorists."" Taken together, the L'homme armé masses of Busnoys and Tinctoris raise a range of historiographical issues that invite us to reassess the figure of the ""theorist-composer."" This article thus not only contributes to the discourse on musical borrowing but also opens out to a broader framework, asking what it means for a late medieval musician to theorize—in music as well as in prose.",,Emily Zazulia,Journal,Journal of the American Musicological Society,http://jams.ucpress.edu/content/71/1/1,,,,,"Composing in Theory: Busnoys, Tinctoris, and the L'homme armé Tradition",2018

The current article summarises limitations of the current literature and introduces The Veterans Metrics Initiative (TVMI) study, a longitudinal assessment of US veterans' well-being and programme use in the first three?years after they separate from military service. Veterans were assessed within 3?months of military separation and will complete five additional assessments at 6-month intervals during the subsequent period.  The TVMI study cohort consists of a national sample of 9566 newly separated US veterans that were recruited in the fall of 2016.  The TVMI sample includes representation from all branches of service, men and women, and officers and enlisted personnel. Although representative of the larger population on many characteristics, differential response rates were observed for some subgroups, necessitating the development of non-response bias weights. Comparisons between unweighed and weighted results suggest that the weighting procedure adequately adjusts for observed differences.  Analyses are under way to examine veterans' well-being and programme use in the period following separation after military service, as well as factors associated with poor outcomes. We have also begun to decompose programmes into their core components to facilitate examination of how these components relate to well-being.

13626,FA-57961-14,"Discussions of corpse contact impurity in biblical, as well as Palestinian and Babylonian rabbinic texts, have shaped scholarly assumptions that ancient Jews generally avoided spaces associated with the dead. While rabbinic writings repeatedly consider suitable responses to death, including procedures for corpse treatment, funerals, and mourning, few ancient texts discuss activities Jews once conducted at graveside to commemorate the dead through time. Even if rabbinic texts do not explicitly document the practice, however, analyses of neglected archaeological data from Levantine and European burial caves, including textual and pictorial graffiti, reveal that some ancient Jews did spend time close to the dead by performing multiple activities of mortuary commemoration around tombs. Hundreds of examples of graffiti discovered in Roman Palestine and in the catacombs of Rome, Malta, and North Africa, this paper suggests, offer rare and tangible evidence, in situ, for how some Jews and their neighbors systematically and diachronically visited and elaborated the interiors of cemeteries after the completion of activities surrounding burial and interment. While excavators and historians commonly use rabbinic texts as frameworks to interpret the contemporaneous archaeological record, this paper thus advocates an opposite approach – the independent and contextual evaluation of artifacts – to facilitate a rereading of ancient rabbinic writings concerning ancient Jewish mortuary practices.",open access,Karen B.

We also replicate our core findings using survey data from a modern municipal election.

Within a larger ensemble of musicians, I focus on Edgar Varèse and Charles Mingus in order to address dilemmas of race and citizenship in downtown New York during a period of postwar American cultural ascendency and national canon formation.

13649,FA-58054-14,"Yoko Ono has increasingly found recognition as a founding mother of 1960s performance and conceptual art movements and a key mediator of transnational avant-gardes.  Yet little scholarship has addressed the earliest works that established her career in New York in 1961.  This lacuna partly arises from the ephemeral nature of those pieces, which confound disciplinary expectations.  While most critical literature on Ono is written from an art historical angle, remarkably few visual traces remain from her early career.  Moreover, Ono's first performances eschewed formal scores and tape recording, discouraging musicological methods of interpretation.  Ono designated her first extended piece ""AOS-for David Tudor"" (1961) as an ""opera.""  Her use of this traditional term may seem surprising given the radical nature of the work, which involved the juxtaposition of animal sounds with human voices, a dehumanizing pile-up of human bodies, primal screaming, and amplified playback of speeches by Hitler and Hirohito.  Blending archival research with a critical reading of Ono's intermedial poetics, this paper follows Ono's lead to consider how ""opera"" clarifies her earliest legacies.  The term speaks to her aspirations as a dramatist accessing a heightened affective register.  It also indicates her desire to ""operate"" in the world.  To appreciate Ono as an ""operatist/operator"" is also to apprehend how strongly her work diverged from the Cagean circles in which she then traveled.  Meant to be spread ""by word of mouth,"" Ono's dramas signaled a critical moment in the politicization of the 60s avant-garde, raising questions that haunt contemporary critical practice.",subscription access,Brigid Cohen,Journal,ASAP/Journal,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/686302,,Johns Hopkins University Press,,,"Ono in Opera: A Politics of Art and Action, 1960-62",2018

Fishing in this region is determined by the annual migrations of the major Black Sea fish species.  These spawn in the shallow waters along the north coast and migrate in highly predictable cycles around the sea.

During this period, medical experts played a much more influential role in the courts; however, those summoned to intervene in child sexual assault cases not only bolstered but also undermined efforts to bring offenders to justice. Many doctors who could not detect physical traces of sexual abuse concluded that the assault had never occurred and that the child's accusation was false. Furthermore, doctors routinely cast moral judgements on those identified as victims of sexual abuse. The understandings of childhood innocence that engendered new efforts to combat child sexual abuse were called into question by the simultaneous rise of medico-legal experts, whose frequent negative findings led many to discount accusations of abuse and to maintain that children, particularly girls and working-class children, were not as innocent as they seemed.",Subscription only,E.

13713,FA-251827-17,"This study explores how Filipino Hansen's disease patients confined to the Culion leper colony engaged with government authorities over food-related issues during the first three decades of the twentieth century. Food rations are understudied themes in the history of the Culion leper colony. Earlier scholarship on Culion focused on the segregation policy, medical practices, and general conditions. Recent work highlighted the theme of resistance evident in the patients' flight from the island, protests against the ban on marriage and cohabitation, and petitions for rights as citizens. A few considered agitations and other actions by patients in response to the food situation.  In this study, I argue that food was a platform upon which colonial authority was contested in a myriad of ways and forms. Patients' reactions were directed not only at poor quality and insufficient quantity of rations, but also at the American colonial state's policy that exiled them to the island of Culion. Many of them practiced self-sufficiency to address basic food needs and to provide financial assistance to the families they left behind. Others actively participated in committees to improve the distribution of rations.  The study of food supply and rations in Culion offers insights into the engagement between Filipino patients of Hansen's disease and colonial administrators. It demonstrates varying forms of patients' resistance and exercise of agency within a restrictive setting and in a colonial context. In some instances, patients' agency was enabled by authorities, thereby complicating the story of their engagement. Consideration of their diverse and multifaceted practices facilitates a fuller understanding of how Filipino Hansen's disease patients dealt with government officials during the American colonial period.

13714,FT-62152-14,"his essay reframes both the woman suffrage narrative and narratives of African American voting rights struggles by focusing on the experiences of southern African American women between the 1870s and the 1920s. It argues that the Fifteenth Amendment remained central to their suffrage strategy long after the failure of the ""New Departure"" to win court sanction caused white suffragists to abandon it. As white supremacists in the South worked at the turn of the century to disfranchise black men, leading African American suffragists such as Mary Church Terrell, Gertrude Bustill Mossell, and Adella Hunt Logan called for the enforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments as well as the enfranchisement of black women. After the federal woman suffrage amendment was ratified in 1920, many southern African American women encountered the same barriers to voting—obstructionist tactics, threats, and violence—that black men had faced a generation earlier. In short, for aspiring African American voters in the South, the failure of the Nineteenth Amendment to secure voting rights for black women constituted a sad sequel to the failure of the Fifteenth Amendment to secure voting rights for black men.  This interpretation offers three significant interventions. It pairs the Reconstruction-era Amendments with the Nineteenth Amendment, recognizing their shared focus on voting rights. It connects the voting rights struggles of southern African Americans across genders and generations. Finally, it finds that, for some women, the canonical ""century of struggle"" for voting rights continued long after the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified.",Subscription,"Gidlow, Liette",Journal,Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,https://doi-org.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/10.1017/S1537781418000051,,,https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/core/journals/journal-of-the-gilded-age-and-progressive-era/article/sequel-the-fifteenth-amendment-the-nineteenth-amendment-and-southern-black-womens-struggle-to-vote/9EDB826096C0353E6FE12E3E345FC5CF,,"The Sequel:  The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nineteenth Amendment, and Southern Black Women's Struggle to Vote",2018

When we do, we can detect how their encounters with the electoral system changed the structure of the political system itself, an insight that challenges the consensus view that woman suffrage simply doubled the electorate without affecting political institutions in any meaningful way. Their stories make it clear that, for many women, the ""century of struggle"" lasted much longer than a hundred years  Furthermore, the entrenchment of the white primary was a direct result of the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment, a development that challenges the consensus view by historians and political scientists that woman suffrage did not change the political process in a significant way.

These issues include inconveniently long wait times, sensitivity to only those pollutants capable of tarnishing metals, a general sense of unreliability, exaggerated environmental conditions, and subjectivity in assessing the test's results. Increasingly, alternative strategies that use instrumental approaches involving volatiles sampling coupled to gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are being explored as faster, more comprehensive, potentially quantitative, and possible more ‘objective' means of assessing the dangers of off-gassing from museum construction materials. While many of these characteristics are now well documented, the objectivity of the instrumental result is arguable. While the detection of volatiles and semi-volatiles by GC–MS can confidently yield a list of potential pollutants, ""chemical intuition"" must be used to predict whether many of the emitted compounds can in fact adversely affect artwork. In this study, evolved gas analysis (EGA) coupled to GC–MS is used to predict the suitability of a small sample set of plastics for use in a museum.

13720,HB-50448-14,"In his 1932 lecture at Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Berlin, Rafael Alberti explores the tendency toward the popular forms prevalent in the Spanish poetry of the 1920s and early 1930s, particularly in the so-named Generation of 1927. As an integral part of Alberti's discussion of popular poetry's reawakening, from modernismo through the Generation of 1927, he considers the romance, Spain's popular poetic form par excellence, placing special emphasis on its modern transformation. The poets of this romance moderno, include, from Alberti's standpoint, Moreno Villa, Jorge Guillén, Pedro Salinas, Federico García Lorca, Fernando Villalón, Luis Cernuda, Vicente Aleixandre, Emilio Prados and Manuel Altolaguirre. While at first glance Alberti's list may seem unremarkable, his exclusion of Gerardo Diego (1896-1987), one of the greatest and most prolific twentieth-century Spanish composers of romances, is striking. Diego differs from his contemporaries Alberti and Lorca in what Juan Larrea calls his ‘heterocronismo,' by which term Larrea gets at the mixing of influences from different moments in literary history that is decisive for Diego's poetic. For Diego's romances draw on diverse literary periods and aesthetic waves: the popular and the culto remaking of the popular (‘poesía de tipo tradicional'); the Romantic and neo-Romantic; modernismo; and the cosmopolitan avant-garde. For Diego weaves into his romances elements inspired by the Romantics Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer and Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin, the modernismo of Rubén Darío and Juan Ramón Jiménez, the exploration of Spanish land and identity in Antonio Machado, and the vanguard movements in poetry Creacionismo and Ultraísmo. Indeed Diego's romances are hybrid by definition, variously blending the Romantic, modernista, and avant-garde with the popular and traditional. This is the true reason for Alberti's striking of Diego from his list of modern romance writers: Diego's ‘punto de arranque' is always somehow other.",,Renée M.

13732,RZ-51748-14,"I explore the politics of memory during the Toledan reforms—a series of ambitious administrative changes legislated in colonial Peru between 1569 and 1581, by viceroy Francisco de Toledo. At the center of Toledo's project was an initiative to resettle the entire native population of the audiencias of Lima and Charcas into a series of planned towns called reducciones. Thismovement—reducción—sought to transform Andean indigenous peoples into subjects of the Catholic Church and the Spanish crown through a series of explicitly spatial operations, including regional population nucleation and settlement planning. But the terms of these changes were also temporal: as reducción shaped landscapes and built environments, it also sought to transform indigenous historicity, bringing native peoples into the Era of Christ and carefully regulating the social institutions and practices by which they accounted for their pasts. The Toledan reforms therefore present a clear example of one empire's attempts to subjugate conquered peoples through mnemonic practices. Yet archaeological research in one corner of the viceroyalty—Peru's Zaña valley—suggests that the story of how indigenous memories were actually shaped during the course of resettlement and its aftermath was far from straightforward. To understand these transformations, I argue that we must explore not only the short-term dialectic of Spanish designs and their indigenous responses, but also the Bafterlives^ of reduccion in the 17th and 18th centuries. Over the longer term, reducción achieved staying power through a series of unanticipated pathways, in which landscape change, demography, and indigenous agency all played essential roles.

Previous scholars have interpreted EGG Ware as the product of indigenous potters who fired ceramics in kilns and learned how to make glazed vessels through direct instruction from Iberian ceramicists. We argue that the production of EGG Ware entailed a more complex process of technological incorporation and innovation. SEM microstructural analysis of 44 archaeological samples suggests that these ceramics were originally fired under highly variable conditions. Parallel analysis of five samples of lead-glazed ceramics produced in open firings by Peruvian artisans in the 1980's reveals consistent firing beyond their clays' maturation temperatures. Based on these results and analysis of whole EGG Ware vessels from museum collections, we suggest that at least some of our EGG Ware samples were produced in open firings.

The corpus of flasks has not been reassessed since the 1970s. Since then, archaeological discoveries have offered important new contextual information about the uses of these souvenir flasks. The flasks visually emphasize monuments still standing in late imperial Puteoli and Baiae that connected the cities to Rome and its emperors. Although we cannot be sure of the agents behind the flasks' design, it is suggested that the cities' civic leaders and glassworks' owners might have collaborated. The article also argues that glass was an ideal material for the Campanian souvenirs, straddling the line between luxury and affordability while also being perceived as characteristic of Puteoli and Baiae. The personal and cultural value of the flasks ultimately derived from a combination of their material , iconography, and status as portable souvenirs, which resulted in a wide range of uses after their purchase, from domestic decorations to votive offerings and grave goods.",Subscription only,Maggie L.

It is based on a frame based content analysis of religious and political themes ofIslam Nusantra. I focus primarily on two films produced by Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) to promote this concept: the near feature length (83 minutes)The Blessing of Islam Nusantara (Oceans of Revelation: Islam as a Blessing for All Creation) and the much shorter (8 minutes) Launching the Film The Blessing Islam Nusantara. The first draws on elements of Sufism, Javanese and to a lesser extent other Indonesian cultures to construct a vision of Islam directly countering that of both violent and non-violent Salafi-Wahhabi extremists. The second promotes the film and Ansor's (the NU youth organization) potential for combatting violent extremism. Theoretically, I rely on insights by Goffman's observations concerning the ways in which semantic frames, and more specifically reframing, can alter dominance hierarchies in discourse systems and Sperber's demonstration that symbolization is a cognitive process that evokes as well as communicates meaning and emotion.",Open Access,"Woodward, Mark R.",Journal,Heritage of Islam Nusantara: International Journal of Religious Literature and Heritage,http://jurnallektur.kemenag.go.id/index.php/heritage/article/view/398,Direct link to article,Center for Research and Development of Religious Literature and Heritage,http://jurnallektur.kemenag.go.id/index.php/heritage/index,Link to journal home page,Islam Nusantara: A Symbolic and Semantic Analyses,2018

13837,RZ-51470-12,"In recent decades, the growing influence of transnational Salafi movements has been a matter of great concern in Indonesia. Salafi movements insist on literal interpretations of Islamic texts and argue that cultural traditions other than those of Saudi Wahhabis are not authentically Muslim. Such claims threaten to disrupt the delicate balance of inter-religious and inter-cultural tolerance on which many Indonesians have come to depend. Salafi movements are also frequently blamed for the recent growth in violent jihadist sensibilities within Indonesia's Muslim population. In response, many Islamic organisations have developed ideologies and symbols with which they might counter Salafist influences. Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Indonesia's largest Islamic organisation, now promotes what it calls ‘Islam of the Archipelago', emphasising traditional Sufi religious teachings and a strong commitment to Javanese culture. By contrast, Muhammadiyah, the nation's second-largest Islamic organisation, places universal human values and global engagement at the heart of its ‘Cosmopolitan Islam'. ‘Islam of the Archipelago' and ‘Cosmopolitan Islam' have attracted much attention in the Indonesian and international press. But As'adiyah members feel that neither vision is quite right for Indonesia's Buginese population, over six million in number.

In Yogyakarta, support for the sultanate was higher than in Surakarta: respondents argued that Yogyakarta had the culture and history required to justify status as a special autonomous region. In Yogyakarta but not Surakarta, monarchism was positively related to national identity and trust in national democratic political institutions. The intersection between local and national representations of history, especially concerning the instrumentality of the local monarchy in giving birth to the nation in Yogyakarta, created historical continuity/positive intersectionality where the superordinate nation and the local monarchy are networked in a system of power and meaning that lends trust in democratic institutions from monarchism, and strengthens national identity.",Subscription,"Isler, Laina, Woodward, Mark R., Hakim, Moh Abdul, Liu, James H.

13855,FA-251630-17,"Sufisms in North Africa are both esoteric and exoteric; that is, they harbour hidden forms of knowledge and experience known only to initiates but perform them regularly in rituals that are public or semi-public, making them accessible to all. When musics of these rituals are brought onto the concert stage, then, they pose analytical challenges to binaries such as spectatorship/ participation, loss/renewal and authenticity/inauthenticity. In Tunisia, the staging of Sufi music has been monopolised for decades by a staged spectacle called el-Hadhra, which, along with its offshoots and competitors, proceeds according to a modular logic of culture in which music, dance, trance and other aspects of ritual are approached as separable, extractable and available for recombination in a plug-and-play manner. This paper unpacks the implications of this logic of modularity through a close reading of el-Hadhra that focuses on strategies of minimising and maximising the ‘contextual gap' between ritual and stage performances. The resulting ambiguities, I argue, encourage multiple and sometimes contradictory readings that nevertheless illuminate the musical and ritual chains of value activated by Sufi performance and draw attention to the shifting social, religious and political functions and meanings of Sufism in the Tunisian public sphere.",Subscription,Richard Jankowsky,Journal,Journal of North African Studies,https://doi.org/10.1080/13629387.2017.1364632,,Journal of North African Studies,,,Absence and 'Presence': El-Hadhra and the Cultural Politics of Staging Sufi Music in Tunisia,2017

These activities enabled individuals and groups within the Ottoman political-military elite, and within the city of Constantinople, to perform their identities and assert their place in the Ottoman social order. The ceremony allows us to discuss the origins and contents of Ottoman ceremonial culture, which borrowed themes and motifs from the Byzantines, the Venetians, and the myriad Turko-Muslim polities with whom the Ottomans maintained intense diplomatic and cultural relations. Next, it highlights the elevation of male circumcision, a fundamental ritual in all Islamic societies, to the status of a major dynastic event that addressed the entire Ottoman polity as well as its competitors in East and West. Finally, it shows how, in early modern societies, public ceremonies served as instruments of governance by creating highly visible, memorable, and relatively participatory events, and by constituting new spaces for political and cultural interactions.",Subscription only,Kaya Sahin,Journal,American Historical Review,https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/123.2.463,,Oxford University Press,,,Staging an Empire: An Ottoman Circumcision Ceremony as Cultural Performance,2018

Demonstrating that the concatenation of forms in the manual operates in the service poetic as well as practical ends, it further argues for seeing the Treatise as an integral part of the Chaucerian corpus rather than as a curious outlier.",Through author's personal Box file or purchase from Cambridge UP.,Lisa H.

Algerian playwrights had been experimenting with the halqa since the 1960s, putting it in dialogue with Brechtian styles of voicing and acting while bringing it to new audiences on a proscenium stage. Istijmam went further, attempting to recreate an embodied experience of halqa via a new mise-en-scène and a form of physical theater inspired by Grotowski. Whereas previous analyses have focused on the discursive organization of a halqa-style play, this essay also considers the halqa in terms of its mise-en-scène and its embodied materiality.

13998,AV-255550-17,"War in the Pacific: Difficult Heritage, a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project of East Carolina University in partnership with the Northern Marianas Humanities Council and the Saipan Historic Preservation Office, engages veterans of contemporary wars, surviving civilian participants of WWII, and families of military service personnel in considering how difficult heritage can be seen as universal to humanity and how it can be used to examine the veteran's experience and even heal and renew. The starting point for this consideration is to focus on the historical and contemporary warrior/veteran's experience as it relates to our collective human experience of war and how we might come to understand and interpret the heritage created through conflicts as shared, collective heritage.   This process is accomplished through the development of a program that train local Saipanese community members with experience and interest in humanities, history and veteran affairs to be discussion leaders who will conduct humanities discussion groups with local, primarily Chamorro and Carolinian, veterans. The wars chosen are the Spanish-Chamorro Wars of the 17th century and the WWII Battle of Saipan as bookends to the history of resistance and aggressions in the islands. Together these wars were chosen because they represent the complexities of all of the participants of war, combatant and non-combatant, in a colonial and post-colonial context.

Such accounts, though, render invisible the role of animals in biomedical research and the relationships formed between human scientists and their animal subjects. In this issue's Gallery essay, Matthew Klingle shows how visual images can complicate and enrich this human-centered narrative. Taking us to the University of Toronto in the early 1920s, Klingle looks at a series of photographs and other images of dogs used in diabetes research. He situates these pictures within the broader environmental context of an urban setting that provided university researchers with a steady supply of strays. Through a wide-ranging analysis of the visual record, Klingle addresses larger questions about the ethical debates over animal experimentation—from the critiques of the antivivisection movement during the early twentieth century to the views of some diabetics and diabetes activists today. His essay offers a model for scholars interested in representations of animals and illuminates the changing, contested meanings of images over time.""",Subscription only with limited open access,Matthew Klingle,Journal,Environmental History,http://academic.oup.com/envhis,,Oxford University Press,,,The Multiple Lives of Marjorie: The Dogs of Toronto and the Co-Discovery of Insulin,2018

14183,FA-57722-14,"In book 7 of his Speculum musicae, the fourteenth-century music the- orist Jacobus structures a defense of music as it had been practiced in the thirteenth century by such eminent musicians and theorists as Lambertus, Franco, and Petrus de Cruce against the practices of certain unnamed moderni active at the time of Jacobus's writing. While Jacobus'squotations from various theoretical works by Jehan des Murs have long been recognized, it previously had been supposed that the remaining quotations were jumbled references from many different theorists. With specific reference to Philippe de Vitry only two quotations from the text edited in vol. 8, Corpus scriptorum de musica, had been identified previously. In fact, there is substantial sustained treatment of a single author,whom I have termed the doctor modernus and who is not Jehan des Murs, that occupies at least five contiguous central chapters of book 7. Following Jacobus's practice in the previous six books of commentary on a handful of specific works, the writing of Book 7 appears to have been structured around the written works of just four theorists: Lambert, Franco, Jehan des Murs, and the doctor modernus. The similarities between the treatise of the doctor modernus and many ars nova theory texts (some of which were attributed to Vitry) hints at the 493 possibility that the treatise of the doctor modernus may have been the ancestor text that these other texts had in common, and hence also that Philippe de Vitry may have been the author of the text known to Jacobus, whose subject was the Ars vetus et nova.",,Karen Desmond,Journal,,,,University of California Press,,,"Did Vitry write an Ars vetus et nova?

14197,HT-251006-16,"This article highlights the importance of books as dynamic actors within the Republic of Letters by means of multi-layered visualizations of epistolary networks. In the past decade, it has become increasingly common to make use of networks to study shifts in early modern scholarly exchange. Originally, almost all of these studies employed a single-layered network where one node of the graph represents a correspondent, and an edge between a pair of nodes corresponds to a letter exchanged between them. However, reducing the complex society of the Republic of Letters to a network in which actors are connected by one single type suggests a static uniformity that barely takes into account the multi-faced dynamics of epistolary exchange. In addition to letters, the Republic of Letters was tied (and untied) together primarily by means of books: they could foster networks when given as gifts, as well as influence and endanger connections if enlisted on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Therefore, this paper intends to discuss an approach that integrates both letters and books in a unified, dynamic multi-layered network representation. To this end, the epistolary network of the Dutch philologist Nicolaas Heinsius (1620-1680) with the Florentine Medici court serves as a case study to illustrate the applicability of multi-layered networks in correspondence research.",Open access,Ingeborg van Vugt,Journal,Journal of Historical Network Research,https://doi.org/10.25517/jhnr.v1i1.7,,Université du Luxembourg,,,Using Multi-Layered Networks to Disclose Books in the Republic of Letters,2017

Most so-called ""Domesday satellites"" survive only in later manuscript compilations which do not preserve evidence of their original material formats and uses. However, two bodies of text do provide such information. The first, known as ""Exeter Domesday,"" is an extraordinary trove of the inquest's raw data digested into 103 individual parchment libelli, probably produced by a team of scribes working at Winchester. The second consists of two texts made at the Benedictine abbey of Burton-upon-Trent in Staffordshire: a fragmentary roll of parchment constituting a working draft survey of the abbey's lands and an endorsed copy of its Anglo-Saxon foundation charter, both of which preserve a list of manors that derived from an intermediary draft of the Domesday *descriptio*. Analysis of these invaluable artifacts makes several contributions to our knowledge of the textual landscape that produced Domesday Book: they are witnesses to the flexible yet exacting mechanisms of data collection that made the royal inquest possible; they shed new light on the near-immediate reception of the inquest's documentation; and they support recent scholarly conjectures that Great Domesday was not the premeditated outcome of the inquest, but a later project, possibly not initiated until sometime after the Conqueror's death. Finally, and most importantly, they show that the king's motives for ordering the inquest, and the uses which he and his advisors may have envisioned for it, are not the only motives and uses that matter.",via subscription,Carol Symes,Journal,Speculum,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699010,This is the publisher's website.

Current research has identified both pedagogically sound applications and important benefits to students. In this paper, we present the results of an initial study which compares the academic benefits of integrating podcasts into the curriculum against using them as a supplemental/review tool. The study's findings indicate that when instructors use podcasts for multiple instructional purposes (e.g., to critique student projects and exams, for student video presentations, for student paired interviews, to complete specific assignments, dictations, in roundtable discussions, or for guest lectures), students are more likely to use this technology and to report academic benefits. While the study is limited by small sample sizes and by some within-group variation in instructional techniques, the study provides initial evidence that podcast technology has the potential to provide greater benefits if it is used more than simply as a tool for reviewing.

The young man's war proved to be a powerful trope, and a myth emerged about the typical trench soldier as handsome, white, and eighteen. In this article, I examine literature about the Great War across several nations – primarily Germany, Great Britain, and France – to demonstrate how and why youth became embedded in the collective memory and representation of the war. I argue, in part, that notions of youth in the early twentieth century allowed participating nations to emphasize innocence and tragedy, claiming the moral high ground in the process. As a result, it is now difficult to accurately depict the First World War soldiers as fathers as well as sons, husbands as well as fiance´s, men with careers as well as boys fresh from school.

14560,FA-252460-17,"Beginning with their first confrontation in 1514, the Ottomans and the dynasties ruling over Iran fought over the borderlands extending from the Persian Gulf to Mount Ararat. However, domination of these regions, where autonomous peoples of different cultures lived and interacted, remained an elusive dream, as the borderland peoples defied the authority of the two powers, and the two powers failed to recognize each other's sovereignty. The transformation of this indeterminate borderland into a clearly defined and increasingly monitored border took almost four centuries. It became an internationally recognized border only after seven decades (1843-1914) of intermittent work by mixed international commissions.  Despite such a tangled history, a well-entrenched tradition of Middle Eastern history suggests that the Iranian-Ottoman frontier was firmly established by the Qasr-i Shirin/Zohab Treaty of 1639; and it is one of the oldest boundaries of the world. The myth of 1639 is powerfully enshrined in the historiographies and nationalisms of the countries sharing this boundary. Questioning this myth in the light of Ottoman-Iranian relations, this paper analyzes different versions of 1639 Treaty that were brought to boundary negotiations and exist in various chronicles and suggests an alternative reading of this foundational myth.",Subscription Only,Sabri Ates,Journal,Iranian Studies,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/cist20,Publishers Website.,Taylor &amp; Francis,,,1639 Treaty of Zohab: Foundational Myth or Foundational Document,2018

Contemporary philosophical theorists of liberty have largely neglected the threat that surplus moral constraints pose to liberty and the importance of proper de-moralization for human emancipation.

14698,RZ-249786-16,"Abstract. For the vast majority of human natural history, moral progress and evolutionary success were inextricably intertwined. According to the received evolutionary account, morality arose and spread in early humans because it enhanced within-group cooperation in a Darwinian competition among groups over scarce and scattered resources. Moral psychology and culture was honed in the Pleistocene for these strategic cooperative functions, and the cost of moralities diverging from this adaptive role was evolutionarily and perhaps normatively prohibitive. During this harsh period of human history, the superiority of one morality over another might well have been gauged by how well it fulfilled these evolutionary functions. Recently, however, the premium of evolutionary success has given way to a truly normative project of human betterment. In this essay, we describe and explain the remarkable decoupling of human morality from its long-standing evolutionary roots, and in so doing expose the limitations of prominent evolutionary accounts of morality and moral progress. We then bring these evolutionary theoretic lessons to bear on the question of ethical pluralism. We show that the standard evolutionary argument for ethical pluralism fails because there is a yawning gap between a morality's validity and its success in solving problems of social living. We go on to offer a richer evolutionary argument for ethical pluralism that appeals to two kinds of evolutionary moral constraints: the developmental dynamic of early plasticity paired with later rigidity in individual moral development, and path-dependency in the evolution of moral systems.",,"Russell Powell, Allen Buchanan","Journal, Other",,,,Oxford University Press,,,Evolving Measures of Moral Success,2019
14699,RZ-249786-16,"Moral reasoning is modulated by emotions and other cognitive biases. How do these covert biasing mechanisms shape perceptions of more fundamental moral categories, such as moral standing and moral status (together, ‘MSS'), out of which specific moral attitudes and behaviors flow? In this paper, we explain the centrality of MSS to human evolution, and examine several evolved biases that distort MSS ascription. These include tendencies to deny moral standing, or to attribute lower moral status, to beings that elicit feelings of disgust or fear, as well as to those that are perceived as less similar, less attractive, less individualized, and less disposed toward reciprocal cooperation. These adaptive mechanisms may have served human groups well in the evolutionary past, but in the modern world they pose an obstacle to moral progress and play a key role in moral regression. We argue that these biases have also influenced philosophical and scientific research on animal minds. Our aim is to develop a richer, biocultural understanding of how conceptions of the moral community evolve.",,"Russell Powell, Allen Buchanan",Journal,,,,Oxford University Press,,,The Moral Community Evolves,2020

Linking Melville's early prose in Typee to his later poetry, especially the Holy Land epic Clarel (1876) and the short poem ""To Ned"" (1888), I analyze a characteristic verbal line that Melville associated with the fissured landscape of the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas, where he spent a month in 1842 after jumping ship: a line of sight composed of ridges and gaps, whose traversal involves a discontinuous progression. The distances and depths that open unexpectedly between adjective and noun or between adjective and verb or across the syntax in Melville's prose and poetry are continually tied to experiences of disorientation and reorientation. By analyzing a verbal strenuousness and sensuousness in Melville's lines that gain force from ideological situation, I seek to contribute to recent efforts to come to terms with the elusive concept of verbal style. Crossing the boundaries of prose and poetry, I respond to Colin Dayan's recent provocation in her essay ""Melville's Creatures"" (2014): ""Let us imagine what prose would look like if it were to become a perspectival phenomenon, a means of seeing otherwise or crosswise.""",purchase only,Samuel Otter,Other,,http://https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/new-melville-studies/88915E2EED39384C7B27E5913B1E2EC0,Cambridge University Press website,Cambridge University Press,,,"""Melville's Style""",2019

Significant discord divided state actors charged with implementing plans to transform into loyal subjects these mobile hunters and foragers, who inhabited a forested expanse separating the colony's primary inland mining district from the Atlantic coast. Actively engaging settlers, soldiers, and agents of the state, the Botocudo contested Portugal's geopolitical strategy of absorbing native domains in order to link the interior with coastal markets. Despite being condemned as cannibals and subjected to military conquest, they managed to curtail the most violent elements of this strategy. The gap between royal policy and exchanges with Indians in the forests exposed the fragility of attempts to subordinate these peoples and seize their lands as the colonial period came to an end.

This article argues a contrary case: that in significant ways Cavalier verse was indebted to continental poetry in one or other of the European vernacular languages, defined by continental culture and recognized by contemporaries for these qualities. I explore poetry writing in relation to the activities of Cavalier poets in Europe before, during and after the British Civil Wars, either as diplomats, other kinds of political agent, soldiers, tutors, exiles, merchants or just as simple travellers. European poets also came to England, and, while firmly preoccupied in their own business, also directly confronted English matters and people, and wrote poetry about their experiences that may be seen as an integral part of English courtly, literary and royalist identity. I draw on two French examples and one Dutch example, all kinds of libertine verse.

The dominant pattern is that the north European encounter is in general not met by northern literary influence in Marvell's writing: features of citation, quotation, allusion and echo are largely to southern European sources: mostly French and Italian, but also Spanish. Marvell's interest in the longer history of lyric is set in the context of the Thirty Years War that seriously inhibited access to valuable ancient manuscripts. The question of the possible influence of some of Marvell's writings, especially his poetry, in seventeenth-century Europe is discussed.

One perspective asserts that demographic and economic conditions play a critical role in conditioning human organizational decision-making.  Another argument suggests that human agency conditioned by innovative thinking outside of demographic and economic pressures is the more fundamental source of change.  The Bridge River site, British Columbia is an optimal locality to explore variable effects of subsistence economy and demography on social change.  Previous research indicates that Malthusian processes played important roles in demographic, socio-economic, and political change.  This paper presents a test of the Malthusian model drawing data on storage capacity and population size from a single long-lived house within the Bridge River village.  Results suggest that household occupants likely experienced two Malthusian periods, persisting through the first but abandoning the house and village during the second.

In this paper, we use the fine-grained record of Housepit 54 from the Bridge River site, interior British Columbia, to evaluate several alternative hypotheses regarding the evolution of persistent material wealth-based inequality.  Results of our analyses indicate that inequality appeared abruptly coincident with a decline in intra-house cooperation associated with population packing and the initiation of periodic subsistence stress.

Our preliminary results support the contention that earth ovens in village contexts were used in more ways, and potentially by a wider array of cooks, than those in upland contexts.

14849,RA-50099-11,"In his poem ‘The Last Hours of Cassiodorus', Peter Porter has the Christian sage ask: ‘After me, what further barbarisms?'. Yet, Cassiodorus himself accepted, even valorized, at least one form of barbarism that had been rejected by earlier rhetoricians: sardismos (sa?d?sµ??), the mixture of multiple languages in close proximity. In its earliest attestation, Quintilian classified it as a type of solecism (Inst. 8.3.59). By contrast, five centuries later Cassiodorus in his Commentary on the Psalms used the term three times to praise the mixture of Greek, Hebrew and Latin in the Latin Psalter. This reversal, from vice to virtue of speech, illustrates some significant changes in attitudes toward language and multilingualism that developed as Christianity reshaped Roman literary culture. For one, Christian preachers, modelling themselves on the plain style of the Gospels, embraced forms of speech that had been regarded as low and stigmatized. In the words of Augustine (In psalm. 36, Serm. 3.6): ‘better you understand us in our barbarism than to have been deserted in our eloquence' (melius in barbarismo nostro uos intelligitis, quam in nostra disertudine uos deserti eritis).1 Secondly, Hebrew now entered the linguistic consciousness of the Roman literary elite as one of the three languages of Scripture. Even if in-depth knowledge remained rare, it was worthy of being mentioned alongside Greek and Latin, just as it had appeared with them in the inscription on Jesus' cross (Luke 23:38, John 19:20). Lastly, linguistic variety itself came to be positively valued since it reflected the diversity of a church coming together out of many peoples. Commenting on the bride's appearance in Psalm 45, both Augustine and Cassiodorus saw the variegated adornment of her robe as a reference to the diversity of Christian languages.",,Adam Gitner,Journal,Classical Quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0009838819000028,,,,,Sardismos: A rhetorical term for bilingual or plurilingual interaction,2019

Thus the relation between people and polity was predicated on liberty, not servitude as commonly supposed of an area still shackled to the Western ideology of Oriental despotism.

Is it possible, scholars wonder, to validate rather than rationalize the idea that mountains, rivers, and trees are social interlocutors as well as arbiters of justice, resource access, and societal well-being? In a twist of monumental irony, previously market-independent Cambodians are facing, in an odious confluence of fear, need, and desire, an ontological turn toward the rationalized notion that trees, mountains, rivers and all their inhabitants are important primarily as commodities that can be converted to money. This paper explores part of that nexus of fear, need, and desire through accounts of social relationships with the ""owner of the water and the land,"" whose permission is sought for territorial access and resource use. Successful navigation of relationships with the original owner of the territory require respect, solidarity, conservation, and offerings of gratitude. In return people enjoy resource abundance, ritual/technical knowledge, and good health. Improper comportment results in illness, loss of access to forest and water resources, and knowledge loss. In yet another ironic twist, the Development State (defined within) promises poverty alleviation, education, and health care for all those who master the extractive market economy. The paper explores how different ontologies give rise to particular social, political, and economic possibilities, and demonstrates that the punishments of the Original owner of the water and the land are visited upon those who either will not or cannot successfully navigate the extractive market system.",subscription only,Courtney Work,"Journal, Other",Journal of Religion and Violence,https://www.pdcnet.org/jrv/content/jrv 2018 0999 5 14 51,,Philosophy Documentation Center,,,"“There Was So Much”: Violence, Sovereignty, and States of Extraction in Cambodia",2018

This article tackles the question of why two U.S. states that share much in common –a border with each other and with Mexico, nearly identical geography and historical birth as members of the U.S., and large Latino and immigrant populations – diverged in the worlds they created for diverse ethnic and racial groups including immigrants.We develop an analytic narrative that shows how three crucial dynamics fueled the development of two rival racial regimes in the American Southwest: federal relations, group power, and distinct claims of national belonging.",,"Daniel Tichenor, Robin Jacobson",Journal,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,,,,,,"“Contingent Belonging: Diversity, Power, and Identity in the U.S. Southwest""",2019

14986,RA-259260-18,"Through comparison of three poetic texts describing the career of Rana Raj Singh of Mewar (r. 1652–1680), this paper demonstrates how representations of Aurangzeb could vary dramatically even when they were produced for the same Rajput court. Much of the paper focuses on Raj-vilas, a vernacular-language work with a lengthy account of conflict between Aurangzeb and the Rajput lords of Marwar and Mewar. Raj-vilas is also noteworthy for its negative portrayal of the Mughal emperor, whom it castigates as a wicked killer of kin who was duplicitous and vengeful. Sometimes thought to be modern constructions, the criticisms of Aurangzeb found in Raj-vilas reveal that certain ideas about Indian historical figures have continued to be deployed and repurposed over the centuries. Yet Rajput views during Aurangzeb's lifetime were not uniformly unfavourable, as the Sanskrit texts Raja-ratnakara and Raja-prasasti attest. Although these two works resembled Raj-vilas in covering the reign of Rana Raj Singh and were written at roughly the same time, they cast Aurangzeb in a considerably more positive light. This difference can be attributed to the fluctuating political relationship between the Mughal empire and the Mewar kingdom in the decade between 1677 and 1687, underscoring the need to carefully identify the historical contexts within which representations of Aurangzeb were produced and circulated.",Subscription,"Talbot, Cyntha",Journal,Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-royal-asiatic-society/article/poetic-record-of-the-rajput-rebellion-c-1680/36EE4BDBCF53E09D5E5D75D18EE98BB8,Article on journal website,Cambridge University Press,,,"A Poetic Record of the Rajput Rebellion, c. 1680",2018

This article explores how posthuman assumptions embedded in such scripts render the socially embodied human invisible and analyzes cases of their rationalization and enactment within China. The article concludes that understandings of creativity in Chinese urban aesthetics expose premises of globally promoted urban policy scripts more transparently than those informed by European aesthetic traditions. The Chinese city is understood to manifest the creative obsessions of humans rather than to actualize a transcendent, idealized vision separate from that of its human creators. This resembles Guy Debord's idea that what we see in the world—how the world is architected—is a materialization of triumphant ideologies. The contemporary Chinese city, incentivized by the entrepreneurial state, makes visible Debord's globally dominant ""integrated spectacular."" Once creativity and intelligence are rationalized, the autonomous ""creative,"" ""smart,"" ""eco"" city is branded in a global supply chain of city production.

This geographic expedition, led initially by Agustin Codazzi and Manuel Ancizar, explored and mapped the country from 1850 to 1859. For the commissioners and their associates among the creole elite, the history of past epochs was 'written' on the mountainsides for scientific travelers such as themselves to 'read.' They portrayed disparate historical and prehistoric events as overlapping and interrelated. The commission's texts and images linked a catastrophic interpretation of geologic origins to historia patria (patriotic history). The commissioners merged the wars of conquest and independence into a two-act drama enacted on a singular territorial stage. Their reading of geologic, archaeological, and historical evidence endowed the impoverished young Republic of New Granada with a grandiose territory, a great precursor civilization, and a legacy of patriotic resistance to imperialism. Their interpretations, however, would prove controversial.

Across a large expanse of the central Andes a vast number of lower elevation settlements were abandoned and local populations were concentrated in newly constructed, defensibly positioned sites, located along high ridges. In this article we examine this dramatic settlement shift in relation to the Chanka ethnic group that occupied the Andahuaylas region (Department of Apurimac, Peru). The results indicate that the shift from valley to hilltop settlements in the Andahuaylas region occurred around A.D. 1000. We propose that the shift reflects an increased dependency on agro-pastoralism that resulted from a period of climate change.

724,FA-52436-06,"By exploring the relations between Morocco and Spain, Tahar Ben Jelloun's novel Partir provides a critical stance on migration and intercultural exchanges between Africa and Europe that transcends a unilateral indictment of European community-building policies and at the same time refrains from a heroization of the migrant plight as much as from the paternalizing approach it often disguises.  &#x0D; Through what it defines as the ""migrant bovarysm"" in Partir, this article discusses Ben Jelloun's ambivalent position on issues of exile and hospitality between Africa and Europe highlighting the joint (albeit different) responsibilities of the two continents. The idealizations and prejudices emerging from both Mediterranean shores confine the novel's would-be Europeans to a liminal, spectral condition that ultimately alienates them from their homeland as much as from their destination culture. Partir hence questions ethnic policies on a global scale and the liberating prospect of cultural hybridity as creolization beyond borders, by depicting the Mediterranean at once as threshold and bulwark between cultures.&#x0D; ",,Nicoletta Pireddu,Journal,Research in African Literatures,http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/research in african literatures/,,Indiana University Press,,,"“A Moroccan Tale of an Outlandish Europe: Ben Jelloun’s Departures for a Double Exile” ",2009

656,FB-38819-03,"It has long been debated whether it is possible to distinguish between secular and religious elements in 'Hindu law'. At present, the general view is that law cannot be separated from religion in the Indic context, not least because, according to the Shastras, Veda is the chief source of Dharma. Nevertheless, it is recognized that the Dharmashastra incorporates diverse elements: (a) explicitly stated norms of two types: (1) rules derived from priestly ritual codes, and (2) precepts drawn from the Arthashastra (political science) tradition; as well as (b) recognition of the authority of customs specific to region, caste, or profession. Although all these are subsumed within the Brahmanical system, we can discern different conceptions of the relative authority of brahmins and the ruler. This distinction of overlapping spheres of authority is reflected in the treatment of misconduct: the same act may entail punishment by the king as well as distant but automatic consequences due to the operation of karma, consequences that can be averted only by expiatory ritual performances. The ritual impurity of a sin also can have social consequences such as stigma or ostracism, which is likewise removed though expiation. Despite the interlinking of these spheres, their fundamental distinctness is acknowledged in the legal process prescribed in the codes as well as in the glimpses we have of actual legal practice in pre-modern India. Although the Dharmashastra overall represents a system of natural law based on the Brahmanical religious cosmology, it contains within it elements derived from a seemingly positive legal system based on the supreme authority of the king in settling disputes. Further, the distinction between brahmin and royal authority corresponds to a distinction, not between religion and law, but between two parallel and complementary legal subsystems, each with its own set of standards, procedures, and sanctions.",,Timothy Lubin,Journal,"Indologica Taurinensia, vol. 33, pp. 93-122.",,,Torino: Edizioni A.L.T.,,,“Punishment and Expiation: Overlapping Domains in Brahmanical Law”,2007

Most recently, the 2006 Amsterdam exhibition, Rembrandt Caravaggio, indicated both the very keen parallel interests by the two artists, and at the same time, the need for more investigation into how Rembrandt and other Dutch painters, especially Lastman,  regarded Caravaggio's work. Although it has long been noted that Rembrandt's chiaroscuro may owe much to the illumination of Caravaggio, scholars have been reluctant to pursue Rembrandt's interest in the caravaggesque in other ways.

768,FT-54724-07,"The Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, the oldest extant synagogue building in the United States, has provoked a certain amount of controversy regarding its origins: while the architect is known, scholars have disputed whether the essential attributes of the structure should be traced to eighteenth-century English pattern books, descriptions of the Portuguese Synagogue in Amsterdam provided to architect Peter Harrison by congregants, or the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London. The origins of the structure are important, as most of the Portuguese synagogues in colonial American and the Caribbean bear the same basic and unusual design features as the Touro structure. This essay argues that the resolution to this controversy lies in the structural ideal behind both the pattern books and the synagogues in Amsterdam and London: the Biblical Tabernacle and Temple as described by Rabbi Jacob Judah Leon de Templo in his messianic study, the Retrato del Templo de Selomo (1642). Early modern synagogue architects mimicked both the proportions prescribed by Leon de Templo and key symbolic design features of the Temple.

For my analysis I draw upon recent excavations of ritual baths in Amsterdam, Recife, Barbados, Curaçao and St. Eustatius as well as still-standing colonial mikvaot in Suriname. I place a structural reading of these baths within the vision of redemption proposed by Amsterdam Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel, and the idealized discourse about purity laws and ritual baths in the popular eighteenth-century Sephardic biblical commentary, Me'am Loez.",,Laura Arnold Leibman,Journal,Religion in the Age of Enlightenment,http://www.amspressinc.com/rae.html,Journal Website,"AMS Press, Inc.",,,Early American Mikvaot: Ritual Baths as the Hope of Israel,2009

Our study compares the island's Jewish (Spanish-Portuguese), Protestant (primarily Dutch), and Catholic (Afro-Curaçaoan) cemeteries. Following the work of Dickran and Ann Tashijian, Keith Cunningham, Lynn Gosnell, Suzanna Gott and others, we interpret these stones within the religio-cultural context of the people who used them. We argue that whereas ethnic cemeteries in the United States often emphasize the distinctiveness of the communities, Curaçao's cemeteries emphasize both ethnic distinction and ethnic elision. The permeability of racial and religious boundaries in the cemeteries reflects the island's complicated racial history and is an important reminder of how race is often constructed differently outside of the United States. This permeability should not be confused with social equality: indeed, as racial categories became more fluid following emancipation, islanders used other categories such as wealth and status displays to reinforce social privilege within (as opposed to between) ethnic groups.",,"Kent Coupé, Laura Arnold Leibman",Journal,Markers: Annual Journal of the Association for Gravestone Studies,http://www.gravestonestudies.org/publications.htm#Markers,Association of Gravestone Studies Website,Association for Gravestone Studies,,,Cities of the Dead: Architectural Motifs and Burial Practices in Curaçao’s Religious and Ethnic Communities,2011
786,FB-38699-03,"Europeans not only traveled extensively in the early modern period, they also wrote prolifically about their voyages on the familiar Grand Tour circuit to Italy, France and Germany as well as about excursions to more distant locations in Asia. While the more arduous overland and sea journeys to Asia remained the preserve of a more limited number of businessmen, adventurers and government officials in these two centuries, numerous travelogues describing Japan and, increasingly, India, also appeared on publisher's lists throughout Western Europe.    This paper argues that in this period, the convergence emerged not from increasing familiarity with distant countries, but from a conscious effort to find, or coax, the strange from the familiar.  Examining over four dozen accounts written by elite and professional Britons, Frenchmen, Italians, Swedes and Germans who traveled to India, Japan, France and Italy between 1600 and 1800, what becomes clear is that the purpose of travel accounts describing these different regions influenced the author's relationship with cartography more than the existence of geographic information.    Such analysis undermines Henry Ashwood's poetic distinction between geographers and travelers inserted at the front of Edward Terry's seventeenth century voyages to India, that ""Geographers present before men's eyes/How every Land seated and bounded lies/But the Historian and wise Traveller, Decry what mindes and manners sojourn there.""

Each wove transcriptions of archival documents into historical narrative, and pursued a novel approach to history writing in which the medieval liturgy was deeply imbricated.

In this paper, I situate  the tomb-slabs within the context of anti-Salian partisanship and monastic reform.  I discuss the Quedlinburg effigies' iconography, which, in contrast to other epigraphic, numismatic, and sigillographic evidence from St. Servatius, fails to characterize the deceased with unequivocal markers of secular or religious status.  Only a seal implemented by Abbess Gerburg of Cappenberg (r. 1126-1137) resembles the effigies, and a similar figure appears on a tomb-slab from St. Mary's Uberwasser near Munster, where Gerburg previously served as abbess.  All evidence suggests, furthermore, that Gerburg's sympathies lay with aristocratic resistance to Salian rule and with the forces of monastic reform, concepts inherent in the early history of the effigy.  I conclude that the triple tomb monument principally represents Gerburg's interpretation of Quedlinburg's conventual identity in conformity with the post-Salian, reform-oriented spirit she herself embodied.",,Karen Blough,Journal,Gesta,,,International Center of Medieval Art,,,The Abbatial Effigies at Quedlinburg:  A Convent's Identity Reconfigured,2008

They were part of a series of additions made to the Durham Collectar or Ritual (Durham, Cathedral Library A.IV.19) around 970 by the Chester-le-Street scriptorium of St. Cuthbert's community, under the direction of Aldred, the eccentric glossator of the Lindisfarne Gospels.  These five Latin prayers glossed in Old English use exorcistic and benedictional formulas, invoke the assistance of an Archangel Panchiel, and contain atypical references to the Book of Tobit, among other unusual characteristics.  This seemingly heterodox material has received scant attention from scholars assessing the Durham Ritual manuscript and the work of Aldred.  These prayers, however, may reflect the particular interests of the cult of St. Cuthbert, as well as Irish influences in Northumbrian religious practice.  Also, a comparable example of one prayer appears in a contemporary Mainz text related to the early development of the Romano-Germanic Pontifical, suggesting that these prayers were part of a larger process, often invisible, of liturgical experimentation during a period of reform and regularization.",,Karen Louise Jolly,Journal,Traditio 61: 95-147,http://www.jstor.org/pss/27832056,JSTOR,,,,Prayers from the Field: Practical Protection and Demonic Defense in Anglo-Saxon England,2006

1049,FA-54049-08,"One path to cultural innovation in artistic and literary fields is differentiation of a genre into new subgenres. But what are the dynamics at work in such a process? This article addresses that question by identifying and explaining the emergence and trajectory of a new fiction subgenre—the American labor problem novel—during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. I make a theoretical case for the intersection of social movement fields and cultural production fields showing, through a historical sociological analysis, that this subgenre was the joint product of: (1) a shift in literary aesthetic practice resulting from the rise of realism, (2) the subgenre's dialogical character, (3) collective contention surrounding the rise of labor movement militancy, and (4) the exigencies of literary and popular culture markets. The historical conjuncture of these processes contributed to a repository of cultural constructions of class in storied form, as novelists sought to both entertain and educate readers about the emerging realities of class-contentious industrial society. This study demonstrates the fruitfulness of merging sociology of culture theory and social movement outcome perspectives when analyzing cultural change.

1051,FA-54049-08,"This study extends research on varieties of social movement media by focusing on the use of literature,  realist fiction.  During the late 19th-century labor movement activists/sympathizers as well as movement antagonists deployed the novel—namely, the labor problem novel (LPN)—as a cultural form through which the labor problem (as then known) could be characterized both from reform and repression points of view.  I do a close reading of an early ""dialogical cluster"" of LPNs to address three key questions: (1) Form selection—What was it about the realist novel that attracted movement (countermovement) activists/sympathizers to use it?  (2) Field position of authors—What was the position of these LPN authors in relation to the movement field and the literary field?  And (3) Internal structure and content—How did authors shape the internal structure and content of their stories?  As intentional literary activists, authors pivoted between the movement field and literary field selecting the novel for the special powers that it possessed relative to other historically available media.  In general, they produced stories with a direct good/evil binary that was attached to characters who stood for emerging social (class, gender, ethnic) categories in young industrial America.  At least during the Gilded Age, the novel played an important role as medium for characterizing collective actors, dramatizing forms of action, and providing materials for claims of injustice or threats, solutions to social problems, and new social categories and collective identities, all with powerful emotional appeal and entertainment value within the context of massive social change.  As such, the LPN literary formation was an important medium through which the struggle over cultural supremacy could be waged.",,Larry Isaac,Journal,"Research in Social Movements, Conflicts, and Change",,,Emerald Group Publishing,,,Literary Activists and Battling Books: The Labor Problem Novel as Contentious Movement Medium,2012

It argues that the passage of time led the two poets to rewrite their past in very different ways, such that poetic exchanges in which they once ""matched"" (?) each others' sentiments evolved into a debate about the meaning of their shared experiences. Bai Juyi's relatively prosperous and tranquil exile in Jiangnan led him to see both past and present circumstances with greater equanimity, while Yuan Zhen's exile in Sichuan, where he came close to dying of malaria, made him far more bitter about lost opportunities and despondent about the future.

Drawing on the faunal assemblage from Kharaneh IV, an Early/Middle Epipalaeolithic aggregation site in eastern Jordan, this study demonstrates that a combination of taphonomic and contextual analyses alongside ethnographic information may indeed lead archaeologists to insights not directly available from the archaeological record.

Given the country's geography and the long history of human occupation, Greek field archaeology is intense and ongoing, with both rescue and systematic excavations. Human burials are thus frequently encountered in excavations throughout Greece, resulting in the accumulation of osteological material. Some of the common challenges of bioarchaeological research in Greece consist of insufficient time, funding, and documentation in the field; unmet conservation needs and lack of storage space; as well as the long time-gap between excavation and analysis.

The project seeks both to augment the study of literary history by drawing attention to the magnitude of poetry published in newspapers and by making the poetry more readily available for study, as well as to advance work on the use of digital images in facilitating discovery in digital libraries and other digitized collections. We have recently completed the process of training our classifier for identifying poetic content, and as we prepare to move to the deployment stage, we are making available our methods for classification and testing in order to promote further research and discussion. The precision and recall values achieved during the training (90.58%; 79.4%) and testing (74.92%; 61.84%) stages are encouraging. In addition to discussing why such an approach is needed and relevant and situating our project alongside related work, this paper analyzes preliminary results, which support the feasibility and viability of our approach to detecting poetic content in historic newspaper collections.","Open Access, but Journal has ceased publication as of 2017.","Elizabeth Lorang, Leen-Kiat Soh, Maanas Varma Datla, Spencer Kulwicki",Journal,D-Lib Magazine,http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july15/lorang/07lorang.html,,,,,Developing an Image-Based Classifier for Detecting Poetic Content in Historic Newspaper Collections,2015

The construction process was a place-making effort designed to implant order on the urban landscape that involved the displacement of a community who represented everything that city planners sought to erase from Detroit's city center: overcrowding, poverty, immigrants, and transient populations. Current historical archaeological research reveals how the existing ornamental landscape of Roosevelt Park masks the history of a forgotten working-class neighborhood. This synthesis of archival and material evidence details the conditions of life within the neighborhood and of a contentious, decade-long displacement struggle rooted in the inequalities of early-20th-century industrial capitalism. Positioned at the start of a century of controversial urban planning initiatives, the Roosevelt Park case study encourages understandings of displacement as a process that has diachronic and comparative dimensions, both in Detroit and in other urban settings.",Subscription,Krysta Ryzewski,Journal,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1469605315601907,,SAGE Journals,,,"No Home for the “Ordinary Gamut”: A Historical Archaeology of Community Displacement and the Creation of Detroit, City Beautiful",2015

15363,HD-51421-11,"In response to the latest ""crisis"" in the humanities, advocates have marched, rallied, fundraised, and—especially—argued. This essay contends that communication scholars can support the growing ""case for the humanities"" by analyzing argumentative strategies, and more specifically, by offering ethical argumentative strategies that avoid replicating structures of domination. In particular, we look to Mari Lee Mifsud's theorization of rhetoric as gift, which follows Henry W. Johnstone in conceptualizing argument as something other than winning over an adversary. We place Mifsud's theorization of the gift in conversation with the methods of the digital public humanities (DPH), which acknowledge and offer abundant resources for meaning-making. Through the methods of DPH, we offer a response to the humanities ""crisis"" that activates the humanities' already broad constituencies by giving resources for humanistic inquiry rather than seeking to capture adversaries. Our case study is Photogrammar, a DPH project for organizing, searching, and visualizing the New Deal and World War II era photographs funded by the U.S. federal government. The project forefronts visual, nonlinear, and interactive argumentation in order to engage publics in generative humanistic inquiry.

Born in 1865 in Bombay, where his father taught at an arts school, and then exiled as a boy to England, he returned to India as a teen-ager, and quickly established himself as the great chronicler of the Anglo-Indian experience. He was Britain's first Nobel laureate in literature, and probably the most widely read writer since Tennyson. People knew his poems by heart, read his stories to their children. The Queen wanted to knight him. But in recent years Kipling's reputation has taken such a beating that it's a wonder any sensible critic would want to go near him now. Kipling has been variously labelled a colonialist, a jingoist, a racist, an anti-Semite, a misogynist, a right-wing imperialist warmonger; and—though some scholars have argued that his views were more complicated than he is given credit for—to some degree he really was all those things.

15494,FT-60454-13,"Following the conquest of Algiers and its surrounding territory by the French army in 1830, officers noted an abundance of standing stones in this region of North Africa. Although they attracted considerably less attention among their cohort than more familiar Roman monuments like triumphal arches and bridges, these prehistoric remains were similar to formations found in Brittany and other parts of France. However, the first effort to document these remains occurred in 1863, when Laurent-Charles Féraud, a French army interpreter, recorded thousands of dolmens and stone formations southwest of Constantine. Alleging that these constructions were Gallic, Féraud hypothesized the close affinity of the French, who claimed descent from the ancient Gauls, with the early inhabitants of North Africa. After Féraud's claims met with skepticism among many prehistorians, French scholars argued that these remains were constructed by the ancestors of the Berbers (Kabyles in contemporary parlance), whom they hypothesized had been dominated by a blond race of European origin. Using craniometric statistics of human remains found in the vicinity of the standing stones to propose a genealogy of the Kabyles, French administrators in Algeria thereafter suggested that their mixed origins allowed them to adapt more easily than the Arab population to French colonial governance.

The problems created by the scantiness of the evidence are compounded by our own methodological pitfalls, especially the ambiguity of the term ""continuity."" The Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis is a controversial case of a major Greek sanctuary for which a Mycenaean ancestry has been claimed but seriously debated. In this article, the architectural, stratigraphic, and ceramic evidence related to the Mycenaean Megaron B is analyzed on the basis of the unpublished finds and excavation notebooks. The analysis shows that religious rituals took place in Megaron B starting in Late Helladic IIB/IIIA1; that although the settlement of Eleusis shrank after the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces, it continued to be inhabited; and that the Megaron B complex was still standing and plausibly in use when the cult of Demeter was introduced in the eighth century B.C.E. It is further argued that this complex functioned as a lieu de mémoire, a landmark that allowed the inhabitants of Eleusis to preserve the memory of the earlier sanctity of the site, and that it became the defining factor for the choice of location for the later cult of Demeter.

15516,HG-229283-15,"BACKGROUND: The Russian influenza, which began in late 1889, has long been recognized as a major global epidemic yet available statistical evidence for morbidity and mortality has not been fully examined using historical and epidemiological tools. This study of cases and deaths in Indiana during the extended time period associated with the Russian influenza is the first scholarly effort to determine the number of victims from this influenza outbreak across a broad regional case study in the US.  METHODS: The sources for this study include historical records from the US Census, Annual Reports from the Indiana State Board of Health, and death notices published in newspapers. The available evidence is analyzed using historical and epidemiological methods to determine the consistency of reporting categories, the accuracy of death records, and the applicability of contemporary categories for measuring mortality.  RESULTS: In the 3 years during and following the outbreak of ""Russian influenza"" in January 1890 in the state of Indiana, approximately 3200 died specifically of this disease while a total of 11 700 died of influenza and other respiratory diseases. These results confirm that extremely widespread influenza contributed to higher than normal death rates by causing additional deaths in related categories, especially pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.

In this context, the question of whether ""influenza is the forerunner of cholera"" was prompted by a single statement by Russian physician Nikolai Fedorovich Zdekauer, made during a scholarly meeting in St. Petersburg yet quickly disseminated globally through newspapers and medical journals. Tracing the reporting on Zdekauer's statement reveals how quickly misinformation could be transmitted on a global scale at a time of heightened concern about the threat of widespread disease. Yet these same sources, including newspapers and medical journals, also demonstrate how quickly both the leading authorities in medical science and publications aimed at public audiences questioned these reports and presented authoritative alternatives based on reasoned analysis.

In this same period, many medical journals published editorials commenting on the spread of the disease, the likely course of further development and the means for preventing or treating outbreaks. This paper examines comments by local doctors published in the Detroit Free Press and one editorial published in Medical Age, a semi-monthly journal also published in Detroit, as a way to introduce a broader research project engaged in three innovative methods that link the digital humanities and medical history: comparing medical reporting in daily newspapers and medical journals to explore connections across local, regional, national and international levels; combining traditional historical methods of close reading with new tools available for large-scale textual analysis; and developing methods that engage undergraduate students as research collaborators at every stage of the process.",Open access,"Ewing, E.

The devices that made this work possible had been developed in Minneapolis in 1955 and commercialized by 1957. However, restrictions on currency exchange and foreign imports made it difficult for surgeons in India to acquire this new technology. The two surgeons, Kersi Dastur and PK Sen, pursued different strategies to acquire the ideas, equipment, and tacit knowledge needed to make open-heart surgery work. While Dastur tapped Parsi networks that linked him to local manufacturing expertise, Sen took advantage of opportunities offered by the Rockefeller Foundation to access international training and medical device companies. Each experienced steep learning curves as they pursued the know-how needed to use the machines successfully in dogs and then patients. The establishment of open-heart surgery in India required the investment of substantial labor and resources. Specific local, national, and transnational interests motivated the efforts. Heart-lung machines, for instance, took on new meanings amid the nationalist politics of independent India: Even as surgeons sought imported machines, they and their allies assigned considerable value to ‘indigenous' innovation. The confluence of the many interests that made Sen and Dastur's work possible facilitated the uneasy co-existence of conflicting judgments about the success or failure of this medical innovation.",Subscription,Jones and Sivaramakrishnan,Journal,"Social Studies of Science, 8/2018, ISSN: 0306-3127, Volume 48, Issue 4, p. 507",,https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0306312718794034?utm source=summon&amp;utm medium=discovery-provider,Sage Journals,,,"“Making heart-lung machines work in India: Imports, indigenous innovation and the challenge of replicating cardiac surgery in Bombay, 1952-1962,”",2018

Even though the patient survived just three hours, the feat won Sen worldwide acclaim. The ability of Sen's team to join the ranks of the world's surgical pioneers raises interesting questions. How was Sen able to transplant so quickly? He had to train a team of collaborators, import or reverse engineer technologies and techniques that had been developed largely in the United States, and begin conversations with Indian political authorities about the contested concept of brain death. The effort that this required raises questions of why. Sen, who worked at a city hospital in Bombay that could not provide basic care for all its citizens, sought a technology that epitomized high-risk high-cost, health care. To accomplish his feat, Sen navigated Cold War tensions and opportunities, situating his interests into those of his hospital, municipal authorities, Indian nationalism, Soviet and American authorities, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others. The many contexts and interests that made Sen's work possible created opportunities for many different judgments about the success or failure of medical innovation.",,"David S.

15579,RZ-51493-12,"or a long time, the emergence of Aegean states was explained in terms of general evolutionist models based on evidence from a handful of major palatial sites. Recently, however, a growing emphasis on regional diversity has demonstrated the importance of specific models for understanding the multiple pathways to social complexity. It is becoming increasingly clear that static neoevolutionary types do not reflect the fluid and dynamic character of human societies and that top-down explanatory models based on top-tier centers are biased and incomplete. In this article, a detailed historical modeling of the Mycenaean state of Pylos based on new data from the systematic excavation of Iklaina tests the current model and proposes that the Pylian state, as it is known to us from Linear B tablets, was not integrated until an advanced phase of the Late Helladic IIIB period. This analysis suggests that for most of the Mycenaean period both Iklaina and Ano Englianos were primary centers following parallel trajectories and functioning as capitals of independent micropolities. A late date for the unification of the Pylian state could account for its partly decentralized character, the duplication of administrative structures, and the instability that may have contributed to its collapse.",Open Access,"Cosmopoulos, M.B.",Journal,American Journal of Archaeology,https://www.ajaonline.org/article/3919,AJA,American Journal of Archaeology,,,State Formation in Greece: Iklaina and the Unification of Mycenaean Pylos,2019
15580,RZ-51493-12,"Although the ceramic phases and relative chronology of the Mycenaean (or ""Late Helladic"" abbr. LH) period on the Greek mainland are well established, there is ongoing disagreement regarding the relationship between the ceramic phases and their associated calendar dates. Part of the problem is the small number of radiocarbon dates from Mycenaean sites. In this article, we publish a set of 15 new AMS radiocarbon dates from the Mycenaean site of Iklaina, in southwestern Greece. The resulting date ranges allow us to establish an absolute chronology for major stages in the life of the Iklaina settlement and the associated relative chronology based on ceramic phases. In general, the Iklaina dates show a better fit with the High Chronology for the early Mycenaean period. Specifically, the transition from the Middle to Late Helladic, at the beginning of the Mycenaean period, is placed between the end of the 19th c. and the beginning of the 17th c. BC. The LH II period, when large-scale architecture appears at Iklaina for the first time, spans the 17th century BC and the LH IIIA1 period goes into the 15th century. None of the analyzed samples were recovered from secure LH IIIA2 deposits, so they do not affect the chronology of this period. However, the samples from the destruction of the monumental buildings, which ceramically is placed in the LH IIIB period, provide a general latest use date in the 13th century. Given the possibility that this destruction marks the annexation of Iklaina by the Palace of Nestor and the unification of the Pylian state, this becomes an important chronological marker for the formation of this state. It also indicates a very short life-span for this state, since its destruction is traditionally dated to ca. 1200?BCE.",Open Access,"Cosmopoulos, M.B., Allen, S.E., Riebe, D., Ruscillo, D., Liston, M., Shelton, C.",Journal,Journal of Archaeological Science-Reports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18307624,,Journal of Archaeological Science-Reports,,,New accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates from the Mycenaean site of Iklaina,2019

These replicas will be exhibited alongside the originals in the new Pylos Archaeological Museum. Due to the high archaeological value of the objects, the analytical approach we followed was completely non-destructive and was based on the parallel use of optical microscopy, p-XRF and SEM/EDS. The analyses suggest the use of Egyptian blue pigment for the backgrounds. The wavy black coil of hair was painted with an organic black pigment. The use of inorganic pigments has been revealed on the upper layers on the basis of the identification of minerals and rocks.

Yet faced with the limited effectiveness of informational approaches to cessation, antitobacco campaigns featured fear in the 1960s. These provoked little protest outside the tobacco industry. At the outset of the AIDS epidemic, fear was also employed. However, activists denounced these messages as stigmatizing, halting use of fear for HIV/AIDS until the 21st century.

We argue that the rhetoric and practice of the open access data movement obscures both Native and Indigenous agency and sovereignty in determining the use of community materials as well as the role of technical determinism and automated computational access (e.g. APIs)  in proliferating the violence of colonial archives on Native communities. We illustrate how ""difficult heritage"" can assist digital humanists in thinking through not just the design and implementation of digital projects for NAIS communities but also the impact of NAIS data diffusion through open access protocols. And importantly, we suggest that the question of providing humanities research data is not just the deployment of an ecosystem for development, description, access, and reuse but a recognition that there are potentially multiple ecosystems of research and teaching that must exist simultaneously and be treated as part of a non-homogenous whole.",Open Access,"Heitman, Carolyn, Guiliano, Jennifer",Journal,Journal of Cultural Analytics,https://culturalanalytics.org/2019/08/difficult-heritage-and-the-complexities-of-indigenous-data/,,,10.22148/16.044,Article DOI,Difficult Heritage and the Complexities of Indigenous Data,2019

Heretofore, details of the progression from the Roman to medieval settlement have remained elusive. To clarify this history, we opened two trenches, one atop the topographical feature of the Monte di Salpi, long-believed to encase the remains of the medieval castrum, and one immediately below, along the plain, where evidence of the Roman and Late Antique town is most apparent. From the settlement adjacent to the lagoon, we determined these patterns: already in the mid-5th c. CE, the remains of what was a Roman utilitarian structure were re-inhabited by a series of huts within the preserved walls. A village occupation continued into the 7th c. CE, with a new occupation in the 8thc. CE. Abandonment occurred in the 9th c. CE, a break in settlement that persisted for perhaps two centuries until the foundation of Salpi in the early 11th c. (date from episcopal records). The excavation on the Monte has revealed structures of the 13th and 14th c. Through the stratigraphic section of a late 15th c. well, extending to the bottom of the Monte to about 5 m, we have convincing proof that the medieval castrum was constructed atop the remains of the Roman town.

In particular, it demonstrates the new rhetorical and emotional range of early ninth-century prayer texts written by and for literati companions.

While accounts of when the rule emerged vary widely, ranging from the 1660s to the 1920s, most legal scholars have assumed that once established, the rule created a bright line that people were bound to follow. This Article reconstructs the one-drop rule's meaning and purpose from 1600 to 1860, setting it within the context of racial migration, the continual process by which people of African descent assimilated into white communities.&#x0D; &#x0D; While ideologies of blood-borne racial difference predate Jamestown, the rhetoric of purity was always undermined by the realities of mixture. Cases such as Hudgins v. Wright and State v. Cantey simultaneously strengthened and undermined the color line, expressing confidence in the permanence of racial difference while allowing people of color to become white. Instead of simply widening the racial divide, restrictions on the liberty and livelihoods of African Americans pushed many into whiteness. As more people became vulnerable to reclassification, courts acted to preserve social stability in Southern communities, shielding them from the insecurity that an insistence on racial purity would engender.&#x0D; &#x0D; The one-drop rule's transformation from ideological current to legal bright line and presumed social reality is a story not of slavery, but of freedom. In the 1840s and 1850s, the prospect of emancipation hastened the rule's spread as whites attempted to preserve property relations in slavery's absence. In Northern border states such as Ohio, the rule emerged by 1860 as a legal argument and a social attitude. The rule's ostensible opponents - abolitionists - propagated it, deploying it as a rhetorical weapon to symbolize slavery's cruelty and to argue that Northern whites could be enslaved.

Their efforts often worsened the very physical conditions they sought to ameliorate.  By the beginning of the twentieth century, a new generation of Seattle residents, led by city and federal engineers, positioned themselves to ""finish"" nature by rescuing it both from its physical shortcomings and from those who had previously damaged it.4  With dikes, pipelines, sluices and hoses, engineers remade the river, but in so doing they also set forth a new social and ecological regime for the Duwamish.",,"Klingle, Matthew",Journal,Journal of the West,http://journalofthewest.abc-clio.com/,,ABC-Clio,,,"“Fluid Dynamics: Water, Power, and the Reengineering of Seattle’s Duwamish River”",2005
1069,FT-52796-04,"Environmental historians have tended, until recently, to overlook how inequality is generated and reinforced in the metropolitan landscape.  One way to historicize urban environmental justice is to analyze the transformation of property through space and time.  This essay explores how engineers and reformers in early twentieth-century Seattle launched several earthmoving projects, called regrades, to renovate the downtown core.  The regrades removed millions of tons of earth, flattened hills, and erased tidelands, but they also unleashed landslides and ripped apart neighborhoods populated by poor and minority residents.  Environmental volatility and social inequality thus reinforced one another to shape Seattle's political and physical geography.  By telling spatial stories about property, urban environmental historians can better map social power against shifting landscapes.",online,"Klingle, Matthew",Journal,Journal of Urban History,http://juh.sagepub.com/,,Sage Publications,,,"“Changing Spaces: Nature, Property, and Power in Seattle, 1890-1945” ",2006

France's colonial history and Frenchmen's reluctance to emigrate, as well as the violence of the military conquest, the difficulty of expropriating Algerian property, and the ""inaptitude"" of the first colonists, however, hindered the realization of this vision of a ""new France"" across the Mediterranean.

In North America, these discussions have largely centered on archaeology's shifting relationship with native peoples. As scholars give new attention to how research methodologies and representation of cultural histories affect indigenous peoples, it is critical to understand the unique ways in which Native Americans view their past. Contemporary Zuni and Hopi interpretations of ancestral landscapes in the San Pedro Valley of Arizona are used to explore how indigenous worldviews imbue ancient places with deep cultural and individual meanings. This research, based on a three-year collaborative ethnohistory project, argues for resolution to the ""contested past"" by incorporating a perspective of multivocality, which will enable the creation of alternative histories that do not eschew scientific principles while respecting native values of history.",,"Ferguson, T.

Using insights from social movement theory, this article focuses especially on the role of French government-sponsored reforms in 1919 in fostering the surge of Islamic activism in Algeria.

It uses these documents to explore a number of issues in relation to Datini's involvement with trade of materials for artists including:  how would Tuscan merchants such as Datini have viewed these goods?  To which cities would he have turned for their supply?  What might they tell us about overall networks during the period?

Noting that a significant strain of commentary on the scandal sought to separate Byron's literary genius from the matter of his personal behavior, Ryan argues that this case study allows us to situate the declining relevance of authorial character to the question of literary valuation rather earlier in the century than scholars have typically claimed. More significantly, the Stowe/Byron scandal prefigures the unevenness and contestation that would accompany that development as well as the degree to which it would be complicated by the very identity categories and political investments that such a text-centered approach seems intent on eliding.  Ryan goes on to claim that book advertisements and other archival sources support the claim--advanced by both nineteenth-century commentators and twentieth-century scholars--that the scandal enhanced Byron's status and sales. The ensuing damage to Stowe's career, on the other hand, has been much exaggerated.

The Army, which needed to attract more than 20,000 recruits each month, turned to market research and advertising, began internal reform, and offered new benefits, portraying military service as opportunity rather than obligation. The turn to the labor market had political implications. As women and African Americans joined the military in unprecedented numbers, the Army served as a site of social experimentation, directly confronting the social change movements of the 1960s or 1970s and their legacies. Because an AVF requires high reenlistment rates and family-oriented benefits help retain soldiers, army dependents have come to far exceed army members, with implications for deployment, morale, and cost. And defining military service as labor market opportunity rather than citizen's obligation is a critical shift in political definitions of citizenship.",,Beth Bailey,Journal,The Forum,http://www.bepress.com/forum/vol9/iss3/,Political Science journal homepage,bepress,,,"“A Political History of the All-Volunteer Army,” ",2011
1241,FA-52915-07,"This article, along with the epilogue of my book, Suffering Childhood, was researched and written with the support of a 6-month NEH Faculty grant.   Article abstract:  In this essay, Duane argues that reading two disparate texts together—the largely unknown school records chronicling the work of antebellum black children and a text by the most prominent African American author in the canon—allows a powerful model to emerge for reading the mediated voices of children, slaves, and other marginalized people. Duane recovers and analyzes the records of the New York African Free School in the 1810s and 1820s, an archive that features the work of the first generation of black children to inherit freedom in New York City. She argues that the scripted performances of the NYAFS students offer insight into a set of overlapping cultural metaphors that structured black-white relations throughout the nineteenth century and beyond. The interaction between black students and white teachers anticipates the treatment that many early black abolitionists received from white abolitionists—of which the famous clash between Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison is the most prominent example. By untangling the assumptions that underlie these performances, Duane suggests that we can better understand and analyze other interactions scripted by the overarching and intertwined beliefs that African Americans were children, and that children's subjectivities could be shaped according to the will of their educators.",,Anna Mae Duane,,,http://americanliterature.dukejournals.org/content/82/3/461.abstract,"This is the link to the journal site.

Whereas philosophers who share Kant's emphasis on aesthetic validity discount art's capacity for truth, philosophers who share Hegel's critique of Kant render artistic truth inaccessible. This essay proposes a critical hermeneutic account of aesthetic validity that supports a non-esoteric notion of artistic truth. Using Gadamer and Adorno to read Kant through Hegelian eyes, I reconstruct the aesthetic dimension from three polarities in modern Western societies. Then I describe aesthetic validity as an horizon of imaginative cogency governing the exploration, presentation, and creative interpretation of aesthetic signs. The essay argues that aesthetic processes, so construed, are crucial to cultural pathfinding, and that aesthetic validity claims in art talk contribute significantly to this pursuit.

Based on analysis of the Romani language, Roma tribes likely originated in ancient India. They appear abruptly in central European sources in the 15th century. In the modern era, their persecution during the Holocaust. But what happened in the millenium spent migrating through Central Asia and the Middle East?  In a recent publication (Richardson 2017), we learn that as early as the 9th century, a heterogeneous tribal confederation, known in Arabic as the Banu Sasan, comprised not only the Roma, but also the Armenian Lom and Levantine Dom Gypsies of Indian origin, as well as Arabic-speaking and Persian-speaking itinerant groups indigenous to the Middle East. They shared a tribal dialect known as Sin that is still spoken in Egypt and the Sudan today.In the 13th century the Banu Sasan renamed themselves Strangers, an autonym that denoted Gypsy-like peoples, broadly, of any geographical origin or language group.  This essay examines the invisibility of the Strangers in Middle Eastern and Central Asian historiography. In the first half of this study, I seek to show how the work of 19th- and 20th-century European and North American philologists, medievalists, and ethnographers delegitimized the Strangers' language and the culture that this language expressed.

We argue that the most successful forays of applied archaeological research into sustainability encompass three major realms: social foundations and local histories of any human community, economic resources and practices to support that community, and environmental and geological couplings existing therein. This paper explores dynamic relationships between these three spheres by discussing how nineteenth and twentieth century farmers, land managers, landowners, and their families in the San Pasquale Valley (SPQV), Calabria, Italy, created and maintained a vibrant community founded for the commercial production of bergamot, mulberries, olives, grapes, and a wide variety of fruit, nut, vegetable, and cereal crops. Our theoretical approach combines Lave and Wenger's (1991) community of practice approach with Scarborough's (2009) model of labor- and techno-tasking strategies to document laborscapes through time, using architectural documentation, oral histories, documentary evidence, oral histories, ethnographic interviews, and climate modeling. We demonstrate the interpretive power of incorporating cultural foundations into environmental and economic models to produce more comprehensive understandings of how people succeed and fail to sustain livelihoods and communities. We argue that rhythms and nuances of linkages between SPQV environment, economy, and social worlds require a more flexible conceptualization of sustainability to encompass the variety of solutions developed by current SPQV community members to craft sustainable economic and social futures for themselves.",subscription only,"Meredith S.

To explore this question, I investigate women's perceptions of normal relations, practices, status, and gendered self in an intense situation of wartime survival, the Blockade of Leningrad (1941–1944), an 872-day ordeal that demographically feminized the city. Using Blockade diaries for data on everyday life, perceptions, and practices, I show how women's gendered skills and habits of breadseeking and caregiving (finding scarce resources and providing aid) were key to survival and helped elevate their sense of status. Yet this did not entice rethinking ""gender."" To explore status elevation and gender entrenchment, I build on Bourdieu's theory of habitus and fields to develop anchors: field entities with valence around which actors orient identities and practices. Anchors provide support for preexisting habitus and practices, and filter perceptions from new positions vis-&#x01;a-vis fields and concrete relations. Essentialist identities and practices were reinforced through two processes involving anchors. New status was linked to ""women's work"" that aided survival of anchors (close others, but also factories and the city), reinforcing acceptance of gender positions. Women perceived that challenging gender relations and statuses could risk well-being of anchors, reconstructing gender essentialism.",Subscription,Jeffrey K.

15810,FB-57514-14,"War can create a massive amount of death while also straining the capacity of states and civilians to cope with disposing of the dead. This paper argues that such moments exacerbate contradictions between three fields and ‘‘economies'' (logics of interaction and exchange) – a political, market, and moral economy of disposal – in which order and control, commodification and opportunism, and dignity are core logics. Each logic and economy, operating in its own field, provides an interpretation of the dead that emerges from field logics of normal organization, status, and meanings of subjects (as legal entities, partners in negotiation, and subjects with biographies and dignity). Using the case of the Blockade of Leningrad, with its massive amount of civilian death, this essay examines how local authorities followed an expedient logic to maintain order; how state workers charged with disposal followed an instrumental logic of gain; and how civilians tried to maintain a logic of dignity but were forced by desperation to act contingently and instrumentally. The analysis suggests a broader application of field theory beyond organizational communities; how culture in fields operates via entities of valence (anchors); and the need to make emotions and social distance clearer in frameworks of fields, culture, and practice.",Subscription,Jeffrey K.

15812,FB-57514-14,"In wartime, a crucial state goal is mobilizing civilians to sacrifice for the war effort and to feel a sense of loyalty to state and nation, and by extension to relevant elites. All talk and efforts for creating a loyal subject of a nation (or other political entity) are put to the test in war. One extreme case of the shock and suffering of war was the Blockade of Leningrad, where the 872-day siege led to mass death as well as suffering and created a new world of survival tactics and expedient policies. The research on the agitprop in Leningrad during the Blockade leads to a curious conclusion. Criticizing Stalin and Bolshevism were beyond the pale—but criticizing local structures, procedures, and collective habits could have worked, especially if one avoided criticizing Smolny and did criticized in the spirit of samokritika. Yet the persistence of blaming individual motivations and psychology suggests a real move away from the core logic of Marxism and even Leninism. In this sense, the political culture of Leningrad in the Blockade and the USSR at war might have been closer to the individualism of Anglo-American political culture—closer than either side would want to admit.",Open access,Jeffrey K.

15813,FB-57514-14,"Abstract: The Blockade of Leningrad was a tragedy that significantly affected all aspects of everyday civilian life. One such area was gender: from jobs to families and much more, the roles, identities, and practices of women and men shifted, sometimes profoundly. One such area was intimacy and sensuality. This paper briefly explores how the combination of material deprivation and shifts in women's responsibilities and status in the besieged city created competing norms vis-à-vis the ""proper"" nature of sexuality and intimacy. In particular, after desexualization in the first Blockade winter — where sex drives and senses of femininity and masculinity were under assault by severe food and material deprivation — a resexualization followed once food availability stabilized. However, the return of senses of sexuality and intimacy was not without tension: in particular, a tension over the legitimate position of intimacy and sensuality in relation to deferring such feelings to discipline oneself and devote energy and attention to the war effort. In the sphere of everyday life, a politics of resexualization began to emerge in Leningrad in 1943.",Open access,Jeffrey K.

15819,FT-264970-19,"Around the same time the political controversy was brewing in the US over the removal of the Confederate statues, a parallel controversy was unfolding in Barcelona around the fate of a monument that was originally erected in 1884 to honor the Spanish financier Antonio López y López (1817-1883), who had traveled to Cuba in his youth and made his fortune through illegal slave-trafficking. The figure of López has always been entangled with national politics, as the wealth he amassed through this illegal activity allowed him to establish three commercial enterprises that played a major role not only in the industrial development of Catalonia in the nineteenth century, but also in sustaining colonialism in Africa and Spanish America.   This essay will analyze the debates surrounding the removal of López's statue by the city of Barcelona in March 2018 , considering not only his place in Spanish colonial history, but also the changing historical circumstances that turned the statue into the object of different controversies, from the moment of its construction and reconstruction, to its final removal in 2018. The article will consider the following questions: What cultural myths and narratives around this figure were being privileged at particular moments in history and why? What impact have the debates around the monument had on how Barcelona's colonial past has been defined, interpreted, and (re)framed? What possibilities do the public space on which López's statue once stood offer for refiguring national history and identity in Spain today? Finally, the article will establish connections with the recent public debates surrounding the removal of the Confederate monuments in the United States, while recognizing the different historical and geopolitical contexts in which these monuments linked to slavery were erected and dismantled.",,Akiko Tsuchiya,Journal,Nineteenth-Century Contexts,https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/WDIEZ2DDJICUEZFPAVMP/full?target=10.1080/08905495.2019.1657735,,,,,"Monuments and Public Memory: Antonio López y López, Slavery, and the Cuban-Catalan Connection",2019

Dating around the early 6th century AD and carrying a monumental primary cargo of partially prefabricated religious and decorative architectural elements, the ship was almost certainly lost while en route for a building program somewhere in the late antique west. Annual fieldwork campaigns over the past five years have shed new light on the major architectural assemblage, while revealing additional cargo, shipboard items, and traces of the hull itself.

15976,RZ-249831-16,"The question of complex socio-political organization among pastoral nomadic groups has long posed a theoretical challenge for anthropologists, historians, and archaeologists alike. The problems arise from a disciplinary tendency to view pastoralists within a narrow economic and ecological framework but, in addition to this, the basic conception of ‘complexity' has itself proven problematic. The definitions of complexity built originally upon systems theory and political economy place emphasis on organizational criteria derived primarily from sedentary societies with class stratification, intensive subsistence economies, and centralized administration. In this paper we argue that these classic definitions of complexity have not provided a good fit for analyzing the kinds of political organizations constructed by pastoral nomads of the Eurasian steppe zone. For that reason, we explore new ways of conceptualizing complex organization based on processes of integration, scale, and mobility. This approach offers a better explanation for material patterns documented across two neighboring valleys in northern Mongolia and provides substantial insight to the sub-regional polities preceding the rise of the Xiongnu state during the late first millennium BCE.",,"Burentogtokh, J, W.

In particular, it shows how discussions surrounding the deportation and repatriation of foreign women involved in prostitution unearthed a number of enduring questions about sex work and trafficking: How do we distinguish between forced and free migrations? Is victimhood a necessary condition for receiving social assistance? Can humanitarian interventions, in the name of rescue and rehabilitation, enable restrictive or even punitive measures?

Burney expressed her grief later and elsewhere, particularly in her little-known commonplace book, ""Consolatory Extracts occasioned by the tragic death of her sister Susan Phillips in January 1800,"" which reveals her protracted process of mourning through her appropriation of extracts from A Series of Letters Between Mrs. Elizabeth Carter and Miss Catherine Talbot, from the year 1741 to 1770 (1809) and its composition following her mastectomy in 1811.  Many of the themes in ""Consolatory Extracts"" suggest that Burney's memorializing of Susan is similarly borne out in her fictional works, particularly her unfinished tragedy Elberta (1785-1814) and her novel The Wanderer (1814).",Subscription only / available in print or through Project Muse,Hilary Havens,Journal,Eighteenth-Century Life,https://read.dukeupress.edu/eighteenth-century-life,Journal website,Eighteenth-Century Life // Duke University Press,,,"“Memorializing Sorrow in Frances Burney’s ‘Consolatory Extracts'""",2019
16003,FEL-257990-18,"This paper analyzes ""production stories,"" a genre of information literature and media responsible for teaching children how everyday things are made. As nineteenth-century families increasingly consumed tropical commodities produced by the enslaved, including sugar, tea, coffee, rum, and tobacco, the production story developed in Britain and the United States as a way to explain to children where everyday household goods originate, making global trade networks visible in the home. These ""production stories"" developed strategies for raising or eliding ethical questions posed by who makes things, under what conditions, and for whom. Focusing on stories of sugar production, I find that production stories reveal surprising details about technical processes for making things, but conceal the human cost of production. They also end with consumption, when children use the products, symbolically affirming the conditions under which they were produced. Drawing on scholarship from the history of technology and the history of the Atlantic slave trade, I contend that these problematic representations of manufacturing processes feed into and support whitewashed histories for children. I conclude by analyzing contemporary picturebooks that resist these genre patterns and encourage positive identification with enslaved black characters, who like child readers, are at once makers, readers, and consumers.",subscription only,Elizabeth Massa Hoiem,Journal,Children's Literature in Education,,,Springer,,,"“The Progress of Sugar: Consumption as Complicity in Children’s Books about Slavery and Manufacturing, 1790-2015.”",2020

16055,FEL-257634-18,"Note that the draft of this paper was submitted for peer review before the grant period, and its primary concern is another architectural project. However, the techniques it describes were improved and a code base released during the grant period. These analytical tools are also fundamental to the visualization techniques I am using for the Olympia project, and I continued working on them during the grant period. I also spent about one week revising the text in late summer 2018, edited proofs in early 2019, and the paper was published in Spring 2019.  Abstract: This article presents a new algorithm for the automated reconstruction and visualization of damaged ancient inscriptions. After reviewing current methods for enhancing incisions, a hybrid approach is adopted that combines advantages of 2D and 3D analytical techniques. A photogrammetric point cloud of an inscription is projected orthographically from an ideal vantage point, generating a 2.5D raster, including channels describing depth and surface derivatives. The next consideration is the obstacle to legibility posed by breaks in the ancient surface, which motivates the development of a new segmentation algorithm based on SLIC superpixels with region-merging adapted to operate on the geometry of the inscribed surface instead of color or intensity values. The algorithm classifies surface points by their likelihood of belonging to the uninscribed original plane, deliberate strokes, or breaks. Results are visualized in a manner suited for epigraphical analysis and publication through static images. Two case studies demonstrate the power and flexibility of this method, which has indicated changes to the reading of IG XIV 1, an early Greek text that has been debated for more than 150 years.",Available to subscribers to the journal or the ACM digital library (not Open Access),Philip Sapirstein,Journal,ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage,https://doi.org/10.1145/3286977,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,"Segmentation, Reconstruction, and Visualization of Ancient Inscriptions in 2.5D",2019

16096,RQ-249842-16,"This special issue on new directions in making and knowing follows on the recent publication of Ways of Making and Knowing: The Material Culture of Empirical Knowledge (2014), coedited by Pamela H. Smith, Amy R. W. Meyers, and Harold J. Cook, published in the Bard Graduate Center series Cultural Histories of the Material World. That volume and the interdisciplinary conference in 2005 that gave rise to it aimed to show the ways that ""making"" and ""knowing"" are not just related or part of a multistage process—that making constitutes knowing over time—but that making is actually constitutive of knowing in a scientific sense. The five-day conference involved more than seventy participants, and it included scholarly lectures and—more unusual ten years ago—object-based breakout sessions that brought academic scholars together with museum scholars, curators, conservators, and practitioners of the arts. The attendees gathered around objects brought from multiple collections of the great London museums to discuss the modes of making and knowing that had been employed in the objects' fabrication, as well as to examine the ways in which natural materials had been used and the means by which nature and its materials were represented in those objects. The long process by which that conference and its many insights were whittled down into a standard-length book format filled largely with scholarly essays proved to be long and somewhat dispiriting. We found, as any early modern artist knew, that text just was not an optimal vehicle for object-based interdisciplinary discussion of making processes.

The challenge is even greater when applying automatic indexing to historical documents for a multidisciplinary collection, such as encyclopedias. The research presented in this paper explores this challenge with an automatic indexing comparative study examining topic relevance. The setting is the NEH-funded 19th-Century Knowledge Project, where researchers in the Digital Scholarship Center, Temple University, and the Metadata Research Center, Drexel University, are investigating the best way to index entries across four historical editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica (3rd, 7th, 9th, and 11th editions). Individual encyclopedia entry entries were processed using the Helping Interdisciplinary Vocabulary Engineering (HIVE) system, a linked-data, automatic indexing terminology application that uses controlled vocabularies. Comparative topic relevance evaluation was performed for three separate keyword extraction algorithms: RAKE, Maui, and Kea++. Results show that RAKE performed the best, with an average of 67% precision for RAKE, and 28% precision for both Maui and Kea++. Additionally, the highestranked HIVE results with both RAKE and Kea++ demonstrated relevance across all sample entries, while Maui's highest-ranked results returned zero relevant terms. This paper reports on background information, research objectives and methods, results, and future research prospects for further optimization of RAKE's algorithm parameters to accommodate for encyclopedia entries of different lengths, and evaluating the indexing impact of correcting the historical Long S.",Open access,"Grabus, Sam, Greenberg, Jane, Logan, Peter, Boone, Joan",Journal,Proceedings from North American Symposium on Knowledge Organization,https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/15635/13017,"PDF file of the article, Sam Grabus, Jane Greenberg, Peter Logan, and Joan Boone. 2019.

16136,FN-260668-18,"In this paper, I discuss the notion of obviation in the language isolate, Ktunaxa,2 and in the Central Algonquian language, Meskwaki. While there are important differences between these two languages with respect to obviation, my concern in this paper is with a feature of obviation found in both languages—namely, that proximate shifts are often not accompanied by proximate switches. That is, while a proximate shift introduces a new proximate, the previous proximate need not, and frequently, does not, become obviative when a new proximate is introduced.  Although this fact is well known, I believe it has a consequence that has been under-appreciated.  I will argue that an implication of proximate shifts not being proximate switches, is that proximate shifts fail to track discourse prominence in a narrative.  By 'track discourse prominence', here, I mean, systematically identify the most discourse-prominent referent in the narrative. It is widely assumed that when a proximate shift occurs, the new proximate becomes most discourse prominent at that point in the narrative, and remains so until the next proximate shift. Nevertheless, the central aim of this paper is to argue that this assumption should be rejected. Specifically, I will argue that when a proximate shift does not include the previous proximate becoming obviative, the previous proximate retains its proximate status and that, therefore, the status of the new proximate is not more discourse prominent than the preceding proximate; instead their relationship is one of discourse parity.  Because such proximate shifts without switches are frequent, it will often be the case that a proximate shift does not produce a new most-discourse-prominent referent. Hence, simply tracking the new proximate in successive proximate shifts will not systematically identify the most discourse-prominent referent in a narrative",,Irene Appelbaum,Journal,Papers of the Algonquian Conference,https://algonquianconference.atlas-ling.ca/eng/publications/http://,Algonquian Conference Publications website,Michigan State University Press,,,The Importance of Being Not-Obviative,2019
16137,FN-260668-18,"Kutenai morphosyntax exhibits both direction-marking and obviation. Direction is a binary distinction that characterizes transitive clauses in terms of the relative rank of the clause's two arguments. Obviation is a binary distinction that characterizes noun phrases in terms of their relative rank insofar as it distinguishes the most highly-ranked NP in a sentence from any and all other NPs in the sentence. While recognized as distinct phenomena, obviation and direction-marking are widely thought to interact as follows. The relative rank of arguments is determined by obviation status, and obviation status, in turn, is determined largely by pragmatic and semantic factors.  Despite the widespread acceptance of this view,  the central aim of this paper is to argue that there are good grounds for questioning it. I'll argue that there is a class of cases—double-obviative constructions—that the standard view does not account for. The import of these cases is not that they are exceptions per se , but that the attempt to account for them reveals that the received view is problematic even in the standard cases. In the first instance, accounting for double-obviative constructions leads to the conclusion that obviation status is not needed to mediate between discourse and semantic considerations on the one hand, and direction-marking, on the other. But closer examination shows that instead of simply being superfluous, the received view seems to fundamentally reverse the order of priority between discourse decisions that the speaker makes and the linguistic encoding of these decisions. While this paper deals exclusively with Kutenai, its conclusion may have implications for discussions of obviation and direction in Algonquian languages as well.",,Irene Appelbaum,Other,Proceedings of the Western Conference on Linguistics,https://wecol.weebly.com/proceedings.html,Western Conference on Linguistics Proceedings website,"Department of Linguistics California State University, Fresno",,,Double-Obviatives and Direction-Marking in Kutenai,2019
16138,HAA-261239-18,"This essay shows how face detection and recognition algorithms, applied to frames extracted from a corpus of moving images, can capture formal elements present in media beyond shot length and average color measurements. Locating and identifying faces makes it possible to algorithmically extract time-coded labels that directly correspond to concepts and taxonomies established within film theory. For example, knowing the size of detected faces, for example, provides a direct link to the concept of shot framing. The blocking of a scene can similarly be deduced by knowing the relative positions of identified characters within a specific cut. Once produced on a large scale, these extracted formal elements can be aggregated to explore visual style across a collection of materials. It is then possible to understand how visual style is used within the internal construction of narrative and as a way to engage broadly with external cultural forces. The method is an example of an approach to large scale image analysis that Arnold and Tilton have termed distant viewing.",open access,"Taylor Arnold, Lauren Tilton, Annie Berke",Journal,,https://culturalanalytics.org/2019/07/visual-style-in-two-network-era-sitcoms/,,Journal of Cultural Analytics,,,Visual Style in Two Network Era Sitcoms,2019

First, sympathetic imagination may afford a deeper and more sensitive type of aesthetic engagement.

Kant does not explicitly mention Gerard's 1759 Essay on Taste, but it was probably an influence on his own conception of free play, and in any case a comparison of the two theories of aesthetic response is instructive. Gerard's development of a version of the theory of free play without Kant's assumptions that aesthetic judgments must be independent of concepts and yet always intersubjectively valid allows him to accommodate a variety of facts about aesthetic experience in general and our experience of the fine arts in particular more readily and more fully than Kant can, especially those concerning the affective dimension of our experience of art.",,Paul Guyer,Journal,Journal of Scottish Philosophy,http://www.scottishphilosophy.org/journalofscottishphilosophy.html,Journal of Scottish Philosophy,Edinburgh University Press,,,Gerard and Kant: Influence and Opposition,2011

1525,RA-50040-06,"Based on a larger project investigating music making as an integral part of Ottoman and Turkish social history, this article seeks to understand surviving musical resonances across ethnoreligious communities in Turkey today. It specifically explores Jewish religious music and its interconnections with a wider Ottoman-Turkish musical culture that has sustained historical traces in Turkish synagogues today. Focusing primarily on a Jewish musical form with close links to Ottoman court music, the Maftirim repertoire, the study investigates the changing urban landscape of intercommunal music making as the Ottoman Empire ended and the Turkish nation was built. Through composer biographies and ethnographic methodologies of oral history within an interdisciplinary theoretical approach, the analysis seeks to articulate the places and people circulating in a late Ottoman music world and sharing patterns of patronage, aesthetic understandings, professional specialization, and master-pupil relations. The social ethos of this art world provides the foundation for tracing Ottoman-Turkish-Jewish music making in the republic. By pursuing not only minority human and cultural losses in the twentieth century but also the musical lives of those Jews who remained in Turkey, the article elucidates continuities in Ottoman lines of transmission and interethnic music making to explain the performance of Maftirim in Istanbul today. It argues that it was through alternative patrons and civic spaces that Turkish Jewish religious musicians participated with their non-Jewish counterparts in sustaining at-risk, albeit changing, Ottoman cultural forms in the face of state and commercial cultural interests.",subscription only,Maureen Jackson,Journal,"Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East pp. 569-587",http://cssaame.dukejournals.org/gca?allch=&amp;submit=Go&amp;gca=ddcsa%3B31%2F3%2F569,abstract as above,Duke University Press,,,"Crossing Musical Worlds: Ottoman Jewry, Music Making, and the Rise of the Nation ",2011

1576,FT-52199-04,"Historians of science have often looked to the authentication of miracles at canonization trials as a way to investigate the ways in which religious and scientific understandings of the natural and the miraculous came together and, sometimes, into conflict. Most historians of science who have forayed into the world of miracles have, understandably, stopped at the moment of a saint's canonization. Examining the treatment of a saint's miracles both before and after the canonization process, however, yields a different picture. Drawing upon materials from the 1455 canonization and subsequent cult of the Dominican Vincent Ferrer (1350–1419), this essay reveals, first, that papal approval marked only one of several ways in which miracles received publicly-accepted ""authentication,"" and second, that, after the moment of canonization, the idea of carefully authenticated miracles became irrelevant not simply for the great masses of the faithful, but also for the ecclesiastical hierarchy, who adopted an ever shifting rhetoric of authenticity as authors used tales of the saint's ""authentic"" miracles to drive home their own various polemical points.",,Laura Ackerman Smoller,Journal,"Church History 80, no. 4 (2011): 773-97.",http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8437501,Church History online,,,,“From Authentic Miracles to a Rhetoric of Authenticity:  Examples from the Canonization and Cult of St. Vincent Ferrer.”,2011

Part Two addresses the film's genre inscription and cinematic qualities and relates its embedded values to its enthusiastic reception across America 1916-18. Although the ethnographic documentary pays admiring tribute to laboring men and women throughout China, it also valorizes the moribund Chinese empire, as embodied in Brodsky's ultimate patron in China, President Yuan Shikai. While fully eschewing the ""Yellow Menace"" U.S. discourse of its period, Trip humorously delineates the East and West as essentially different. The rare work's exceptional critical and popular success from California to New York City points to Brodsky's skilled showmanship and ability to engage the support of independent movie distributors and investors.

1650,FA-56087-11,"ABSTRACT OF ARTICLE BY CURRY (only American author in the book):   Histories of Chinese cinema have long credited the Russian American immigrant Benjamin Brodsky (1877-1960) with founding production companies in Shanghai and Hong Kong as early as 1909 and initiating filmmaking collaborations with local Chinese.  Closer examination reveals those accounts to be sketchy assertions offered without documentation. Recent original transnational research, conducted in part among U.S. government archives and library holdings now available on-line, has yielded evidence that reframes and elaborates the historical narrative.  This essay departs from a 1915 American film trade journal report and its illustrating photograph and from a tale in Brodsky's unpublished autobiography to demonstrate his unexpected connections to members of the Chinese elite around 1912-1916.  A chance shipboard meeting led to Brodsky's acquaintance with several Chinese graduates of American universities and through them the early republican minister Zhou Ziqi.  Extensive records suggest that these Chinese returned students themselves motivated and through family and political connections helped to facilitate Brodsky's shift in 1913-1914 from limited film distribution in China into production, including of A Trip Through China (1916). The new findings have intriguing implications for histories of early twentieth-century trans-Pacific cultural associations as well as of Chinese cinema.

1666,FA-55502-10,"Abstract:  The scholarship on gender in the Middle East has overwhelmingly taken two objectives as its mandate:  First, to dismantle the stereotype of the silent, passive, subordinate, victimized and powerless Muslim woman; and second, to challenge the exceptionalism of Islam as a monolithic entity shaping women's condition in the same way in all places. The urgency of the tasks involved in this endeavor has been heightened by the fact that gender has come to demarcate battle lines in geo-political struggles since 9/11 and to occupy a central place in the discourse of international relations in regard to Muslim countries. In an effort to reflect major developments in the field, I offer in this article a critical analysis of the scholarship on issues that I see as constituting the core of the intellectual discourse on gender in the Middle East. These include: the critique of Orientalism past and present; the exploration of the diversity within Islam; the study of states and gender with respect to symbolic representations, institutions as well as kin-based solidarities; the analysis of women's agency; and the debates surrounding feminism and the veil.",Subscription only,Mounira M.

1998,RA-50057-07,"Six cases are drawn from the UAE's rich archaeological past which, in the author's view, assume their true significance when viewed in light of current discussions of globalization, ‘big history' and multi-scalar analysis in social/historical research. The examples include the early peopling of the UAE; the contact with Mesopotamia during the so-called Ubaid period, c. 6000-4000 B.C.; the contact with Mesopotamia during the Jamdat Nasr period, c. 3000 B.C.; the place of the UAE in the trans-continental system of trade involving Mesopotamia, the Gulf region, Iran, Central Asia and the Indus Valley, at the end of the 3rd millennium B.C.; the involvement of the UAE within the spheres of influence of the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian Empires during the mid-1st millennium B.C.; and finally the UAE in relation to the 1st century A.D. system of inter-continental trade extending from Western Europe and the Mediterranean to China and Southeast Asia.&#x0D; &#x0D; The argument is advanced that the significance of developments such as these cannot be taken for granted. By being overly restrictive and narrow, historians and archaeologists who work on material such as this are doing a disservice to the UAE and its past. Their responsibility, rather, is to make clear how and why the processes in which the UAE took part throughout history matter at the level of globalization in the past and ‘big history', and why a multi-scalar view of the UAE's history is a rewarding and exciting enterprise. By striving to make the UAE's past a part of a broader, global historical discourse in the 21st century, the true historical significance of many of the historical developments that took place here will become better known, both nationally and internationally.&#x0D; ",Article in Collection.,"Potts, Daniel","Journal, Other","Perspectives on recording UAE History,",http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncdr.ae%2Fncdr%2FNew%2520Perspectives%2520on%2520Recording%2520UAE%2520History%2FAbstracts%2FProf.Daniel%2520T.Potts.doc&amp;ei=8EK9T5WuAaKA6QGTrtk4&amp;usg=AFQjCNHs,Abstract .DOC file,National Center for Documentation &amp; Research,,,"Globalization, “big history” and multi-scalar analysis: Conceptualizing 8000 years of the UAE’s cultural development",2009

Even if computers and network technologies in the early 1990s were limited in their capacities to produce, distribute and present sound, a variety of communities and companies found ways to use the Web towards sonic ends. From early websites where users traded sound-related texts (MIDI files, song lyrics, guitar tablature, etc.) to the noises of new technologies (e.g. podcasts), the Web's sounds have shaped the economic, industrial, legal and cultural logics of the platform.

16210,FT-265568-19,"The release of Frank Miller's Holy Terror in 2006 inspired a backlash by conflating terrorism with Islam, and catering to the Islamophobic attitudes which emerged in the immediate post 9/11 period. Almost immediately, numerous authors and critics identified the need for a vigorous Muslim engagement with graphic novels – work that could counterbalance the tendency to reduce Muslim characters to villainous caricatures.  Still, the actual introduction of a Muslim protagonist in a graphic novel took some time: the presentation of Kamala Khan by Willow Wilson as the new Ms. Marvel (2014) was heralded by readers and critics alike as a much-anticipated counter-narrative. Ms. Marvel: No Normal and Generation Why feature Kamala Khan, an American-born Pakistani girl, who struggles to negotiate between her conservative background and teenage anxieties as a second-generation immigrant. In this series, the creator, Muslim-American Willow Wilson, combats anti-Muslim attitudes, and draws attention to common grounds between Islam and Christianity. But the graphic novel form offers particular challenges as well as advantages when compared to mainstream American Muslim fiction: an audience traditionally skeptical of overtly political works and especially the central presence of ""identity politics""; the necessity of conveying Muslim identity through recognizable visual elements without reducing that identity to simplistic clichés, etc. This paper will explore the ways in which Islam is used as a thematic frame through which to challenge misconceptions about the faith group, while also tracing the techniques graphic novelists (such as Tom Craig's Habibi, or Ahmad Philips's The Muslims) use to mask or minimize the impact of that challenge.",Book,Esra Santesso,Other,"Hyphenations: Muslim Writers, Artists, and Performers in America",,,Syracuse University Press,,,"""Muslim Superhero and American Multiculturalism""",2019

Abu Shadi's early nod to world literature (1908–1909) intimates the challenge of making literary particularity heard in the homogenizing harmonies of a world dominated by English. That problem persists in his account of a 1926 meeting with the Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore and in an essay of 1928 inspired by that meeting: one of the first manifestos of  al-adab al-'alami  (world literature) in Arabic, predating the 1936 appearance of  al-adab al-muqaran  (comparative literature). While Abu Shadi lauds Tagore's refusal to compare literatures East and West and insistence on the spiritual unity of all literatures, his struggles to articulate a world in which harmony is not an alibi for hierarchy suggest that neither comparative literature nor its would-be leveler—world literature—can shed the haunting specter of inequality.",Subscription only,Shaden M.

16250,FB-57287-13,"This article looks at the early history of art music in Israel. ""Israelism"" is best introduced by showing how, paradoxically, it influenced several core American works. This in turn contextualizes Israelism in Israeli music. Focusing on the nationalist ideology that shaped the choices of leading Israeli composers, I suggest that Israel's composers treat Mizrahi (literally Eastern or Oriental, mostly Middle Eastern) musical sources as the Other—but simultaneously also as their ancient Self. Moreover, I also argue that folklorism in Israel means the use of local traditional tunes that are simultaneously international. Following a section on the meanings of the Mizrah (Orient) in Israel, I present composers' views, from St. Petersburg, where Jewish nationalism in music began, to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, where it has endured in distinct opposition to the Russian Jewish School. Three composers' writings constitute the core of the ideological analysis: Paul Ben-Haim's 1953 interview on his Israeli identity in music; Mordecai Seter's 1960 essay on the East–West synthesis in Israeli music; and Josef Tal's 1960 essay, in which he opposes nationalistic works based on folklore, but reveals no less nationalistic undertones in his own approach to writing contemporary music. These hermeneutic analyses serve as representative samples for the discussion of prevalent attitudes. The article looks at these composers' ideological essays to show their Zionist biases, utopian aspirations, and the construction of national styles. The article also examines the idea that music made in Israel is different from contemporary music in Europe and America, yet avoids the traps of essentialism and Israeli exceptionalism, comparable to American exceptionalism.",Subscription only,Ronit Seter,Journal,The Musical Quarterly,http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/musqtl/gdu010,,Oxford University Press,,,"Israelism: Nationalism, Orientalism, and the Israeli Five",2014

Recent research, however, primarily by economic historians, has demonstrated that large numbers of Famine refugees actually fared rather well in the United States, saving surprising sums in bank accounts and making strides up the American socioeconomic ladder. These scholars, however, have never attempted to explain why some Famine immigrants thrived in the United States while others struggled merely to scrape by. Utilizing the unusually detailed records of New York's Emigrant Savings Bank in conjunction with the methods of the digital humanities, this article seeks to understand what characteristics separated those Irish Famine immigrants who fared well financially from those who did not. Analysis of a database of more than 15,000 depositors suggests that networking was the key to economic advancement for the Famine immigrants. Those who lived in residential enclaves with other immigrants born in the same Irish parish saved significantly more than other immigrants, and those who created employment niches based on Irish birthplace also amassed more wealth than those who did not.

16290,PW-234885-16,"Formal historic preservation is a professional and sanctioned approach to the conservation of our historically significant built cultural heritage. Postindustrial landscapes are, by definition, functionally and materially obsolete, and in many cases derelict and decaying. While they hold historical significance, these sites are often not widely perceived as valuable contributors to our heritage. Yet these landscapes persist. We argue that the material persistence of these features is the result of generally unrecognized processes of informal material conservation.  In this paper, we outline a new framework, vernacular preservation, an ontology for heritage professionals to use in considering how to approach and recognize nonformal interventions that result in the protection of heritage resources. Here, we use the postindustrial landscape of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula—a former copper-mining district—to illustrate how vernacular preservation differs from formal historic preservation, reviewing the process of vernacular preservation and how it is activated in practice.  Vernacular preservation constitutes perhaps the most traditional, common, and widespread mechanism of material conservation of the historical built environment yet has been largely invisible, little discussed, and undertheorized by the heritage preservation community. Understanding this preservation process begins by acknowledging its existence and by extending the heritage dialogue to include these underrepresented historical properties and their important role in defining postindustrial landscapes. We conclude the paper with a discussion on how this novel approach to thinking about preservation extends broadly to the field and should be given greater attention.",,"Arnold, John, Lafreniere, Don",Journal,Change over Time: An International Journal of Conservation and the Built Environment 7(2) (2017): 114-133.,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/685484,,,,,The Persistence of Time: Vernacular Preservation of the Postindustrial Landscape,2017

In this paper, we review the use of the public in crowdsourcing historical data creation, and using the Keweenaw Time Traveler set in Michigan's Copper Country as a case study, we call for a new approach to HGIS scholarship that includes a robust public partnership to building HGIS datasets. The creation of a public participatory HGIS approach to HGIS scholarship can increase efficiencies of, public relevance in, and extend the reach of, HGIS projects beyond the academy. We have established a set of best practices that include, incorporating the public in the HGIS interface design, providing immediate public data access, contextualization of spatial data in space-time, comprehensive public history outreach in person and online, and creating affordances for the public to contribute their own historical spatial knowledge through spatial storytelling.

The unique challenges of working within postindustrial landscapes and in collaboration with the communities that live in and connect to them remain thinly explored and demand greater attention.

16298,PW-234885-16,"Postindustrial urban landscapes are large-scale, complex manifestations of the past in the present in the form of industrial ruins and archaeological sites, decaying infrastructure, and adaptive reuse; ongoing processes of postindustrial redevelopment often conspire to conceal the toxic consequences of long-term industrial activity. The study of the postindustrial is still new, and requires interdisciplinary connections that remain either unexplored or underexplored. Archaeologists have begun to turn their attention to the modern industrial era and beyond. This focus carries the potential to deliver new understandings of the industrial and postindustrial city, yet archaeological attention to the postindustrial remains in its infancy. Developments in the ongoing digital revolution in archaeology and within the social sciences and humanities have the potential to contribute to the archaeological study of the postindustrial city. The development of historical GIS and historical spatial data infrastructures (HSDIs) using historical big data have enabled scholars to study the past over large spatial and temporal scales and support qualitative research, while retaining a high level of detail. This dissertation demonstrates how spatial technologies using big data approaches, especially the HSDI, enhance the archaeological study of postindustrial urban landscapes and ultimately contribute to meeting the ""grand challenge"" of integrating digital approaches into archaeology by coupling reflexive recording of archaeological knowledge production with globally accessible spatial digital data infrastructures. HSDIs show great potential for providing archaeologists working in postindustrial places with a means to curate and manipulate historical data on an industrial or urban scale, and to iteratively contextualize this longitudinal dataset with material culture and other forms of archaeological knowledge.",,"Trepal, Dan",Other,"Digital Commons @ Michigan Tech: Dissertations, Master's Theses and Master's Reports",https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/etdr/913/,,Michigan Technological University [PhD Dissertation],,,The Archaeology of the PostIndustrial: Spatial Data Infrastructures for Studying the Past in the Present,2019
16299,PW-234885-16,"The archaeology of postindustrial landscapes is still relatively undeveloped. The impact of economic, social, and urban development efforts on both tangible and intangible heritage complicate our attempts to understand these places. Despite this, integrating heritage practice and promotion into the regeneration of a postindustrial landscape continues to grow in popularity. Within this context, genuine public-expert collaboration is the most effective means towards developing a sustainable compromise between protecting community heritage values and fostering economic development and regeneration. In this paper, we suggest three broad categories of challenges for studying and promoting heritage in postindustrial regions – physical, social, and political – and propose a digital data-focused geospatial approach to how community archaeologists and heritage specialists may overcome these challenges. We argue that coupling this data and technology with a robust research agenda and public programming can serve as a crucial two-way link, enabling long-term sustainable heritage-promotion and protection in post-industrial communities.",,"Trepal, Dan, Scarlett, Sarah Fayen, Lafreniere, Don",Journal,Journal of Community Archaeology &amp; Heritage,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20518196.2019.1653516?journalCode=ycah20,,,,,Heritage Making through Community Archaeology and the Spatial Humanities,2019

One was in Nasu, the language of the ruling lineage; the other was in Chinese. Both commemorated the long, powerful line of Ne´ (or Yi) native chieftains to which Lady Qu was heir. Yet they gave contradictory accounts of the forms of chiefly succession, sources of political authority, and geopolitical position of the native domain. The inscriptions show that chiefly sovereignty was neither merely embodied in ancestral authority nor simply endowed by the emperor. Sovereignty—particularly that of a female chieftain—was the capacity to master both modes of self-description while embodying their incompatibility. While we often understand colonialism through power-laden projects of translation, Lady Qu's inscriptions give evidence that Ming colonization of the southwest might require a different approach. Native chieftains were often the ""imperial intermediaries"" in encounters between indigenous peoples and imperial agents, garrisoned soldiers, and other migrants.

Analysis shows the skeletal sample to be demographically restricted, with 93.7% of the sample being 7-25 years old at the time of death. Additionally, the sample is predominantly female, with adult females outnumbering adult males by a margin of 3.2:1. High frequencies of linear enamel hypoplasias (73.2% of individuals) and low adult stature (female mean=153.3cm; male mean=160.8cm) suggest heavy stressor loads began early in life and were not ameliorated over time. Despite the overall young age of the sample, degenerative joint disease is prevalent, with 23.3% of individuals exhibiting DJD in a non-vertebral joint and 14.4% exhibiting bony change in the vertebral column. The youngest examples of DJD manifest in multiple 6-7 year old individuals. The presence of DJD in the occipital condyles (adults 22.5%; subadults 9.1%) and in the joints of the feet (adults 14.7%; subadults 5.5%) suggest carrying heavy loads, likely on the head, was a habitual activity. This interpretation is supported by high frequencies of spinal trauma, including compression fractures (adults 31.4%; subadults 15.6%), spondylolysis (adults 6.0%; subadults 2.5%), and Schmorl's nodes (adults 23.3%; subadults 4.1%).

16488,FA-232633-16,"Between the years 1439 and 1443, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester (1390-1447)—brother of Henry V and uncle of Henry VI, and often called England's first humanist—commissioned a Middle English verse translation of the Latin prose work *Opus agriculturae* by the Roman author Palladius Taurus Rutilius Aemilianus (late 4th—early 5th century CE), the most widely copied classical agricultural manual in the European Middle Ages. Of the Middle English poem known as *On Husbondrie*, however, only three manuscripts survive, and of these only one—the glorious presentation copy for the duke, which includes the use of multi-colored inks and gilding, Latin glosses, and a complex indexing system—is complete. In this essay, I attempt to account for this curious feat of Middle English literary and textual production by examining its representation of agriculture as affective labor and, conversely, its evocation of affect through the (versified) labor of farming. I argue that the most interesting effect of its form upon the content of the work re-presented in the text—that is, the principal result of rendering Palladius's prose agronomy into Middle English verse—is less a gain or loss of utility than it is a rather significant increase of emotive force, one that goes hand-in-hand with the affective technologies of the medieval manuscript book.

Narratives and representations of myriad texts, maps, objects, and images produced between 1450 and 1700 reveal a vision of a world where Mexico really was India, North America was an extension of China, South America was populated by a variety of biblical and Asian sites, and American cultural productions and ethnographic features colored conceptions of Asia. While the Amerasian imaginary was later suppressed by Eurocentric and colonialist narratives, here we consider various representations of Amerasia in order to bring it back into visibility. Doing so reveals various forms of mirroring at play, permitting us to understand one of the mechanisms by which Europeans assimilated a dizzying array of new knowledge to their pre-existing conceptual order, and also offering insights into early modern European conceptions of global geography and modernity.",Subscription,"Elizabeth Horodowich, Alexander Nagel",Journal,Journal of Early Modern HIstory,https://brill.com/view/journals/jemh/23/2-3/article-p257 6.xml,,Brill Publishers,,,"Amerasia: European Reflections of an Emergent World, 1492-ca. 1700",2019

Alongside Brooks, many authors promote similar views, especially Christians. I argue that Vodou does not negatively affect progress in Haiti. Rather, there are historical, linguistic, and governmental policies that limit progress. In reality, Vodou practitioners enhance progress in their attention to the planning and giving of ceremonies, in the hierarchical organization they establish in communities, in their ritual and language, and in the education imparted through inheritance, teaching, and initiation.

After discussing common folk beliefs about particular tree species, and examining associations between these species and individual spirits, I suggest that a rapid decrease of trees in Haiti mandated the ceremony for removing a spirit from a tree and placing it somewhere else. Consequently, as tree diversity dwindled into the handful of primary species utilized in rural Haiti today, a large pantheon of spirits had to be funneled into an increasingly limited number of trees.

16612,RZ-255604-17,"The Sicilian Channel between Sicily and North Africa receives global attention as a major migratory route for undocumented people entering Europe clandestinely, a tragic nexus of transnational displacement and desperation. While the plight of massively overloaded and unseaworthy boats of people justifiably receives the bulk of media attention, there is a less-observed movement that occurs and has occurred for thousands of years: small boats expertly transporting handfuls of people back and forth across the Channel between Tunisia and western Sicily. This study explores the material vestiges of cross-channel migrations through assemblages identified during fieldwork by the Arizona Sicily Project along the southwest coast of Sicily in the summers of 2018 and 2019. While the exigencies of maritime crossing require distinct technologies of mobility, certain elements of migrant material culture are analogous to that found elsewhere, e.g. along the US–Mexico border zone of Arizona's Sonoran Desert. Such elements include migrants' strategic triangulation of speed, invisibility and survival in deciding what to bring and the tactical triage of gear en route. Moreover, the political and economic injustices that are catalysts for the movements are comparable, as is the criminalization of the migrants, which has done more to endanger than dissuade them.

Preliminary analysis of structural and cultural materials recovered from an excavation on Mitrou, a small islet near the coastal village Tragana located 140 km north of Athens has established the site's contribution to a fuller understanding of settlement practices in Central Greece from the end of the Bronze Age through the Early Iron Age. The site's historic importance combined with its scenic coastal setting has considerable potential to be developed into an important tourist site. The physical geography of the region is the&#x0D; product of the complex interaction of coastal, alluvial, fluvial, and seismic processes. This investigation integrates the archaeological material with a geographical analysis employing a variety of geographical techniques (soil and sediment analysis, past climatic data, environmental surveys, and geospatial modeling) to reconstruct the geomorphological history of the site and to evaluate the area as a potential tourist site.",,M.D. Green,Journal,Applied Geography,,,,,,"A Geographical Analysis of the Atalanti Alluvial Plain and Coastline as the Location of a Potential Tourist Site, Bronze through Early Iron Age Mitrou, East-Central Greece",2011

2183,RA-50057-07,"This article examines interrelationships between environmental change and refugee displacement in North China's Henan province during the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945. Henan had a larger displaced population than any part of China during World War II, with most refugees migrating due to war-induced disasters that were the second-order effects of warfare. The Chinese Nationalist military's blasting of the Yellow River dikes to block a Japanese military advance in June 1938 displaced millions, forcing them to seek livelihoods in areas away from their home villages. In 1942-1943 Yellow River flooding combined with inclement weather conditions and heavy military grain exactions to create a famine of massive proportions in Henan, leading millions more residents to flee. The most severe ecological damage took place in areas of Henan that flood and famine refugees left, as labour shortages led to neglect and decline of human-constructed environments. Hydraulic infrastructure collapsed, agricultural cultivation came to a standstill and previously settled areas became desolate wastelands. Environmental degradation occurred on a more limited scale in areas of in-migration, as refugees heightened pressure on resources. In Shaanxi province, China's wartime state resettled refugees and mobilised them to reclaim land, leading to deforestation and accelerated soil erosion. The article engages with previous literature on the environmental consequences of refugee migration, questioning the notion that refugees have an unmediated impact on the environment. It is argued that refugee migration is impossible to isolate from other factors that lead to ecological damage in wartime settings.",Subscription,"Muscolino, Micah",Other,,http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/eh,Pay based database.,,,,"“Violence Against People and the Land: Refugees and the Environment in China’s Henan Province, 1938-1945.”",2011

Neither salonnière, apt subject for a pious memoir, nor transcendentalist, Emerson nonetheless eagerly surveyed their diverse conversational cultures in her unpublished ""Almanack"" manuscripts (c. 1804-55), which she routinely circulated within literary circles. This broad-minded desire to acquire and disperse knowledge uniquely enabled Emerson to influence different communities, connecting the cultures of eighteenth-century transatlantic women's coteries, salons, and generic conventions with nineteenth-century feminist and transcendentalist pursuits. Her rich foreground in coterie writing and such dialogic genres as commonplace books and memoirs distinctively facilitated Emerson's connection with the female transcendentalists who would ultimately benefit from the gendered and feminist self-consciousness of Fuller's more prominent conversational experiments—for Emerson began practicing self-cultivation and sharing it with others over thirty years before Fuller established these practices as central pedagogical tools in her Boston Conversations. Acting as a bridge between generations and in advance of the more feminist Fuller, Emerson experimented with diverse conversational media in order to achieve mutual cultivation, enlightened truth, and even professional opportunity.  &#x0D; ","Subscription ",Noelle Baker,Journal,ESQ: A Journal of the American Renaissance,http://libarts.wsu.edu/english/journals/esq/exaltadas.html,"A special issue of the journal ESQ, on A Female Genealogy of Transcendentalism","Washington State University, College of Liberal Arts, Department of English",,,“Let me do nothing smale”: Mary Moody Emerson and Women’s “Talking” Manuscripts,2011

Emerson kept an unpublished series of folded sheets bound with thread into ""fascicles,"" or booklets. For readers, the material features of these fascicles represent nonverbal but interactive ""conversation,"" in which Emerson places Almanack covers, intertextual ""parcels,"" and a recurring graphic sign in dialogue with verbal artistry. She thus shaped her manuscripts as ""visual productions"" for readers, gestures that scholars have primarily associated with the later and more richly performative writings of Emily Dickinson. The material features of the Almanacks reveal the self-consciously artistic aspects of Emerson's self-fashioning as a single woman, display the ways that they served their creator's incipient desire to engage with public history and culture, and evidence her belief in her own dialogic powers.

An analysis of the studies demonstrates the relationship between adoption research, child placement, and disability during this period.  That relationship was defined by attempts to ascertain the extent to which intelligence was hereditary not only for scientific theory but also for the purpose of placing children with the ""best"" permanent families. If the hereditary nature of intelligence and feeblemindedness could be definitively discerned by child scientists, then adoption agencies could avoid the unintentional placement of children with such disability in their family histories.&#x0D;  &#x0D; I suggest that both researchers' analysis of IQ in adoption research and agency use of IQ testing were intertwined with intense anxieties about intellectual disability and what it meant for adoptive family-building.  Agencies utilized mental testing in order to manage the risk of disability in placement and to reassure applicants that their constructed families would be on par with presumed able-bodied, natural ones. Looking at disability in adoption IQ studies and practice provides insight into the shifting notions of disability and family, their constructed and contingent nature, and the practical consequences of their conceptualization. &#x0D; ",article not yet published; submitted for publication August 2012,Sandy Sufian,Journal,Submitted to Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth.

To Open Access and Open Data advocates, the Web offers great opportunity for expanding the accessibility, scale, diversity, and quality of archaeological communications. Nevertheless, Open Access and Open Data face steep adoption barriers. Critics wrongfully see Open Access as a threat to peer review. Others see data transparency as naively technocratic, and lacking in an appreciation of archaeology's social and professional incentive structure. However, as argued in this paper, the Open Access and Open Data movements do not gloss over sustainability, quality and professional incentive concerns. Rather, these reform movements offer much needed and trenchant critiques of the Academy's many dysfunctions. These dysfunctions, ranging from the expectations of tenure and review committees to the structure of the academic publishing industry, go largely unknown and unremarked by most archaeologists.

From this perspective, one better understands how an elite can survive the demise of institutions that once protected it, the emergence of rival elites tapping into new sources of wealth, and even a revolutionary social movement.

Since academic institutions are a part of a greater power structure, these perceptions hold true when collecting and documenting history in grassroots communities as well.

There is, however, disagreement among some clinical psychologists and philosophers over whether a PTSD diagnosis further harms the victim. Clinical psychologists claim that focusing on a PTSD diagnosis risks undermining a victim's agency and subjectivity if therapists neglect the victim's own voice and experiences.  Philosophers who acknowledge PTSD in identifying the harm of sexual violence look to victims' experience of PTSD symptoms rather than how it is used in clinical practice.  They conclude that PTSD symptoms are compatible with agency and subjectivity insofar as they help illuminate what it is to be an agent and a subject.  I argue that the latter are too optimistic and the former are too pessimistic.  An examination of these conflicting views traces the disagreement to unacknowledged discipline-specific boundaries.

16816,AC-234283-16,"Global Mental Health (GMH) is a rapidly-growing movement supported by the World Health Organization that aims ""to improve treatments… and reduce human rights abuses of people experiencing mental disorders,"" particularly among the most vulnerable populations in the global South (Patel, et al. 2014, 3).  Because of GMH's reliance on Western psychiatry, this movement is criticized for engaging in a form of colonialization by imposing Western concepts and treatments of mental disorder on ""other"" cultures, often on the assumption that local cultural norms of disorder are inferior to the scientifically rigorous concepts of psychiatry. There is, therefore, a great need to reassess the moral principles that guide psychiatric interventions in non-western cultures. Yet bioethics as a profession has paid relatively little attention to mental health, much less to mental health in a global context.  In addition, the values of mainstream bioethics are the very values encoded in GMH and criticized by its opponents.  I argue that a bioethics for global mental health must avoid the twin horns of colonization and ethical relativism.  Proposed solutions from GMH and bioethics are on the right path by incorporating guidelines for culturally-sensitive treatment, but do not go far enough.  To make up for this, I utilize the framework of epistemic injustice, which identifies a fundamental harm that other solutions miss, and offers a solution for avoiding it.",Open Access,Zenon Culverhouse,Other,"In ""Global Bioethics and Human Rights""",,,Rowman &amp; Littlefield,,,A Bioethics for Global Mental Health.,2019

16864,FEL-262343-19,"This forthcoming paper examines the historical significance of the rebuilding of Laupahoehoe School, a Hawai‘i public school on the eastern coastline of Hawai‘i Island. The original school, along with major roads and infrastructure, was destroyed when an enormous tidal wave hit the island in April 1946. The destruction of the school came at a time (just after World War II) when Hawai‘i's population was growing rapidly, and older buildings were stretched to capacity with wartime children. Alfred Preis, a Jewish refugee architect from Nazi-occupied Vienna was selected to develop the Laupahoehoe design. Until 1946, Pries's work in Hawai‘i had remained closely wedded to the Austrian modernist form languages he had learned while studying in Vienna; he hadn't quite absorbed the ways in which design in the tropics could, or should, be different from architecture in temperate Europe. At Laupahoehoe, however, the post-disaster situation – which included impassable roads and serious difficulties importing building materials – forced Preis to improvise and to develop his skills as a tropical, regionalist architect. Preis used locally sourced materials, such as lava rock and ohia trees – a highly significant plant in indigenous tradition – and developed a passive climate control system derived from local wind patterns. He married these materials and techniques to his own Viennese traditions about ornament, and functional and spatial planning, creating a singularly regionalist building. At Laupahoehoe School, Preis thus put forward a new vision of tropical architecture for the islands – one that made modernism Hawaiian.",The proceedings will be open access when published,Laura McGuire,Journal,Proceedings of the 2019 Meeting of the International Network for Tropical Architecture,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVPBcYLySxMk1KDYbEG6ahhgHXKqFC3a/view?usp=sharing,"""Alfred Preis and Rebuilding Laupahoehoe School After a Tidal Wave: Making Modernism 'Hawaiian'"" By Laura McGuire   This is the final draft of my article accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 2019 Meeting of the International Network for Tropical Architecture.

16882,HAA-261070-18,"Recently, concerns have been raised over the potential impacts of commercial biases on editorial practices in biomedical publishing. Specifically, it has been suggested that commercial biases may make editors more open to publishing articles with author conflicts of interest (aCOI). Using a data set of 128,781 articles published in 159 journals, we evaluated the relationships among commercial publishing biases and reported author conflicts of interest. The 159 journals were grouped according to commercial biases (reprint services, advertising revenue, and ownership by a large commercial publishing firm). 30.6% (39,440) of articles were published in journals showing no evidence of commercial publishing biases. 33.9% (43,630) were published in journals accepting advertising and reprint fees; 31.7% (40,887) in journals owned by large publishing firms; 1.2% (1,589) in journals accepting reprint fees only; and 2.5 % (3,235) in journals accepting only advertising fees. Journals with commercial biases were more likely to publish articles with aCOI (9.2% (92/1000) vs. 6.4% (64/1000), p = 0.024). In the multivariate analysis, only a journal's acceptance of reprint fees served as a significant predictor (OR = 2.81 at 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6). Shared control estimation was used to evaluate the relationships between commercial publishing biases and aCOI frequency in total and by type. BCa-corrected mean difference effect sizes ranged from -1.0 to 6.1, and confirm findings indicating that accepting reprint fees may constitute the most significant commercial bias. The findings indicate that concerns over the influence of industry advertising in medical journals may be overstated, and that accepting fees for reprints may constitute the largest risk of bias for editorial decision-making.",CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0,"S.

16899,RA-50108-12,"This paper examines how the religious education of Turkish children in the ""old letters"" became an area of everyday contestation between the state and families and communities in the late 1920s and 1930s. Since children were seen as the nation's future, state authorities were adamant about teaching the new generation the new alphabet and were equally interested in preventing them from learning the old alphabet. While schools began using the new Turkish alphabet in the 1928–1929 academic year, the informal neighbourhood Qur'an courses held in mosques and private homes became a fiercely contested site between a state determined to socialise children into secular nationhood (partly) by preventing them from learning the Arabic letters, and families and imams who were committed to giving children religious education (necessitating the study of the Arabic alphabet so the Qur'an could be read in its original Arabic). Combining primary sources from previously untapped Ministry of the Interior documents concerning the monitoring in Anatolian towns of these informal courses with insights from the subaltern school on everyday forms of resistance, this article sheds light on a dimension of the 1928 alphabet reform that ties together questions of alphabet change, national and religious identities, education, and childhood.","on-line, pay wall",Hale Yilmaz,Journal,Paedagogica Historica:  International Journal of the History of Education,https://doi.org/10.1080/00309230.2019.1672764,Access to abstract via Taylor and Francis Online,Routledge,,,Between Turk and Muslim:  Children and the Qur’an Courses after the 1928 Alphabet Law,2019

16924,RA-259260-18,"Between 1704 and 1706, English Virginians destroyed the Nanziattico nation. First they used an oyer and terminer trial to hang several of its young men, and then they separated Nanziattico children from their parents and bound the children out as indentured servants. Finally, they sold the surviving Nanziattico adults in the English sugar island of Antigua. These events occurred at the brutal intersection of many colonial histories--Native dispossession and land seizure, native enslavement, the Atlantic slave trade, and the creation of archives that minimized colonial violence. In this way the story of the Nanziatticos is not merely a tale of the early eighteenth century; instead, it is rooted in the previous century of English colonialism in Virginia and in a long and dire history for Native people attempting to navigate the dangers of colonialism. The English removed the Nanziatticos in the service of two desires--control of land and the erasure of Native claims to Virginian spaces--thus underscoring that Native enslavement was not always about labor. Though historians generally present the trade in enslaved Native people in the Southeast either as the result of coordinated slave raids made by the English and their Native allies or as the result of diplomatic or trade encounters, in this case the English used their courts and the language of justice to dispossess and to enslave. In how they told (or did not tell) the story of the Nanziatticos, the English quietly eliminated an entire nation, an event seen only with difficulty in the archive.",open access,"Goetz, Rebecca Anne",Journal,Journal of Southern History,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/716196,journal's website,The Southern Historical Association,,,The Nanziatticos and the Violence of the Archive: Land and Native Enslavement in Colonial Virginia,2019
16925,RA-259260-18,"This article explores literary discussions of sovereignty in two medieval Scottish romances, John Barbour's The Bruce (c. 1375) and the anonymous Arthurian romance Golagros and Gawane (c. 1475), both of which respond to the Anglo-Scottish conflicts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and advocate Scottish independence. Premodern European conceptions of sovereignty relied on narratives of recognition to construct and support political claims. This essay argues that these Scottish vernacular texts adapted terms from the larger European discourse to re-imagine the nature of government and freedom through the formal element of a 'sovereign recognition'. While Barbour's The Bruce attempts to distinguish the validity of political claims via the rightful behavior of rulers, ultimately it remains trapped by the prevailing terms of sovereign recognition that require the subjugation of others and the citation of documentary 'proof' to establish authority. By contrast, Golagros and Gawane critiques the use of historical narratives of recognition in determining political relations. This Arthurian romance posits alternative criteria for sovereign recognition that would create a dialogic system of equivalent polities based on personal bonds of mutual acknowledgement. The political thought in both literary texts offers a valuable challenge to current definitions of sovereignty and freedom as located solely within the framework of the territorial nation-state.",open access,"Manion, Lee",Journal,Scottish Literary Review,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/741707,journal's website,Association for Scottish Literary Studies,,,Scottish Narratives of Sovereignty in the Later Middle Ages: Re-imagining 'Fredome',2019

This article examines animal transference and transformation among indigenous Wounaan in Panama. We use participant observation and analysis of stories to examine the transfer of virtuous animal (and other) properties to newborns via the navel (p'oo n?m, known in Spanish as ombligado), and the transformation of humans into animals as indicated in traditional stories. We demonstrate how and why these two animal–human interactions reveal human personhood—one augmenting and the other diminishing it. Rather than a ready mutability between human and animal realms of reality, we find transference and transformation intertwined with everyday relationality, morality, and constructional conviviality with animals as well as nonanimal beings.

Scholars and others made sound recordings, photographs, films, and drawings and recorded details of prisoners, this documentation now located in German archives.

Moreover, it looks searchingly at contemporary landscapes for traces and repression of this colonial history.

Settler colonialism is a tradition, and as such, it has habits. One of these habits is to hide specific tactics and practices in operationalizing dispossession. Attribution is one of these tactics. Attribution functions as a key mechanism within a copyright/author/archive matrix which maintains hierarchies of knowledge production by reducing Indigenous and non- European subjectivity and legitimating the ongoing appropriation of Indigenous1 cultural material by non-Indigenous authors. The colonial force of attribution and its practices of exclusion are hidden in the stacks and how they are populated; in the rights fields of databases and how they are cited; in archival processes of selection, appraisal, and accessioning; and through efforts to digitize content and collections in order to make them open without acknowledgment and ongoing relationships.

17020,RZ-51768-14,"This paper takes a holistic approach to the data for rural hinterlands in the Black Sea region in the fourth century BCE to reveal pan-Black Sea patterning, importantly including the southern coast and the territory of ancient Sinope. During a period of dynamic mobility and prosperity, the rural hinterlands of Greek settlements around the Black Sea expanded in ways that demonstrate significant regional commonalities in terms of increased settlement, intensified agricultural infrastructure, new connections via road and path networks and the inclusion of dependent territories beyond the traditional chora. Decisions to expand rural territory and intensify agricultural production were taken at the local level, but this patterning demonstrates that such developments were also a response to the dynamics of Black Sea economic and political networks. The associated increased density of occupation and connectivity in these rural hinterlands made them key facilitators of social networks, creating stronger ties between Greek settlements and other local communities, and ultimately enmeshing a more diverse group of people within Black Sea networks.",subscription,"Owen Doonan, Jane Rempel",Journal,Anatolian Studies,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anatolian-studies/,Journal page for Anatolian Studies,"Anatolian Studies, Cambridge University Press",https://www.academia.edu/42026678,Owen Doonan Academia.edu page,"Rural hinterlands in the Black Sea during the fourth century BCE: Expansion, intensification and new connections.",2020

In contrast to current mobile deflectometry systems, our method can capture surfaces with large normal variation and wide field of view (FoV). We achieve this by applying automated multi-view panoramic stitching algorithms to produce a large FoV normal map from a hand-guided capture process without the need for external tracking systems, like robot arms or fiducials. The presented work enables 3D surface measurements of specular objects 'in the wild' with a system accessible to users with little to no technical imaging experience.

2683,FA-55750-11,"Algeria occupies a special case within the context of modern Jewish history, as the only site in the colonial world in which autochthonous Jews were granted citizenship by a colonial power; with the passage of the Crémieux Decree in 1870, some forty years after the French conquest of Algeria began, roughly thirty thousand Jews became citizens of France in one of the only acts of mass naturalization to occur under modern European imperial rule. It is usually but a footnote to histories of Algerian Jewry that the Crémieux Decree did not, in fact, extend to all Algerian Jews.  At the time at which this law was passed, France had begun but not yet completed its bloody, fifty-year conquest of the Algerian Sahara, where several thousand Jews lived.  Algeria's Southern Territories (as they would come to be called in 1902) remained under direct military oversight for nearly eighty years of colonial rule, and Jewish residents of this administrative region, like the majority of Algerian Muslims, were categorized by the state as indigènes (indigenous subjects).  This paper reconstructs how colonial conquest, law, and policy sought to delineate southern Algerian Jewry from northern Algerian Jewry.  It argues that in the aftermath of the French conquest of the M'zab in 1882, the military sought to identify and legally isolate ‘southern Algerian Jewry' (first from ‘northern Algerian Jewry', and subsequently, from Algerian Muslims) for reasons that had nothing to do with Jews, per se; rather, in order to avoid jeopardizing a protectorate relationship it had built with the region's Ibadite leadership in 1853, to protect French strategic interests, and to maintain a fragile status quo.

2730,FO-50098-09,"While it is impossible to assign weights to the multitude of factors that have contributed to the crisis, flawed conceptual frameworks have played a substantial role.  For all the overwhelming complexity of the crisis, some fairly pedestrian policy errors were at the heart of the storm.  The U.S. financial authorities made the basic mistake that lies at the heart of most recent financial crises: they liberalized financial markets in the sense of giving market actors greater freedom to take risks without strengthening supervision to monitor this activity effectively and to contain the risk to the broader financial system.  In addition, they presumed that the most sophisticated investors, large financial institutions, should be allowed considerable freedom to take these risks because they were professionals with deep pockets, and because this activity would enhance the efficiency of financial markets overall.  They engaged in piecemeal deregulation, removing restrictions in one area of financial activity without fully considering the impact on other markets.  And they overestimated the capability of private sector actors – from rating agencies to self-regulatory organizations – to regulate in the public interest.  In short, they committed basic errors of market design.",,Steven Vogel,Journal,Socio-Economic Review,http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/3.toc,,,,,"“A Socio-Economic Perspective on the Financial Crisis""",2010

This ethnography explores what it means to legally account for Japanese imperialism decades after the original violence ended with Japan's defeat in World War II. Examination of recent compensation lawsuits filed by Chinese war victims against the Japanese government and corporations shows how legal interventions publicly reveal artificially separated, yet deeply intertwined moral and monetary economies that present postwar compensation as a question of the generational transfer of unaccounted-for pasts and accompanying debts. I elucidate how accounts and accounting address overdue responsibility for postwar generations and, against the background of generational shift and the changing balance of economic power between China and Japan, show how the crux of this issue has shifted from apology to inheritance and accountability.",,Yukiko KOGA,Journal,American Ethnologist,http://www.americanethnologist.org/,"The website for  American Ethnologist , the journal for the American Ethnological Society.",American Anthropological Association,,,"Accounting for Silence: Inheritance, Debt, and the Moral Economy of Legal Redress in China and Japan",2013

In the controversia, the most advanced exercise in the standard sequence of rhetorical pedagogy, students would deliver speeches on both sides of fictional law cases. Several of the controversiae involve scenarios of torture. Masters torture their slaves and then choose to report or withhold the testimony they extract thereby; or a tyrant who has usurped control of the community tortures free persons. In a small number of cases, an abusive father or the declamatory court itself subjects a free person to torture as part of punishment for a conviction. Not long after completing their training, some of the elite male students who practised declamation would present appeals before governors, courts, and public audiences. Others would become magistrates empowered to use torture as part of judicial quaestiones (investigations). By examining several controversiae that involve scenarios of torture, this article looks at how rhetorical education in the Roman imperial period guided elite male students to think critically about both the ethical and the pragmatic considerations involved in the employment of torture.",subscription journal available in print and online formats,"Bernstein, Neil W",Journal,"Greece and Rome ",http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8697095&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0017383512000058,publisher website,Cambridge University Press,,,"‘Torture her until she lies’: Torture, Testimony, and Social Status in  Roman Rhetorical Education",2012
2815,RA-50073-09,"Production commons require social maintenance or stewardship. Stewardship practices, meaning patterns of valuing and caring for cultural resources, often restrict or foster access to knowledge within or beyond a self-defined group. I term these two protective but seemingly oppositional strategies as ""sequestration"" and ""circulation,"" respectively. How can we account for individual and group differences in the willingness to share knowledge and techniques for producing cultural expressions? To answer this question, I employ ethnographic narratives, mainly drawn from producers of Indonesian textiles (with comparisons to carvers, musicians, dramatists, and dancers), to construct typologies of informal stewardship rationales and techniques. Examples of circulation and sequestration strategies provide contextual data about what sways artisans' cooperative or competitive behaviors in ""split economies."" This term refers to industries where expressive cultural productions serve both internal, embedded social purposes, contributing local cultural value mainly through delayed economic reciprocity, and external commodity markets. Untangling the economic, sociological, and identity boundary aspects of ""value"" helps clarify conundrums about when producers want to circulate versus sequester information. Sequestration strategies often protect inherited privileges or commercial market share of technically vulnerable industries.

Digital libraries pose two problems of scale not usually found in the article datasets used to test these algorithms. 1) Because libraries span several centuries, the genres being identified may change gradually across the time axis. 2) Because volumes are much longer than articles, they tend to be internally heterogeneous, and the classification task also requires segmentation.

Traditionally, such variants have been viewed as corruptions rather than evidence of use. Authors, well aware of these risks and opportunities, incorporated such instabilities into their own writing strategies, and used the unintended transformations of diffusion as a hypothetical safeguard for unorthodox arguments. This essay analyses the diffusion of Galileo's Copernican letters and tracts (1613–16).

3053,RA-50012-04,"Until 1530, sculptural images of Confucius and varying numbers of disciples and later followers received semiannual sacrifices in state-supported temples all over China. The icons' visual features were greatly influenced by the posthumous titles and ranks that emperors conferred on Confucius and his followers, the same as for deities in the Daoist and Buddhist pantheons. This convergence led to visual conflation and aroused objections from Neo-Confucian ritualists, culminating in the ritual reform of 1530, which replaced images with inscribed tablets and Confucius's kingly title with the designation Ultimate Sage and First Teacher. However, the ban on icons did not apply to the primordial temple of Confucius in Qufu, Shandong. Post-1530 gazetteers publicized the distinction by reproducing a line drawing of this temple's sculptural icon, and persistent replications of this image helped to popularize his cult. The same period saw a proliferation of non-godlike representations of Confucius, including his portrayal as a teacher, whose iconographic origins can be traced to a painted portrait handed down through generations of his descendants. In recent years, variations of this teacher image have become the basis for new sculptural representations, first in Taiwan, then in Hong Kong and the Chinese diaspora, and finally on the mainland.

Above all, these were shaped by the pedagogy of James Bryant Conant, who placed history at the heart of general science education. While Conant's expansive vision for history of science ultimately was not realized, its emphasis on experiential learning for non-scientists is worth revisiting for current integrative approaches to higher education.  A team of two historians and one biologist has done this by developing a teaching model that infuses the humanities into two general science education courses through history lectures integrated with science labs. We assessed the model's impact on learning outcomes, experiences, and attitudes toward science and history through a blind study of student participants. Our results showed that courses taught using the model significantly improved experiences and attitudes toward science among students who were initially less friendly toward science, and improved experiences and attitudes toward history among students who were initially less friendly toward history.",subscription only,"David Brandon Dennis, Ph.D., R.A.

It finds that in contrast to the European preference for hand metaphors in the genre terms – enchiridions, manuals, and handbooks – the Chinese medical archive preserves bodily metaphors within which the hand metaphor appears only rarely in the early medieval period and is then superseded by metaphors that rely on the fingers and palms more than the hands per se. This long-durée survey from roughly the fourth to fourteenth centuries of the wide-ranging metaphors for ‘handy medical books' places their historical emergence and transformation within the history of Chinese medical manuscripts and printed texts. Metaphors in medical titles conveyed to potential readers at the time significant textual innovations in how medical knowledge would be presented to them. For later historians, they provide evidence of profound changes in managing an increasingly complex and expanding archive of Chinese medical manuscripts and printed texts.

Archaeologists typically rely upon ceramics to assign associated materials to the broadly defined Patayan I, II, and III periods. However, as data amass, it is becoming increasingly clear that the established date ranges for certain types of Patayan pottery tied to those periods are inaccurate, and that the overall chronology may benefit from revision. Consequently, there are renewed calls to reassess the ceramic typologies and identify attributes with utility for dating affiliated archaeological phenomena. Here I focus on one such attribute, the stucco surface treatment on Lower Colorado Buff Ware. While the prevailing typology regards stucco as diagnostic of the Patayan II and III periods (circa AD 1000–1900), I present data that show stucco is conspicuously absent from contexts dating before AD 1400 but is rather common thereafter. I conclude Lowland Patayan potters began applying stucco to their wares between 1400 and 1600, and this attribute is therefore useful for dating associated material to a narrower AD 1400–1900 timeframe.",subscription only,Aaron M.

Samama v. Samama was a fabulously complicated case that dragged on in Italian courts for almost a decade. The crux of the legal arguments concerned the nationality of Nissim Samama, a Jew born in Tunis; Samama's nationality, in turn, would determine which legal system regulated his estate. The Italian Civil Code enshrined respect for the national law of a foreigner, but such foreigners were presumed to be Western. A case involving the national law of Tunisia and the status of Jews called the very foundations of the international legal system into question. In putting Samama's nationality on trial, the case opened up debate over fissures in the emerging theory of international law: How could non-Western states like Tunisia fit into an international legal order? How did Islamic law intersect with international law? What was the status of Jewish nationhood in a world increasingly based on exclusive nationalities? The Samama case offers access to the voices of European international lawyers debating the ambiguities of their field, as well as those of Maghrebis articulating their own vision of international law.

In the diplomatic realm, late Ottoman-British tussles were not limited to disputes over Ottoman territories and populations, but extended to Ottoman interventions in British domains as well. Utilizing archival and museum collections from Istanbul, New Delhi,New England, and Ottawa, this article contributes to a growing literature on late Ottoman extraterritoriality by probing Istanbul's diplomatic and consular activities within two very different and distant British territories: India and Canada. First, the study examines discord between Istanbul and London over a seemingly innocuous yet increasingly sensitive issue: the Ottoman sultan-caliph's conferral of honorary medals upon Indian Muslim notables. Second, the article pivots to the western hemisphere to explore Ottoman consular interventions surrounding the estates of Ottoman subjects who died in Canada. By considering examples of Ottoman‘soft power' in two far-flung regions of the world, the study contests one-dimensional narratives of extraterritoriality that fixate on European interventions in the Ottoman domains, or frame the Ottomans as passive spectators resigned to Western superiority in the Middle East, eastern Mediterranean, or other conventional geographies associated with Ottoman history.",open access,Faiz Ahmed,Journal,The International History Review,https://doi.org/10.1080/07075332.2020.1731567,The International History Review access,Taylor &amp; Francis,,,"Meddling with Medals, Defending the Dead:  Late Ottoman Soft Power from South Asia to North America",2020

It is located in Tunde (Tib. Ras phag) Village along the Chandrabhaga River valley in Himachal Pradesh, on the periphery of the Western Himalayan Buddhist horizon. The Drukpa Kagyu monk Taktsang Repa (Stag tshang ras pa,1574-1651)visited it in the seventeenth century, and the account of his pilgrimage to what he seems to have assumed was U??iyana, attracted the attention of Giuseppe Tucci.

In recent years, a Buddhist monk and a Hindu pujari are deputed to assist both types of visitors. Another alluring issue is that a temple with a sikhara in the Nagara style usually associated with north Indian Brahmanical architecture houses a Buddhist sculpture, and that too carved in white marble, a highly unusual material in Himalayan Buddhism. No overwhelming consensus has been arrived at about either the date of the temple, or the sculpture installed within it, or whether the architecture was ""originally"" Brahmanical and then adapted to house a Buddhist image, or was Buddhist from start. Rather than taking up those well-rehearsed if unresolved matters, here I focus on the iconography of the image in question, Sugatisa?darsana Lokesvara, its association with Kashmir, and the appearance in neighboring Zangskar of images that appear to be copies of the particular white marble sculpture now in Triloknath.",,Robert Linrothe,Journal,Journal of Tibetology,https://www.academia.edu/43037933/Art Historical Evidence for a Cult of the Trilokn%C4%81th Lokesvara in Zangskar,academia.edu site,,,,Art Historical Evidence for a Cult of the Triloknath Lokesvara in Zangskar,2019

The artifact assemblage includes iron and cast iron objects recovered during the recent Mongol-American joint expedition to sites in the eastern part of Mongolia. Cast iron objects, dominating the assemblage, were mostly in the form of small fragments or square bars, which would be of little value if they were to be used for casting. However, their greatly varying microstructures reveal evidence of various small-scale steelmaking processes involving cast iron. This observation suggests that most of them were prepared as a practical means to procure steel, a highly valued commodity particularly among nomadic communities.

17730,RZ-249831-16,"Evidence of novel steel-making was found in a number of small cast-iron fragments recovered by the Mongolia–American archaeological survey of eastern Mongolia. These iron artefacts come from medieval period habitation and manufacturing sites and they consistently display irregular surface features characteristic of a solidification reaction from a partially molten state. Their microstructure consists of large near-spherical islands of pearlite spread on a background of fine white cast-iron eutectic. Reflected in this peculiar structure is an extremely small-scale steel-making process where one or more small pieces of cast iron were heated above the eutectic temperature for rapid decarburization in the partially molten state. We provide a detailed account of the technological aspects of this micro-scale steel-making method as observed in the microstructure and chemical composition of the objects examined. This small-scale technology was ideally suited to the pastoral nomadic way of life that characterized medieval eastern Mongolia; however, it probably would not have been appropriate for sedentary communities with access to large-scale urban manufacturing centres. Based on this observation, we discuss the role of nomadic lifeways and associated political environments that likely influenced the development of this innovative steel-making technique.",,"Park, J, Honeychurch, W, Amartuvshin, Ch",Journal,"Archaeometry 61, 1:83–98",,,,,,Novel Micro-scale Steel-making from Molten Cast Iron Practised in Medieval Nomadic Communities of East Mongolia,2019

By examining her ideas on these issues and on women's legal rights as they appeared in her journal,Resimli Ay, the paper shows how Sertel analytically linked women's economic dependence with ideologies of sexual honor that limited and controlled access to women's sexuality. This led her to identify the origins of prostitution as economic, to oppose the licensing of brothels and the regulation of prostitutes by the state, to advocate the entrance of women into the labor force, and to inveigh against the legal and social exclusion of women from many areas of commercial activity.

3097,RA-20216-00,"Given the influence of these views with respect to beauty pageants, it can come as rather a shock to look at Turkish newspapers from the late twenties and early thirties and come across page after page of headline coverage of a beauty contest presented as part of a radical repositioning of women in society—to see beauty pageants used as tools of women's emancipation and modernization. Yet, in a society where women historically had been segregated from men not of their immediate family and carefully preserved from the gaze of outsiders, where family honor was understood to reside in the family's women, and where ""fallen"" women were sometimes killed to regain that lost honor, the ability to show one's physical self in a public forum without fear of harm or dishonor was deeply radical. It must have been liberating, even though the introduction of women into public space and public life was undertaken to serve ends other than the development of each woman's autonomy, and despite the fact that it entailed an objectification of the women in question. To put it another way, beauty pageants or contests in Turkey represented a profound alteration of the rules of the game. They did not get rid of notions of good and bad women, gender roles, or family honor, but the transformations with which beauty contests were associated changed the parameters of where women could go and what they could do without being understood as ""fair game."" In fact, they represented a redefinition of the concept of respectability or honor, namus, and an expansion for women of the limits of the social contract.

3100,RA-20216-00,"Skull removal and the modelling of facial features on dry human skulls occurred in central Anatolia during the late Neolithic period (ca. 6000–5000?BC) at the site of Kösk Höyük. This paper describes significant new evidence for plastered and undecorated skulls from Kösk Höyük that is inconsistent with prior interpretations of these remains as that of an ancestor cult. Rather, this new evidence strongly suggests a funerary ritual in the Near East that focused on the skulls of males, females and children. It also highlights the need for continued bioarchaeological research on such skulls. This paper describes newly discovered plastered skulls and skulls that were cached but not necessarily decorated from Kösk Höyük, Turkey. It provides the archaeological context, visual description, and osteological analysis of the remains of 12 adult skulls, ten modelled and two plain. In addition, a plastered child's skull was reported in the past. A bioarchaeological study of the primary material indicates that the skulls of males and females were removed from their bodies after natural decomposition, without manual defleshing, followed by applications of plaster modelling. The skulls of both sexes and all ages were modelled in a similar manner, although crania of three females exhibited healed depressed fractures. Plastered skulls from Kösk Höyük were recovered along with funerary offerings of beads, bone tools, and possibly copper, and derived from a variety of intramural contexts.",subscription,Michelle Bonogofsky,Journal,International Journal of Osteoarchaeology,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oa.749/abstract,journal access,,,,A Bioarchaeological Study of Plastered Skulls From Anatolia:  New Discoveries and Interpretations,2005

3110,RA-50078-09,"Until the eleventh century, Islamic religious scholars had a cool attitude toward philosophy and Aristotelian logic. They considered the first as the reflection on issues related to religion on the basis of pure reason, and the second as its method.  The point of departure for scholars was the scriptural texts, the Qur'an and Hadith (reports of the prophetic tradition). Thus, usul al-fiqh (theoretical jurisprudence) and other religious disciplines developed while having only a minimal relationship to the philosophical tradition and Aristotelian logic.  However, after the eleventh century when philosophy and religious studies became mature, these two strands of knowledge interacted to such a degree that the distinction between them was gradually blurred.  Those with a philosophical inclination adopted scholars' major assumptions and produced works that could be considered a contribution to a particular religious discipline. Meanwhile, religious scholars studied and cited the works of philosophers, especially Ibn Sina (d. 1037), and also adopted their discursive language, concepts, proofs, themes, and methods.&#x0D; In this essay, Atcil explores an aspect of the interaction by examining the conceptions of Islamic jurisprudence by scholars who lived in the Ottoman central lands from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. I contend that following and developing the approach of several Muslim theoreticians, they adopted Aristotle's theory of sciences and presented Islamic jurisprudence as a science withthe standards of this theory.

3114,RA-50079-09,"In ""'Having Many Wives' in Two American Rebellions: The Politics of Households and the Radically Conservative,"" Sarah M. S. Pearsall examines households and in particular plural unions in the context of two rebellions in the far north of New Spain: the Guale Rebellion of 1597 and the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Before exploring these familial and sexual arrangements, she considers the novel meanings of polygamy in Old and New Spain. For many Spaniards, polygamy represented resistance to Christianity, apostasy, desecration, political subversion, and violence among the indigenous population. For many Native Americans, however, it indicated masculine status and authority, as well as positive notions of labor organization, hierarchy, and political confederation. Revisiting textual evidence in conjunction with archaeological findings, Pearsall explores how and why transformations of households and gender roles occurred. Too often, she argues, scholars have been beguiled by calls for tradition, such as those heard in the Pueblo Revolt, thus failing to appreciate the transformative possibilities inherent in such appeals. Far from implying a return to precolonial ways, the rebels' schemes had the potential to effect a profound alteration in existing Pueblo cultures, especially in terms of gender. It is possible to trace how, in some contexts, both men and women made ""radically conservative"" choices, connecting themselves consciously to the past in innovative ways.",Subscription Only,Sarah Pearsall,Journal,The American Historical Review,http://www.worldcat.org/title/having-many-wives-in-two-american-rebellions-the-politics-of-households-and-the-radically-conservative/oclc/5165962755&amp;referer=brief results,,American Historical Association,,,'Having Many Wives' in Two American Rebellions: The Politics of Households and the Radically Conservative,2013

Although both histories of family and histories of the Atlantic world have provoked considerable scholarly debate about the analytical coherence and utility of these terms, putting them together offers an important and fresh view of each. Certainly families were affected by economic, political, or cultural structures of many kinds, but they made choices and pursued strategies that, in thousands or tens of thousands of repetitions, shaped those same patterns. That is, their decisions, described as familial or made in the context of family relations, constituted micropolitics and microeconomics that cumulatively comprised critical elements in configuring the Atlantic world. Looking to Atlantic contexts also heightens our appreciation of the internal dynamics of family, in which those same decisions could be made by individuals either with or against collective family interests. And it asks us to attend to the definitions of family employed by the most interested parties, the people themselves, but also by external authorities who found the exploitation and regulation of family a critical instrument of imperial and other Atlantic powers.",Subscription Only,"Sarah Pearsall, Julie Hardwick, Karin Wulf",Journal,William and Mary Quarterly,https://oieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Apr13/abstracts.html,,Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture,,,"Introduction: Centering Families in Atlantic Worlds, 1500-1800",2013

The review suggests that attending to voice in its multiple registers gives particular insight into the intimate, affective, and material/embodied dimensions of cultural life and sociopolitical identity.

Historians have tended to view these conflicts as evidence of Calvinist rigidity and the incompatibility between Protestantism and non-European societies.

Many Calvinists on the missionary frontier, like their Catholic counterparts, opted for syncretistic strategies over objections from authorities in their religious heartland.",,Charles Parker,Journal,"Journal of Global History, Volume 8",,,,,,Converting souls across cultural borders: Dutch Calvinism and early modern missionary enterprises,2013

Exiled from France after 1792, Villers intervened in important French and German debates about the relationship of religion, history, and philosophy. The article shows how he took up a German Protestant discussion on the meaning of the Reformation that had been underway from the 1770s through the end of the century, including efforts by Kantians to seize the mantle of Protestantism for themselves. Villers's essay capitalized on a broad interest in the question of Protestantism and its meaning for modern freedom around 1800. Revisiting the formation of the narrative of Protestantism and progress reveals that it was not a logical progression from Protestant theology or religion but rather part of a specific ideological and social struggle in the wake of the French Revolution and the collapse of the Old Regime.",Subscription,Michael Printy,Journal,Modern Intellectual History,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1479244312000054,Journal's website; subscription only,,"http://works.bepress.com/michael printy/3 ",Copy of article available at institutional repository,Protestantism and Progress in the Year XII: Charles Villers' Essay on the Spirit and Influence of Luther's Reformation (1804),2012

3222,FA-55502-10,"In discussing family law in countries with Muslim majority populations, a fundamental point to underscore is that Islamic ideals and practices took different forms in different places in the course of history despite a common theology. I find it useful to think of Islam as an ‘umbrella identity', an idiom of cultural unity that goes together with considerable variations according to time and place. Islam has intermingled with many other factors such as local customs, politics, socioeconomic structures and historical conjuncture to shape the interpretation of family law in various ways, depending on time and circumstances. Islamic family law has been at the core of the Islamic tradition. Defining the rights and obligations of men and women in the family and, by extension, in the community and society at large, Islamic law regulates marriage, divorce, custody of children and inheritance rights. These issues matter a great deal for the stability of families and the well-being of individuals.

3223,FA-55502-10,"The Arab Spring has inaugurated a new form of politics that represents a&#x0D; shift from a ‘politics from above' to a ‘politics from below' in regard to gender policy in Tunisia. Discourse surrounding state policy on gender, formerly the purview of elite groups, has recently been shaped and driven by popular organizations and associations. This article draws on Habermas to argue that the shift has been facilitated by the emergence of a new public sphere and engaged civil society following the fall of the Zine El Abidine Ben Ali regime in 2011. To demonstrate the emergence and diversity of Tunisian civil society, we focus on the promulgation of a new constitution and the debate surrounding Article 28, which has been contested by some Tunisians as reducing women's status to ‘complementary.' A discussion of women's status in the history of Tunisian family law, especially in the popularly valorized Code of Personal Status, illustrates how women's rights were historically expanded as a top down policy or ‘politics from above.' We juxtapose this historical context with the present period of transition and constitution writing since 2011.  An examination of quotations from Tunisian women, both opponents and supporters of Article 28, demonstrates the shift in Tunisia from a ‘politics from above' to a ‘politics from below' as women's groups are making demands upon the state and voicing their concerns in ways that have profoundly influenced the tenor of debates around gender politics in the country.",,"Mounira M.

It argues that despite their lack of official lawmaking power, Arabs and Jews succeeded in decisively shaping the course taken by water law in this period. After surveying the Ottoman water law in force when the British took power in 1917, the article examines influential court decisions in a case brought by the Arab residents of the village Artas against government expropriation of water, and explains the significance of this litigation for the subsequent development of Palestine's water law. It then discusses British initiatives meant to reform water law and subject the country's water to state control, plans frustrated by the opposition of Zionist groups fearful of increased government regulation. It closes by noting that water law was made in this colonial context neither by imposition from above nor by resistance from below, but by intervention of subject peoples at the highest levels of official lawmaking.",Subscription,David Schorr,Journal,Water History,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12685-014-0103-9,"Water History, September 2014, Volume 6, Issue 3, pp 247-263",Springer,,,Water Law in British-ruled Palestine,2014

3224,FA-55502-10,"Women have been central to the events that have shaken Tunisian politics since&#x0D; the Arab Spring in 2010-11. They have played roles as protesters and politicians, activists and academics, journalists and photographers, and whether poor or privileged, urban or rural. Tunisia has long occupied an important position in the Arab world since the historic promulgation of its progressive family law in 1956, which placed the country at the forefront of the Arab world in regard to women's rights (Charrad 2007). In an extensive comparative survey of Arab countries in 2009, Freedom House ranked Tunisia first in the major categories that concern women's rights, including ""autonomy, security, and freedom of person,"" and ""political and civic voice,"" (Kerry &amp; Breslin 2010).&#x0D; In this article, we address two related questions. In the first section, we consider&#x0D; how Tunisia came to occupy a premier position in regard to women's rights through the promulgation of its Code of Personal Status (CPS) in 1956, well known throughout the Arab world, and the continuous amendments to the CPS over a half-century since then. In the second section, we discuss some of the current debates on women's rights in Tunisia following the Arab Spring, including the mobilization of women around the controversial Article 28 in the draft of the new constitution. By ""women's rights,"" we mean women's rights in the law as it concerns personal status and family law. We focus on this aspect of the law because family law is, as lawyer and human rights activist Asma Khadar (1996: 2) stated unambiguously, ""the gate of freedom and human rights for women"" in the Arab&#x0D; and broader Muslim worlds. Family law has significant implications for women's lives, including their ability to make life choices freely and to pursue educational and professional opportunities.",Open access,"Mounira M.

This essay focuses on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to explore the significance of slumming in the creation and reception of 1960s rock. Lower East Side rock musicians drew little overt influence from their neighborhood's longstanding ethnic communities, which included eastern Europeans, Puerto Ricans, and African Americans. Rather, these musicians were fascinated with the concept of the ""slum"" itself as a more abstract signifier of authenticity, adventure, and nonconformity.  I propose that a ""slum aesthetic"" emphasizing dirt, obscenity, and willful amateurism, exemplified by local band the Fugs, was crucial to the Lower East Side rock scene.  Examining this ""slum aesthetic"" helps paint a more nuanced picture of both the political significance of rock and the connections between popular music and urban life.  As the Lower East Side's musicians aspired to resist the repression and materialism of the U.S. mainstream, they represented their marginalized neighborhood in ways that combined thoughtful engagement with broad caricature, a contradiction that spurred both social tension and musical creativity.",subscription,Patrick Burke,Journal,Journal of the Society for American Music,http:// [forthcoming Fall 2014],,Cambridge University Press,,,"The Fugs, The Lower East Side, and the Slum Aesthetic in 1960s Rock",2014

This targeted approach in the Balkans differs in critical ways from the rhetoric of the United States and their partners in Europe and Turkey, which promote idealized notions of diversity, pluralism, and tolerance through a mosaic of heritage projects (Islamic, Jewish, Christian, museum displays, archaeological research, etc.). The Ambassadors Fund projects are staged in moral terms as part of reconciliation and EU integration.

17731,RZ-249831-16,"Technological innovation often occurs in unexpected places far from the origin of pertinent invention. This may be prompted by a range of factors including constrained access to human, material, or informational resources as might be expected during periods of political change and uncertainty. Such experiments in both technique and technology can be a useful way to promote multiple options and flexibility in production, especially given shifting sociopolitical settings. A clear example of this case was observed based on cast iron fragments recovered from several medieval period sites within the Delgerkhaan Uul area of eastern Mongolia. These fragments were consistently small in size and mostly irregular in shape, suggesting no specific usage of practical value in the local steppe environment. However, results from visual, microstructural, compositional, and radiocarbon analyses produced strong evidence that cast iron objects, both of medieval and earlier periods, were collected to serve as a raw material for further treatments evidently in small-scale steelmaking processes. While the production of small amounts of high-quality steel was the end goal of these treatments, significant differences visible in microstructures indicate that the process was not standardized and subject to substantial variation. These results suggest a technological environment characterized by the use of non-local cast iron materials subjected to micro-steelmaking under non-standardized processing conditions. We interpret this unique technology as an example of nomadic steppe communities innovating within the constraints of their local geographical, technological, and sociopolitical setting to maintain flexible alternatives during a period of sociopolitical transformation and uncertainty.",,"Park, J, Honeychurch, W, Amartuvshin, Ch",Journal,Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences. doi.org/10.1007/s12520-020-01030-4.,,,,,,Technologies and complexities as reflected in small cast iron fragments recovered from medieval sites in eastern Mongolia,2020

Built by either the Liao or Jin Dynasties, the wall features numerous auxiliary structures that hint at its function.

17734,RZ-249831-16,"This paper focuses on a hitherto little-known long (or ""Great"") wall that stretches along 737 km from northern Inner Mongolia in China, through Siberia into northeastern Mongolia. The wall was constructed during the late medieval period (10th to 13th century CE) but is commonly called the ""Wall of Chinggis Khan"" (or ‘Chingisiin Dalan' in Mongolian). It includes, in addition to the long-wall itself, a ditch feature and numerous associated fortifications. By way of an analysis of this impressive construction we seek to better understand the concept of monumentality and in turn shed light on the wall's structure, function and possible reasons for its erection. We pose the interesting question of whether any construction that is very large and labor intensive should be defined as a ""monument"", and if so, what that definition of monumentality actually entails and whether such a concept is useful as a tool for research. Our discussion is relevant to the theme of this collection of papers in that it addresses the concept of the ‘extraordinary' as conceived by archeologists. Following our analysis and discussion, we conclude that although size and expenditure of energy are important attributes of many monuments, monumentality (i.e., expression of the extraordinary) is not a binary ""either-or"" concept. Rather than ask whether the ""Wall of Chinggis Khan"" was or was not a monument per se, our analysis reveals aspects in which it was indeed monumental and extraordinary, and others in which it was not extraordinary, but rather an ordinary utilitarian artifact.",,"Shelach, G, Honeychurch, W, Amartuvshin, Ch",Journal,Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications. doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-0524-2.,,,,,,Does extra-large equal extra-ordinary?

17762,HAA-261070-18,"Recently, concerns have been raised over the potential impacts of commercial relationships on editorial practices in biomedical publishing. Specifically, it has been suggested that certain commercial relationships may make editors more open to publishing articles with author conflicts of interest (aCOI). Using a data set of 128,781 articles published in 159 journals, we evaluated the relationships among commercial publishing practices and reported author conflicts of interest. The 159 journals were grouped according to commercial biases (reprint services, advertising revenue, and ownership by a large commercial publishing firm). 30.6% (39,440) of articles were published in journals showing no evidence of evaluated commercial publishing relationships. 33.9% (43,630) were published in journals accepting advertising and reprint fees; 31.7% (40,887) in journals owned by large publishing firms; 1.2% (1,589) in journals accepting reprint fees only; and 2.5% (3,235) in journals accepting only advertising fees. Journals with commercial relationships were more likely to publish articles with aCOI (9.2% (92/1000) vs. 6.4% (64/1000), p = 0.024). In the multivariate analysis, only a journal's acceptance of reprint fees served as a significant predictor (OR = 2.81 at 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6). Shared control estimation was used to evaluate the relationships between commercial publishing practices and aCOI frequency in total and by type. BCa-corrected mean difference effect sizes ranged from -1.0 to 6.1, and confirm findings indicating that accepting reprint fees may constitute the most significant commercial bias. The findings indicate that concerns over the influence of industry advertising in medical journals may be overstated, and that accepting fees for reprints may constitute the largest risk of bias for editorial decision-making.",Open access,"S.

While new technologies have made generating high-quality and even dynamic network visualizations relatively easy, key challenges remain for humanities researchers. Many common objects of humanistic inquiry, such as aesthetic, historiographic, and biographical texts are often not easily transformed into the kinds of data structures necessary for network visualization. The Transparency to Visibility (T2V) Project was initiated to develop new methods and toolkits that can support humanistic researchers who need to extract relationship data from unstructured texts to support network visualization. The T2V team used bioethics accountability statements to pilot and evaluate different methods for extracting relationship data.

Although there are substantial overlaps among these categories, we approach each of them separately so as to better enable us to link our analyses to some of the key questions and concerns about what contemporary television has become and how it should best be studied. By inserting Hulu into a conversation about today's television ecosystem – a context from which it has been absent for too long – we purposefully broaden scholarly debates about SVOD platforms beyond that of Netflix and Amazon to reconsider some of the emergent conventions or common-sense norms that currently underpin our understanding of television in the Internet era. In the end, we argue streaming television is a multi-sited, quasi-iterative, and rapidly evolving marketplace, in which legacy practices persist alongside and often in competition with new modes of production, dissemination, and consumption.",,"Greg Steirer, Kevin Sanson",Journal,"Media, Culture, and Society",http://doi.org/ 10.1177/0163443718823144.,,,,,"Hulu, Streaming, and the Contemporary Television Ecosystem",2019
17813,FT-259489-18,"In 1932 the Jesuit missionaries in Alaska sponsored the creation of the Sisters of Our Lady of the Snows, a sisterhood of Native women religious. By most accounts the women were good and effective sisters: they taught the catechism and English to fellow Alaskan Natives, clergy with whom they labored admired their work ethic, and their convent house diaries reflect a dedication to their vows and their community. However, in 1945 the Jesuit Vicar Apostolic for Alaska suppressed the sisterhood. The Jesuit leadership cited financial concerns and poor health in their decision, but it was more complicated. This article first narrates the efforts to establish and sustain an indigenous sisterhood in Alaska and then recounts the obstacles faced by the sisters and their supporters. These obstacles were multilayered, related to race, gender, and logistics; additionally, these obstacles reveal the unique challenges of the Alaskan mission field. Unfortunately, these challenges kept the SOS from having a real chance to succeed. In this way, the story of the SOS mirrors much of the history of women religious in the United States but refracts that image through additional lenses of race and the colonial frontier.",,Emily Suzanne Clark,Journal,American Catholic Studies,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/766309,Database subscription page for article,American Catholic Historical Society,,,"The Sisters of Our Lady of the Snows: An Indigenous, Alaskan Sisterhood",2020

Rich and diverse as it is, it is beset by numerous problems that have rendered it fragile and often inaccessible. The situation is such that many sites are unsigned. Others are very difficult to get to. And even others – ones that are more easily located – have erratic hours, essentially locking out the average visitor to Sicily unless s/he is willing to invest the time and have the language skills necessary to persuade residents in the surrounding area to get the access keys.  Given these challenges, we are developing The Norman Sicily Project to document the cultural heritage of medieval Sicily during its Norman period (in other words, c. 1061–1194) so that a wide audience can learn about what was once there and what still remains. The site attempts to reconstruct what we know about the society by bringing together images, basic identifying information, geolocation data and, in some cases, videos, using modern web development techniques. It also offers genealogical information and visualization tools that can help visitors understand the data in new ways as well as sustainability data related to the monuments' physical states.

17852,FEL-262293-19,"Henry Box Brown was a fugitive US slave who, in 1849, mailed himself from slavery in Virginia to freedom in Philadelphia in a large postal crate. Brown survived and went on to perform panoramas of his experience and stage shows involving magic, mesmerism (hypnosis), phrenology, and even dark seances in the US, the UK, and Canada. In 1857 in England, he also acted in semi-autobiographical plays written specifically for him by the minor British playwright E. G. Burton. The author of this essay has now recovered and transcribed these plays. By comparing these plays to other British drama in this period about slavery, the article argues that they are important in staging a Black, heroic figure who survives enslavement and arrives to freedom. Secondly, and more theoretically, the article contends that Brown's performances in these dramas enact a challenging mode of performative fugitivity—of ‘running up against' slavery and social death—and depict the enslaved obtaining a resistant mode of visuality. Brown therefore can be viewed as a radical performance artist who manipulates his own objectification to create a powerful multivalent onstage persona that cannot be precisely caught within a viewer's ethnographic gaze.",Subscription,Martha J.

While the Eleatic heritage and themes in the dialogue are clear, it is less clear what the point would be of alluding to a well-known sophist. I suggest that the answer has to do with the similarities in the underlying methods employed by both Plato and Gorgias. These similarities, as well as Plato's recognition of them, suggest that he owes a more significant philosophical and methodological debt to sophists like Gorgias than is often assumed. Further evidence from Plato and Xenophon suggest that Socrates used this very same method, which I call ‘exploring both sides'. I distinguish this Socratic method and its sophistic counterpart in terms of structure, internal aim, and external aim.

17946,FT-255079-17,"In April of 1936, Governor Edwin ""Big Ed"" Johnson of Colorado declared martial law in a one-mile strip along the state's southern border with New Mexico, claiming that an invasion of ""aliens and indigents"" threatened the well-being of Colorado and its citizens. In addition to literally placing a militarized boundary between the more Anglo state of Colorado and the heavily Hispanic state of New Mexico, Johnson's blockade also heightened contestations over the social boundary between who belonged and who fell outside of citizen- ship and belonging. Those crossing the New Mexico–Colorado border for work included Mexican immigrants as well as New Mexican Hispanics who were long-time US citizens, most of whom were racialized as undesirable foreigners by many Anglo residents. Interestingly, during the blockade, many native-born Hispanics in New Mexico and Colorado also characterized Mexican immigrants in a negative light, while simultaneously and vigorously asserting their belonging as Spanish American citizens of the United States. The scholarly literature on the racialization of Hispanics has generally approached Mexican-origin people as a unitary group, explored their racial identity in contrast to Anglos, and, less often, taken into account tensions over racialization as they played out between different Hispanic groups. In response, this article details how Johnson's blockade contributed to the racialization—by both Anglos and Hispanics—of Mexican immigrants and Hispanics in the Southwest during the New Deal Era. This case study also offers a rare example of a state's attempt to usurp the federal government's plenary power over immigration during the twentieth century, a time when the federal government's control over immigration was relatively unquestioned.",,Monica W.

18004,FEL-262343-19,"Alfred Preis (1911-1993), who was a Viennese émigré and refugee architect with no early experience designing for tropical climates, went on to become one of the most prolific midcentury regionalist and modernist Hawai‘i designers. Although he is best known for his award-winning design for the USS Arizona Memorial (1962) – one of the ships infamously sunk in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Pries's earlier institutional and residential commissions are arguably his most compelling. His Viennese roots directly influenced Pries's approach to design in Hawai‘i. By engaging numerous precedents from Vienna, he eventually forged a novel idiom for Hawai‘i domestic design. This article will examine the interiors of two of Preis's more than 100 single-family houses – the Scudder Residence (now the Scudder-Gillmar Residence) (1939-1940) and the Dr. Edward and Elsie Lau Residence (1951) – in order to highlight some of the ways in which Preis transported Viennese modern design ideas of the first three decades of the 20th century some 7,616 miles from Austria into the middle of the Pacific Ocean. His interior designs for these houses evidence strong relationships with the ideas of earlier Viennese modernists about spatial planning, the aesthetic uses of materials, furnishings, and color. Perhaps more than any other influence, Preis's Vienna experience culminated in modern architecture that was as sensorially pleasurable as Hawai‘i itself.",Open Access,Laura McGuire,Journal,Docomomo Journal,https://www.docomomo.com/2020/07/30/tropical-architecture-in-the-modern-diaspora/,,Docomomo International,,,Alfred Preis and Viennese Modernism in Hawai'i,2020

The director of works for the exposition, Daniel H. Burnham, wanted a symbol for the fair that would put Paris's Eiffel Tower to shame. To achieve this, he selected a simple but radical design for a revolving observation wheel using steel tension construction created by civil engineer George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. Perhaps the clearest embodiment of Chicago's—and by extension America's—technical superiority at the fair, the Ferris Wheel dominated the Midway Plaisance and became a beacon for visitors traveling to the fairgrounds.",open access,Julius L.

18045,CH-233629-16,"Archivists who work on African American collections are increasingly more aware that traditional sites of African American agency and autonomy are becoming more unstable. The need to capture the perspectives and histories of these institutions is urgent. The challenges become more acute when communities recognize the need to preserve their legacies but do not have the resources or support to make it happen. African American material culture and history remains at risk of co-optation from large institutions and individuals seeking to monetize and profit from collecting Black collections. Endemic in that process is the risk of these institutions controlling the narrative and inadvertently or deliberately erasing the narratives of these diverse communities from that community's perspective. Cultural memory workers focused on African American collections face numerous challenges: the risk of losing the materials or communities themselves; partnering with organizations and administrations with differing, and perhaps conflicting agendas; working on projects with limited or term funding; and the emotional labor of being a person of color in a predominantly white field trying to support communities that can often reflect their own experiences. How can libraries, museums, and archives bring these communities into the world of archives and empower them to protect and share their stories? How can archivists, particularly those of color, find support within their institutions and the archival profession, to accomplish this work of preserving African American cultural heritage?

Second, low-attention, low-control actions are caused by the same states at play when executing high-attention, high-control actions, in which case there is no ontological difference in the states involved in these behaviors.

Reliance on belief in understanding and predicting behavior is widespread. Examples can be found, inter alia, in the placebo, attribution theory, theory of mind, and comparative psychological literatures. Research on belief also provides evidence for robust generalizations, including about how we fix, store, and change our beliefs. Evidence supports the existence of a Spinozan system of belief fixation: one that is automatic and independent of belief rejection. Independent research supports the existence of a system of fragmented belief storage: one that relies on large numbers of causally isolated, context-sensitive stores of belief in memory. Finally, empirical and observational data support at least two systems of belief change. One system adheres, mostly, to epistemological norms of updating; the other, the psychological immune system, functions to guard our most centrally held beliefs from potential inconsistency with newly formed beliefs. Refining our understanding of these systems can shed light on pressing real-world issues, such as how fake news, propaganda, and brainwashing exploit our psychology of belief, and how best to construct our modern informational world.",Subscription,"Eric Mandelbaum, Nic Porot",Journal,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcs.1539,Journal site,Wiley,,,The Science of Belief: A Progress Report,2020
18050,FEL-257901-18,"Ensemble perception—the encoding of objects by their group properties—is known to be resistant to outlier noise. However, this resistance is somewhat paradoxical: how can the visual system determine which stimuli are outliers without already having derived statistical properties of the ensemble? A simple solution would be that ensemble perception is not a simple, one-step process; instead, outliers are detected through iterative computations that identify items with high deviance from the mean and reduce their weight in the representation over time. Here we tested this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, we found evidence that outliers are discounted from mean orientation judgments, extending previous results from ensemble face perception. In Experiment 2, we tested the timing of outlier rejection by having participants perform speeded judgments of sets with or without outliers. We observed significant increases in reaction time (RT) when outliers were present, but a decrease compared to no-outlier sets of matched range suggesting that range alone did not drive RTs. In Experiment 3 we tested the timing by which outlier noise reduces over time. We presented sets for variable exposure durations and found that noise decreases linearly over time. Altogether these results suggest that ensemble representations are optimized through iterative computations aimed at reducing noise. The finding that ensemble perception is an iterative process provides a useful framework for understanding contextual effects on ensemble perception",Subscription,"Eric Mandelbaum, Michael Epstein, Jake Quilty-Dunn, Tatiana Emmanouil",Journal,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32757592/,Pubmed,American Psychological Association,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-57018-001,Psychnet,The Outlier Paradox: The Role of Iterative Ensemble Coding in Discounting Outliers,2020

18069,RZ-51445-12,"In this article I begin a broader study of the implications of the demise of Egyptian New Kingdom rule in Canaan, focusing here on likely vectors of the transmission of Egyptian and other foreign traditions after approximately 1125 BCE and examining their implications for emergent states in the southern Levant, notably, ancient Israel during the early Iron Age. To date, in both biblical studies and Levantine archaeology, emphasis has been placed upon population movements, principally migrations of one scale or another, from Egypt to Canaan during the New Kingdom that may lie behind the exodus tradition in the Hebrew Bible as the primary framework for considering the transfer of customs and practices to early Iron Age Israel. I suggest, however, that because of limited information concerning Egypt's empire in Canaan until more recent studies, we have overlooked a significant vector in the transmission of these customs and practices, namely that individuals negotiated their identities in the context of the changing social, political, and economic circumstances that accompanied the demise of Egyptian rule at the end of the New Kingdom. The starting point for this reappraisal is a review of the evidence, particularly concerning the chronology for this process, that is now available from Jaffa. From there I consider the range of specialists impacted by Egypt's decline and the likelihood of their absorption into emerging early states like Israel. In this context, it is not my aim to replace previous discussions concerning the origins of Egyptian influences and what they may owe to other population movements. Rather, I wish to open up consideration of the very significant influence that the Egyptian Empire, after more than 350 years of direct rule in Canaan, had upon a range of traditions, many of which appear among Israelite traditions in the Hebrew Bible.",Open access,Aaron A.

Bernhardt had just missed the debut of the Creole drama Juan Moreira, previously presented as a pantomime and now enhanced with talking characters. For the next month and a half, news of both Bernhardt and Moreira appeared together in the Buenos Aires press. And it would be easy to imagine the prima donna attending any number of forms of popular entertainment during her stay, for her arrival coincided with the new spectacles of the Carlo Brothers (a U.S. circus family) and Frank Brown (an English clown), while the Italian showman Pablo Raffetto put on ""unauthorized"" version of Moreira every night.

Beyond this quality of her character, her time in the Río de la Plata reveals a rich entertainment market that emerged thanks to hemispheric migrations, with performers following a circuit that included Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and, above all, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, and smaller towns along the tributary rivers leading to the Río de la Plata. The decade of 1880 was a moment of social and growing economic crisis, where tensions increased between rural inhabitants and waves of immigrants. It also saw significant growth in the number of participants in this entertainment market, but by this time it already had a history half a century deep.

3633,RA-50089-10,"This essay pursues the prehistory of contemporary debates over corporate personality by investigating the early nineteenth-century American corporate imaginary. In 1819, Dartmouth College v. Woodward enshrined the common-law defi nition of the corporation—an artifi cial person, immortal and invisible—in American jurisprudence. In contrast, contemporaneous satirical poems on failing banks personifi ed corporations as strikingly visible and mortal. In subsequent decades, Poe drew on the legal doctrine of artificial personhood in a number of works—the sonnet ""Silence"" and the tales ""William Wilson"" and ""Peter Pendulum, the Business Man""— and juxtaposed it unsettlingly with the so-called natural personhood of human beings. Whereas literary scholarship on antebellum legal personhood has principally explored the contested status of African Americans, this essay argues that the early corporation confronted both jurists and lay writers with an idea of personhood irreducible to the human being. It shows how Poe's work, in particular, articulates the challenges posed by the complex ontology and ghostly genealogy of the corporation to the logic of human identity.",,Peter Jaros,Journal,Poe Studies 47: 4-35,,,,,,A Double Life: Personifying the Corporation from Dartmouth College to Poe,2014
3634,FA-57426-13,"Hermann Hesse's readers associate him with the ""East"" yet generally ignore his earliest writing on the topic: the mixed-genre masterpiece about India, *Robert Aghion* (1913). I argue that *Aghion* is a sophisticated critique of colonialism in which no one is innocent, not even the ""anticolonial"" hero Aghion. Through Hesse's self-fictionalization as Aghion, he casts a critical light on his own anticolonial exoticism: Aghion, like the young Hesse, hates colonialism because it creates a frighteningly ""uncanny"" (""unheimlich"") mixture of India and Europe, and so ruins Aghion's fantasies of purity. By referring to India as ""unheimlich,"" Hesse connects his story to an early twentieth-century psychoanalytic discourse more apt for understanding *Aghion* than late twentieth-century postcolonial theory, specifically Homi Bhabha's ""hybridity."" Whereas Bhabha focuses on the colonialist's fear of difference, Hesse presents an India so full of hybrid ""natives"" and European doppelgängers that Aghion cannot find the difference that he would, in Bhabha's model, have to disavow. Mirror images are everywhere, troubling Aghion with the same returns that Freud will describe only six years later: of ancient narcissisms, primitive beliefs, and repressed infantile ideas. *Aghion* thus presents us with a new concept for understanding colonialism psychoanalytically—uncanniness—at the same time that it prefigures Freud's theorizations.",subscription only,John Zilcosky,Journal,New German Critique,http://ngc.dukejournals.org/content/41/3 123/199.full.pdf+html,"John Zilcosky, ""Hermann Hesse's Colonial Uncanny: *Robert Aghion*, 1913,"" *New German Critique* 41 (Fall/Winter 2014): 199-218",Duke University Press,,,"“Hermann Hesse’s Colonial Uncanny: *Robert Aghion*, 1913” ",2014

It looks particularly at his journalism and reform writings of the 1860s and 70s, and culminates in an analysis of his novel Democracy from 1880.  Adams' great-grandfather John was a leading proponent of a senate in the deliberations over the U.S. Constitution.  For Henry, the intellectual and political legacy represented by the Senate crystallized political problems including the appropriate balance of power, the nature of representation, the threat of tyranny, and the dangers of party and personal corruption.  Adams was closely engaged with historiographical debates in England and Germany over ancient republics and the lessons they held for modern ones such as the United States.  His portrait of the corrupt senator Silas Ratcliffe in Democracy resonates in particular with Theodore Mommsen's treatment of Cicero.  In The History of Rome, Mommsen rejected the heroic image of Cicero as the father of his country and presented instead a portrait in which the Roman senator's self-interest predominated.  At the same time he burnished Caesar's image as a dictator who loved the people.  Mommsen's critique of Cicero echoes through Democracy, which concludes in some despair over the prospects of the American democratic system while offering no compensatory, heroic Caesar-figure.",,Sandra M.

However, such studies are stymied by physical and digital archives that hide more than they reveal. Bibliographies, indexes, and keyword searches alike limit our inquiries predominantly to what we already know, while the larger culture of reprinting remains buried amidst millions of pages and billions of pixels. This article argues computational tools can identify patterns of reprinting within digitized periodicals corpora that are more meaningful signals of the ""culture of reprinting"" than can be ascertained by reading or searching. The texts uncovered through these methods complicate our current understandings of genre, authorship, and influence during the period, pointing to the prominence of understudied genres such as the vignette in everyday reading and the amorphousness of authorship in a print culture founded on sharing, exchange, and remediation. When modeled at scale, this uncovered corpus suggest a diffuse, decentered, and truly national print culture that challenges studies focused on known print centers such as Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.",,Ryan Cordell,Journal,American Literary History,,,Oxford University Press,,,"Reprinting, Circulation, and the Network Author in Antebellum Newspapers",2015

Such maps identified health threats and guided movements through or out of the city. These maps proliferated before and after the creation of the Metropolitan Board of Health in 1866. Sanitarian concern about stenches echoed lay concerns, and encouraged the creation of standing health boards.

3721,RA-50062-08,"Late 19th-century Beirut and Cairo were capitals of Arabic literary production and press activity. A period, oft deemed a nah?a, that witnessed the advent of the novel form or riwaya in Arabic, this was also the moment of intensified French and British imperial involvement in the region, and the concomitant industrialization of Beirut's silk and Egypt's cotton markets. This article argues that, through the novels published in and promoted through the region's burgeoning private journals and newspapers, editors and novelists revived the literary trope of the garden of knowledge as a spatial metaphor for the Arabic reading public. While the 1870s in Beirut began as a hopeful decade—the civil war of 1860 buried in the fortunes being made off Mt.

Diplomatics concentrated on comparing the material and textual features of individual documents to authentic specimens in order to separate the genuine from the spurious, whereas the ius archivi emphasized the publica fides (public faith) that documents derived from their placement in an authentic sovereign's archive. Diplomatics' emergence as a separate auxiliary science of history encouraged the erasure of archivality from the primary conditions of documentary assessment for historians, however, while the ius archivi's privileging of institutional over material criteria for authority foreshadowed European state practice and the evolution of archivistics into the twentieth century.

3723,RA-50080-09,"Literary critics in the U.S. have generally considered the artistic merit of Langston Hughes's so-called radical poetic production of the 1930s to be far below the standard the poet set in the previous decade. Its detractors tend to distinguish it from Hughes's 1920s poetry, associating the latter with a black nationalist literary aesthetic linked to an embrace of Pan-Africanism and the former with a proletarian poetic tied to a decidedly Marxist analysis of race and class-conflict. This article offers a counter-narrative to these reigning critical discourses by focusing on an instance where Hughes mined his experience as a translator to offer an ethical, albeit pessimistic, vision of black internationalism infused with a Marxist outlook and conveyed through poetic innovations of hybrid ethno-linguistic origin. The essay's first half demonstrates that Hughes's engagement with Mayakovsky left a trail of historical and literary evidence that reveals how Mayakovsky's poetics had a profound impact on Hughes's own political outlook and poetic palette. Nowhere is this influence more clear than in Hughes's poem ""Cubes"" (1934), a reading of which forms the second part of this essay. ""Cubes"" exhibits poetic innovations provoked by his engagement with Mayakovskian poetics — particularly with Mayakovsky's notion that revolutionary poetry succeeded best when it both invoked and transgressed the rules governing ""antiquarian"" poetry in a dialectical process that he labeled as ""coup."" The literary mastery manifest in this endeavor displays the often-overlooked aesthetic sophistication of Hughes radical poetry.

The Amateur Journal was part of a fad that swept the United States after the Civil War, when thousands of teenage boys began publishing their own newspapers on diminutive printing presses. At its height in the 1880s, amateur journalism linked boys across the country into tightly knit virtual communities with their own distribution methods, literary conventions, social customs, and vernaculars. Barker likely reprinted ""Success is counted sweetest"" from the anonymous anthology A Masque of Poets, which had appeared four years before, and Dickinson was almost certainly unaware of her distant adolescent fan. But Barker's adoption of the poem—and, in a series of intriguing editorial interventions, his adaptation of it—transforms its paean to failure into a manifesto for amateurdom, networking Dickinson into one of the earliest teenage subcultures.",Open Access,Lara Cohen,Journal,"Emily Dickinson Journal 23, No. 1",https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/emily dickinson journal/v023/23.1.cohen01.pdf,Project Muse Page,The Johns Hopkins University Press,,,Emily Dickinson's Teenage Fanclub,2014

The invention of these hobby presses led to an explosion of newspapers written, edited, and printed by teenage boys, who identified themselves as ""amateur journalists."" By the end of the 1870s, every state in the union could boast at least a handful of amateur papers, and some had hundreds. There are over 55,000 in the American Antiquarian Society collections alone (fig. 2). Most issues were four to eight pages, or one or two folded sheets of paper, but some ran up to thirty-two pages. At least one was printed on the back of a postcard. About half of amateur editors printed their own papers; perhaps another quarter or third had them printed by other amateur printers, and the remainder took them to professional job printers.

3728,RA-50088-10,"Recent finds and new perspectives warrant a new understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes relating to the Philistine culture – from its appearance in the 12th cent BCE until its ultimate demise in the late Iron Age, in the 7th cent. BCE. While it is evident that a major component of the Philistine culture is foreign, it is clear that these foreign facets are of a mixed nature – including features from the Aegean, Cyprus, Anatolia, SE Europe and beyond. Likewise, it is now clear that the Philistines did not capture and destroy the Late Bronze Age sites of the Canaanites, at most destroying elite zones in some of the sites. On the contrary it appears that from the very beginning of the Iron Age, the foreign components became entangled with local Canaanite elements. Thus, from the very early stages of its appearance, the Philistine culture was characterized by an ongoing negotiation between various cultural groups of local and foreign origin. As a result of such entanglements, the process of change of the Philistine culture should not be viewed through the lens of a simplistic process of cultural change. Here as well, multivalent patterns of identity negotiation can be seen between the various groups within Philistia (as evidenced in distinct material culture patterns at different sites within Philistia), and between these groups and surrounding polities and ethnicities, with influences going in both directions. While the Philistine culture did change drastically throughout the Iron Age, shedding many of their earlier, non-local attributes, other attributes which clearly were of importance in their ongoing group definition and identity continued to be used throughout the Iron Age.",,"Aren Maier, Louise Hitchcock",Journal,Archaeological Review from Cambridge 28.1,,,,,,Beyond Creolization and Hybridity: Entangled and Transcultural Identities in Philistia,2013

Additionally, we have identified the features in our cluster assignments that might be diagnostic of regional traditions.

3805,HD-51106-10,"On quantitative approaches to editing as a fact of film history. The history of editing as sketched in this essay elaborates on the Vernacular Modernism theory proposed by Miriam Hansen in 1999. Montage theory began as a theory of practice. First reflections on film editing emerged as a set of recommendations for beginners on the pages of screenwriting manuals which mushroomed in the United States in the early 1910. What makes your screenplay screen-specific? Facial close-up that compensate for absent spoken lines; instant cuts instead of intermissions; short shots rather than lengthy scenes. Taking stock of physical, optical and temporal limitations imposed by the medium of film on actors, playwrights and directors lead to a system of continuity rules, the staple of classical Hollywood style of film narration. As an avant-garde concept, montage was part of the European film culture of the 1920s. Specifically, Soviet montage theory emerged in an attempt to adjust narrative continuity rules from the 1910s to discontinuous and extra-narrative experiments in filmmaking promoted by avant-garde directors. An heir to the continuity system, Soviet montage revised and re-theorized its Hollywood heritage. Contrast rather than continuity, cuts sooner than shots, form instead of function – such, among others, were parameters of style emphasized by Soviet montage theorists throughout the twenties.",,Yuri Tsivian,Journal,"New German Critique ","http://ngc.dukejournals.org/content/41/2 122/47.abstract ","New German Critique 122, Vol. 41, No 2, Summer 2014",Duke University,,,Talking to Miriam: Soviet Americanitis and the Vernacular Modernism Thesis,2014
3816,HD-50176-07,"One essential approach in preserving architectural heritage is the documentation of 3D geometries and surface textures of historic buildings. For example, precise colour information, excluding lighting effects, is an intrinsic property of the surface materials of building interiors and exteriors. However, while colour information has been recorded for small sample areas, it has not been accurately documented on the scale of entire building surfaces. This is critical, because building materials decay and their colours fade with time. The goal of this project is to develop a method to assist in recording and documenting the chromatic information of interiors and exteriors of historic buildings with low cost and high efficiency. The method takes advantage of emerging high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) technology, which can store rich information about colour and illumination through digital photography. By recording the colour information, in addition to the geometry and texture information obtained through other existing technologies, we can achieve more complete documentation for architectural heritage.

This paper reports on a pilot study of Metadata Games, a software system that uses computer games to collect information about archival images in libraries and archives as these institutions digitize millions of items across national collections. Games offer a unique advantage for collecting metadata because they can entice users who might normally be inclined to visit archives to explore humanities content and, in the process, contribute to vital records, and they can work in a wide-scale, distributed fashion to collect much more metadata than a typical archives staff member could contribute alone in the same time frame. Metadata Games can be used to enhance knowledge about images associated with particular disciplines and fields, or in interdisciplinary collections. This open-source system is easily customized to meet each institution's needs. By inviting mass participation, Metadata Games opens the door for archivists, researchers, and the public to unearth new knowledge that could radically enhance scholarship across the disciplines. Metadata Games expands what researchers, students, and the public can encounter in their quest to understand the human experience.

3829,FA-55067-10,"This essay recovers the literary prehistory of an overlooked popular subgenre—the Chinese invasion narrative—that continues to convey, albeit in a historically transformed way, collective anxieties over the ""Other"" that menaces American society today. By the final decades of the nineteenth century, the notion of an Asiatic threat was well established in U.S. culture, in part through the circulation of Yellow Peril discourses popularized by a variety of writings, ranging from anti-Chinese polemics, missionary tracts, travelogues, oratories, stump speeches, and Chinese invasion fiction. A product of the Pacific Coast anti-Chinese movement, the Chinese invasion subgenre first began appearing in print in the 1880s, and it offers an understudied episode in the history of literary form let alone in the social history of American race relations. The sensational futuristic plots of Chinese invasion—a subgenre now associated with early science fiction—reworked the historical tensions of American colonization and slavery and projected them onto the life-and-death struggle between the U.S. and China. Set in a future in which Chinese aggressors have subjugated white America, invasion narratives by a range of largely forgotten writers, including Pierton Dooner, Robert Woltor, Arthur Dudley Vinton, James D. Corrothers, and Vachel Lindsay linked industrial modernization to national dissolution, as they imagined China as the horizon of capitalist markets. In envisioning the tragic consequences of unrestricted Chinese immigration, these narratives absorbed and refracted white anxieties over the end of western expansion—indeed, of American Manifest Destiny—and the changing composition of the national polity in the wake of black citizenship and suffrage.",open access,Edlie Wong,Journal,American Literary History,http://alh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/07/04/alh.aju030.full.pdf?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=SJ5taZy0aOAzuQH,American Literary History,Oxford University Press,,,"In a Future Tense: Immigration Law, Counterfactual Histories, and Chinese Invasion Fiction",2014

18147,RZ-255605-17,"Sufism was a constituent component of Islamic Central Asian society from at least the thirteenth century, and despite challenges to its survival during the Soviet era, the cultural, social, doctrinal, and spiritual legacy of Sufism survives in the form of written traditions (hagiography, Sufi poetry, historical writing), oral traditions (passed from generation to generation which, themselves, were often textualized in the form of hagiography), and the sacred landscape of shrines. This chapter explores the literary and physical dimensions of the interrelated processes of the memorialization of Sufi saints from the sixteenth to the twentieth century - specifically, how textual and oral traditions about Sufi saints overlap and intersect and are formed and re-formed over time, and how burial places (real or imagined) of saints are transformed into shrines, often incorporating and reflecting a combination of mythic and Islamic motifs.

The adoption of this text into an Isma¯?i¯li¯ codex suggests an exchange between two disparate Islamic religious traditions in Central Asia between which there has hitherto been little evidence of contact. Previous scholarship on Isma¯?i¯li¯-Sufi relations has focused predominately on the literary and intellectual engagement between these traditions, while the history of persecution experienced by the Isma¯?i¯li¯s at the hands of Sunni¯ Muslims has largely overshadowed discussions of the social relationship between the Isma¯?i¯li¯s and other Muslim communities in Central Asia. I demonstrate that this textual exchange provides evidence for a previously unstudied social engagement between Isma¯?i¯li¯ and Sunni¯ communities in Central Asia that was facilitated by the rise of the Khanate of Khoqand in the 18th century. The mountainous territory of Shughna¯n, where the manuscript under consideration originated, has been typically represented in scholarship as isolated prior to the onset of colonial interest in the region in the late 19th century. Building upon recent research on the impact of early modern globalization on Central Asia, I demonstrate that even this remote region was significantly affected by the intensification of globalizing processes in the century preceding the Russian conquest. Accordingly, I take this textual exchange as a starting point for a broader re-evaluation of the Isma¯?i¯li¯-Sufi relationship in Central Asia and of the social ‘connectivity' of the Isma¯?i¯li¯s and the Badakhsha¯n region within early modern Eurasia.",,Daniel Beben,Journal,,http://https://www.worldcat.org/title/amad-yasavi-and-the-ismailis-of-badakhshan-towards-a-new-social-history-of-sufi-shii-relations-in-central-asia/oclc/8760552462&amp;referer=brief results,,Journal - Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient,,,"""Ahmad Yasavi and the Isma?ilis of Badakhshan: Towards a New Social History of Sufi-Shi?i Relations in Central Asia""",2020

An edition and translation of this work was first published by Wladimir Ivanow, who judged it to be a ‘forgery' by the tenth/sixteenth-century Isma?ili missionary Khayrkhwa¯h Hara¯ti¯. Ivanow concluded that while the text overall holds value as a specimen of Isma?ili doctrinal writing, its first chapter, which purports to be an autobiographical account of its reputed author, Na¯?ir-i Khusraw, is an irrelevant appendage to the work. Since then, Ivanow's interpretation has remained broadly authoritative within the field. In recent years, however, multiple new manuscripts of the work and a range of related materials have come to light, indicating the need for a thorough re-evaluation of the text and its history. In this article I demonstrate that Hara¯ti¯ had no role in the development of the Kala¯m-i pi¯r and that its production should be dated to the eighteenth century, rather than the sixteenth. Furthermore, I argue that the attribution to Na¯?ir-i Khusraw, elaborated in the first chapter, is not incidental to the text, but central to understanding its significance within the Isma?ili tradition of Central Asia. The text must be considered within the context of the history of Badakhshan in the eighteenth century, which saw an energetic expansion of the Isma?ili mission (da?wa) in the region and the development of a competitive hagiographical tradition connected with Na¯?ir-i Khusraw among various constituencies.

The technical and artistic ""recipes"" contained in Ms. Fr. 640 provide an outstanding opportunity to explore the epistemic and historical intersections between craft making and scientific knowing, especially in light of the emergence of a new science in the following centuries. Ms. Fr. 640 provides important insights into the material, technical, and intellectual worlds of late sixteenth-century Europe, and brings a better understanding of how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected and appreciated in early modern Europe. It sheds light, as well, on the type of knowledge possessed by handworkers, known today as ""practical knowledge,"" ""how-to,"" or ""makers' knowledge."" At the heart of the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640, however, lies an intriguing puzzle: who was the anonymous individual who wrote down (and in many cases tried out) these 930 entries filling 170 folios, and why did a French nobleman collect and preserve this manuscript?",open access,Pamela H.

18163,RQ-249842-16,"What are historians doing in the laboratory? Looking back over six years of collaborative work, researchers of the Making and Knowing Project at Columbia University discuss their experience with hands-on reconstruction as a historical method. This work engages practical forms of knowledge—from pigment-making to metal casting—recorded in the BnF Ms. Fr. 640, an anonymous French manuscript compiled in the later sixteenth century. Bodily encounters with materials and processes of the past offer insights into the material and mental worlds of early modern artists and artisans, and train the eye in the interpretation of historical objects. At the same time, reconstruction contributes to the interpretation of the text: it is only by attempting to implement the instructions of practical or recipe literature that these texts can be understood as vehicles of emergent knowledge that only fully manifests itself in the doing. Overall, our approach to reconstruction mirrors that of the anonymous author-practitioner, who explored a wide range of techniques through experimenting and writing.",paid,"Tillmann Taape, Tianna Helena Uchacz, Pamela H.

18202,RZ-249831-16,"Abstract: The Afanasievo world reportedly overlaps the borders of five nations including two countries of East Asia: Mongolia and China.  Across these several regions, the first appearance of domestic herd animals (sheep, goat, cattle) and the initial practice of copper and bronze metallurgy are associated with Afanasievo communities. Since mobile pastoralism has long been a significant part of the Mongolian cultural tradition the question of when, where, and how Afanasievo groups entered Mongolia is of extreme interest to archaeologists.  Over the past 50 years several important sites have been reported and analyzed but these are still little known among Western scholars.  In this study we provide a brief overview of Afanasievo archaeology, its peripheries, and its recent analytical breakthroughs and then develop a unique perspective on the Afanasievo world from its farthest eastern edge in central Mongolia.  We assess the different roles of migration and diffusion in the process of herd animal introduction and present two current hypotheses explaining the intensification of pastoralism in this region during the late 3rd and early 2nd millennium BC.  We argue that the impact of Afanasievo entry into East Asia was a transformative process but must be understood in the context of significant innovations made by East Asian indigenous communities, eventually leading to a unique form of eastern steppe pastoralism in Mongolia.",Subscription,"Honeychurch, W, Rogers, L.,, Amartuvshin, Ch, Diimaajav, E., Erdene-Ochir, N-O., Hall, M.E., Hrivnyak, M.",Journal,Archaeological Research in Asia,Forthcoming,,,,,The earliest herders of East Asia: Examining Afanasievo entry to central Mongolia,2021
18204,RZ-249831-16,"Cast iron objects recovered primarily in eastern Mongolia, spanning the Xiongnu through the Early Historic periods (ca. 3rd BC–AD 17th century), were examined for their radiocarbon (14C) concentration and microstructure. Most of the samples examined were found to have originated from charcoal-based smelting with a few exceptions that were made using a mineral coal-based technique. A comparison of 14C dates with dates derived from artifact typology allowed the charcoal-smelted objects to be classified into two groups, based on whether the radiometric and typological periodization are in agreement or not. In addition, those with differing 14C and typological dates can be divided into two subgroups with and without evidence for a melt treatment applied after original casting. These conflicting dating results are confusing and would seem to provoke skepticism about the use of 14C measurements for dating iron artifacts. We demonstrate however that 14C analysis, when combined with metallographic examination and other lines of chronological evidence, can clarify the history of a given iron object and its multiple users, often separated in time by more than a millennium.",subscription,"Park, J.S., Honeychurch, W., Amartuvshin, Ch.",Journal,Radiocarbon,http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/technological-and-chronological-implication-of-14c-concentrations-in-carbon-samples-extracted-from-mongolian-cast-iron-artifacts/949FE72CB0FC596DF3047B2A0645C3BF,,,,,The Technological and Chronological Implication of 14C Concentrations in Carbon Samples extracted from Mongolian Cast Iron Artifacts,2019

It does so through a close reading of a Hebrew feuilleton, written by Simhah Ben Zion and published in 1907 in the first issue of the Palestine-based Hebrew journal Ha-'omer. At the center of the feuilleton is a living wonderment: an eight-year-old girl—the narrator's daughter—who speaks no fewer than eight languages, one for each year of her life. Although the narrator and his wife, both ardent Zionists, struggle to maintain a Hebrew-speaking home, they soon learn that their sociolinguistic reality does not coincide with the monolingual fantasy of imposing Hebrew as an exclusive, isolated language. The article argues that in the midst of an endeavor to reterritorialize Hebrew creativity in Palestine and constitute the Hebrew-speaking native, Ben Zion's feuilleton satirically narrates Hebrew revival as a chaotic Babel, revealing not only the failures of this project but also its latent anxieties.",Open Access,Roni Henig,Journal,Dibur: Literary Journal,https://arcade.stanford.edu/dibur/multilingual-anxiety-and-invention-hebrew-native-reading-hebrew-feuilleton-s-ben-zion,,Arcade: A Digital Salon,,,“Multilingual Anxiety and the Invention of the Hebrew Native: A Reading of a Hebrew Feuilleton by S.

Scholars of modern Jewish literature have not paid enough attention to the coffeehouse and to its important role as a new kind of Jewish space, one that enabled and fostered novel forms of journalism and literature. This is especially true for the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the period associated mostly with the Haskalah. Thinking about Haskalah culture in spatial terms usually relies on a dichotomy between the synagogue and secular institutions, the idea that religion constituted the single moral authority and was exclusively associated with the synagogue, the house of study, and other traditional Jewish spaces. This article focuses on the importance of the café as a thirdspace, in Edward Soja's terms, one that does not fit comfortably in the dichotomy between religious and secular spaces (or other dichotomies such as public and private, inside and outside).

18263,RA-50091-10,"By the end of the eighteenth century, emerging states in South Asia drew on successive waves of migration to staff their institutions. Scholars, poets and bureaucrats in these new states were entrusted with the crafting and maintenance of new bureaucratic systems and cultural spaces. The attempts to create shared bonds in these new spaces, however, also created tensions between those who were recent arrivals in these communities and those whose families had settled there earlier. In the fiercely competitive world of late Mughal literary culture, the task of uniting these groups by creating new networks was complicated by divergent goals. I examine how the writing and dissemination of new histories, memoirs and literary works with a literary network connected with one author, Lachmi Narayan ‘Shafiq,' built a shared history in the eighteenth-century Deccan, but also created moments of acute conflict and dissent through its literary production. The competing needs for individual self-presentation and success in the competitive climate of the period undercut the desire to forge collaborative networks. The conflicting record of these collaborations and fault lines in the archival records of this period invite us to revisit the ways in which both collective and individual identities were forged in this period.",open access,Purnima Dhavan,Journal,The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0019464620948702,Journal web site,Sage,,,Networks and fault lines in eighteenth-century Deccani literary communities: Lachmi Narayan ‘Shafiq’ and his circle,2020
18264,RA-50126-14,"This article focuses on a Tamil Hindu woman named Aaru, who embodied the Goddess in possession performances from age thirteen, resisted marriage through her twenties, and committed suicide at twenty--nine. Grounded in ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with Aaru and her family conducted between 2006 and 2019, it analyses narratives concerning her untimely death, subsequent deification, and eventual domestication as a puva?aikkari. It highlights the hermeneutical challenges associated with three intersecting spheres: the dominant categories that shape the scholarly understanding of Hinduism; vernacular Hinduism as revealed in Aaru's complex story; and the ethnographic research and writing process. I resist an arbitrary resolution of the gaps and seeming inconsistencies that abound in these accounts, arguing instead that we can enlarge and nuance our understandings of matters as diverse as ritual relationships with the dead, the nature of Tamil family deities, and the gendered tensions of the contemporary moment if we hold space for multiple interpretive possibilities. Indeed, Aaru's case offers us significant resources for a fuller, more inclusive appreciation of the textures of vernacular Hinduism – Hinduism as it is experienced, lived, and practiced in particular places and contexts – and compels us to consider the limitations of prevailing interpretive paradigms and the fragmental and shifting nature of ethnographic knowledge.",open access,Amy Allocco,Journal,The Journal of Hindu Studies,https://academic.oup.com/jhs/article/13/2/144/5923484,journal web site,Oxford University Press,,,"Vernacular Practice, Gendered Tensions, and Interpretive Ambivalence in Hindu Death, Deification, and Domestication Narratives",2020

18266,RA-50126-14,"There has been a resurgence of recreational cycling in Mumbai, as elsewhere in India, since the early 2010s. A significant reason for the new popularity of cycling has to do with the immersion in the urban landscape that it offers; people are attracted by the pleasures of the embodied experiences of cycling as well as interactions with the varied communities of cyclists with whom they share the road. This paper shows how surfaces matter both materially and metaphorically in opening new possibilities for understanding fun, recreation and pleasure. Whereas in critical urban studies and related fields, surface often connotes superficiality or a cover over the real, I argue that attention to surfaces and its pleasures is what enables people to emphasize the productive possibilities of ‘convivial alliances' across differences and to promote an agenda for sustainable transportation politics that goes beyond infrastructure building.",open access,Jonathan Shapiro Anjaria,Journal,South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00856401.2020.1703324,journal web site,Taylor &amp; Francis,,,Surface Pleasures: Bicycling and the Limits of Infrastructural Thinking,2020

Creative iconoclasm is essentially when a renovation deviates so far from the original intended form of a building that the building loses its previous meaning and takes on different meaning altogether. Hence, the use of the term iconoclasm (destruction of an image). More recently, art historian Meredith Cohen has written about the ""creative interventions"" done to medieval structures. They leave in their wake a whole new history, vastly different from what had been recognized for hundreds of years.

18349,FS-267176-19,"This essay examines the research, drawings, and paintings of the Afro-Brazilian artist Rubem Valentim produced during his trip to Western Europe and Senegal from 1963–66. Valentim's work has recently become a paradigm of Brazilian geometric abstraction. Scholars have largely interpreted the symbolism in his paintings as deriving exclusively from Brazilian African-derived religions and as divorced from contemporaneous politics. Building on this literature, I explore the political dimensions and multifaceted articulations of abstraction in Valentim's five notebooks from his trip to Europe, which have only come to light in the past few years and are the foundation of his painting practice. I argue that his study of African and Polynesian objects from the British Museum as well as his abstract notebook drawings highlight his private support of Third-Worldism, which promoted solidarity amongst countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in favor of national liberation and against global capitalism. Valentim's time abroad coincided with the Brazilian military coup in April 1964, whose regime combatted progressive politics like Third-Worldism. While his notebook drawings contained politicized words opposing the dictatorship, the resulting paintings are devoid of them, which qualified them for regime-sponsored exhibitions like the Brazilian display at the 1966 First World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar and veiled the artist's private resistance embedded in his geometry. The true intentions of his abstract visual language, revealed in the notebooks, were unintelligible to the regime, making his work a contested landscape of political conversation.",Subscription only,Abigail Lapin Dardashti,Journal,Art Journal,,Article is accepted and forthcoming.,Art Journal,,,"Abstracted Resistance: Third-Worldism in Rubem Valentim's Afro-Brazilian Symbolism, 1963-1966",2021
18351,FS-267176-19,"""Tapestried Landscape: The Queer Influence of Roberto Burle Marx on Elizabeth Bishop's Brazil""  This essay examines queer affinities in the Brazilian landscapes of Elizabeth Bishop and the landscape artist Roberto Burle Marx. It considers how these two artists, working across national borders and artistic mediums, realized their similar perspectives on mediated nature and the relationship to aesthetic representation, queer identity, and ecology. In this essay, I suggest that Burle Marx's aesthetic influence, and his personal entanglement with Bishop and her partner, Lota de Macedo Soares, illuminate two major Bishop poems: ""Brazil, January 1, 1502"" from her 1965 volume Questions of Travel, and ""Crusoe in England"" from Geography III (1976). In the presciently ecocritical ""Brazil,"" Bishop complicates the commonplace view that tropical landscape is a wild and untouched first nature by highlighting the landscape forms the Portuguese projected onto it. The poem's alternation between nature and its visual representation in painting and tapestry links the poem to Burle Marx's distinct practices of landscape design and fine art painting, and his philosophy of landscape as a form of ""artificial nature."" In the essay's second section, I establish Macedo Soares and Burle Marx's fractious collaboration on the design of Flamengo Park, which informs Bishop's ambivalent descriptions of tropical landscape in her later poems. Finally, I draw a connection between Bishop's obliquely autobiographical ""Crusoe"" and her image of Burle Marx as botanist–explorer in the Darwin tradition. The queer dimension of Bishop's poem echoes Burle Marx's collecting expeditions, especially those he undertook with the architect Rino Levi. Alongside Bishop's lifetime of reading scientific adventure accounts, Burle Marx's real-world plant expeditions offer the poet a model of queer botanizing.",Subscription,Chris Schmidt,Journal,Modernism/Modernity,,Article is accepted and forthcoming.,Modernism/modernity,,,“Tapestried Landscape: The Queer Influence of Roberto Burle Marx on Elizabeth Bishop’s Brazil”,2020

The sequence is meant to provide a picture of Bishop as a student of Brazilian place and language. In the process, the sequence suggests how naming and renaming may abet the colonial and capitalist territorializing of land into property.       In an iterative sequence of four page-spreads, I compile all the place names that Bishop used in her Collected Poetry, then reproduce exactly their coordinates, as if on a map, on the recto and verso sides of codex page-spreads. I place all the places names from the Northern hemisphere onto one page–spread, and all the names from the Southern hemisphere (which are exclusively in Brazil) on another spread. In the two subsequent spreads, I perform some selective translation to understand which Brazilian place names Bishop translated from Portuguese into English—and why. In the final page-spread, I isolate Brazilian place names that either retain or replace known indigenous place names.     In my research process note, I ask why Bishop translates some Brazilian place names into English and not others; and raise questions about how name-giving encodes power, and in some cases resists it.",Open access,Chris Schmidt,Journal,"Denver Quarterly, vol. 54, no. 20 pp. 82-91",http://https://www.du.edu/denverquarterly/current/index.html,"This article was published in the last issue of Denver Quarterly, but the website has not yet been updated.",Denver Quarterly,,,“Geographies IV-VII.”,2020

To this end, the present work directly compared the impact of various ""emphasis frames,"" highlighting distinct intrinsic motivational factors, used to describe an online game in which players provide descriptive metadata ""tags"" for digitized images.  An initial study showed that, compared to frames emphasizing personal enjoyment or altruistic motivations, a frame emphasizing a ""growing community of players"" solicited significantly fewer contributions.  A second study tested the hypothesis that this lower level of contribution resulted from social loafing (the tendency to exert less effort in collective tasks in which contributions are anonymous and pooled).  Results revealed that, compared to a no-frame control condition, a frame emphasizing the preponderance of other players reduced contribution levels and game replay likelihood, whereas a frame emphasizing the scarcity of fellow players increased contribution and replay levels.

It argues that Brazilian scholars often rejected the frontier as an analytical concept because of perceived excesses in its application to U.S. history. These reservations proved prescient, as their North American colleagues would come to share many of the same objections. In pushing the idea aside, however, Brazilian scholars sometimes overlooked the historical relevance of frontier incorporation during the colonial period. A renewal of scholarly interest in the subject points to a growing conviction that the colonial history of Brazil cannot be adequately rendered without close attention to internal territorial consolidation, whether or not the term frontier is used to describe this process.

More than most types of humanistic study, editing has been significantly affected by the digital turn, though perhaps even editing has not been sufficiently altered. The monumental scholarly edition, our marvelous inheritance from print culture, still tends to focus on individual figures. Generally speaking, editing work in American literary and historical studies focuses on canonical writers and political leaders—that is, on white male writers and the founding fathers and other prominent political figures. Yet these emphases run counter to an ongoing revisionist trend in both fields—in literary studies the standing of the author has been questioned, cultural studies has flourished, and the canon has dramatically expanded, while in history a bottom-up view of change and significance has led in recent decades to an emphasis on social history (and of course a de-emphasis on ""great men""). A focus on individual writers or political figures need hardly be the focus of editorial efforts, of course.

4009,RA-50105-11,"Shah Ismail Safavi emerged as the revolutionary leader of a new, Shi?ite movement in western Iran in the early years of the sixteenth century. News of his rise to power reached Western Europe almost immediately and provoked a wide range of responses: some observers hoped he would join the Christian princes of Europe in a new offensive against their common enemy, the Ottoman Turks. Others saw him as an economic and social revolutionary who brought justice to the poor and dispossessed of Persia and whose works might occasion similar reforms in Europe.

Sancho's text included a lengthy description of the architecture and plan of Cuzco, the capital of the Inca Empire, and was the first such description to appear in print. Previous scholarship has used it as a primary source for reconstructing the appearance of Inca Cuzco as seen by Sancho, Pizarro, and their cohort at the moment of their arrival there in 1533. The text, however, is also evidence for other kinds of historical information, for it demonstrates how habits of description engaged in the production of space. The impact of Sancho's textual representation of Cuzco is evident in a contemporary reaction to it — a woodcut print that accompanied it when it was first published.

4016,RA-50105-11,"Sometime in the late 1590s, the Welsh amateur mathematician John Bulkeley wrote to Thomas Harriot asking his opinion about the properties of a truly gargantuan (but totally imaginary) plano-spherical convex lens, 48 feet in diameter. While Bulkeley's original letter is lost, Harriot devoted several pages to the optical properties of ""Mr Bulkeley his Glasse"" in his optical papers (now in British Library MS Add. 6789), paying particular attention to the place of its burning point. Harriot's calculational methods in these papers are almost unique in Harriot's optical remains, in that he uses both the sine law of refraction and interpolation from Witelo's refraction tables in order to analyze the passage of light through the glass. For this and other reasons, it is very likely that Harriot wrote his papers on Bulkeley's glass very shortly after his discovery of the law and while still working closely with Witelo's great Optics; the papers represent, perhaps, his very first application of the law. His and Bulkeley's interest in this giant glass conform to a long English tradition of curiosity about the optical and burning properties of large glasses, which grew more intense in late sixteenth-century England. In particular, Thomas Digges's bold and widely known assertions about his father's glasses that could see things several miles distant and could burn objects a half-mile or further away may have attracted Harriot and Bulkeley's skeptical attention; for Harriot's analysis of the burning distance and the intensity of Bulkeley's fantastic lens, it shows that Digges's claims could never have been true about any real lens (and this, I propose, was what Bulkeley had asked about in his original letter to Harriot).

Hence, flight from plague created tensions between the Ottoman central administration and the Jewish broadcloth weavers of Salonica.

This paper argues that the relationship between statistics and social forms is not solely one of description. To the extent that statistics do not merely study or represent the objects they are purported to be about, but are intimately involved in intervening in/on those objects (e.g. social, economic, or ecological processes) and in fact in remaking them through reform and/or development, they have a performative nature. In this sense, statistics are less a methodology and more a technology—a technology of governance.

4041,RA-50040-06,"On 28 June 1797, the governor of Rumeli (that is, the Ottoman Balkans), El-Hac Mustafa Pasa, reported to Sultan Selim III (r. 1789–1808) that the notorious bandit Kara Feyzi had attacked the retinue of a local notable, a certain Osman Usta, near the town of Çirmen (now Ormenio in Greece). Though Osman did not slay the bandit leader, he killed over thirty of his men, among whom were some of Kara Feyzi's most trusted lieutenants. The uniqueness of this dispatch — one among hundreds of archival sources describing Ottoman officials' encounters with this network of bandits — lies in the governor's noting that this particular bandit risked his life in order to prevent Osman Usta from mutilating the bodies of his fallen comrades. Kara Feyzi and his men allegedly collected and burned the corpses of their slain followers in the house of an ‘infidel' while under heavy fire in order to spare their severed heads from becoming symbols of the state's victory over Kara Feyzi's retinue. The governor concludes the dispatch by suggesting that the sultan should confer prestigious ceremonial robes, luxurious sable furs, as well as cash, weapons and supplies, upon Osman Usta and his men for the valour they displayed, even though Kara Feyzi denied them the physical ‘proof' of their deeds usually required for securing such imperial benefaction.&#x0D; &#x0D; This anecdote opens a window into the material, symbolic and moral economies of banditry in Ottoman society.",paywall,Tolga U.

4043,RA-50040-06,"In the early 1610s, communities of diplomats and traders with the status of müste'min (foreign resident) in Ottoman Galata were put on alert by the concerted attempt of certain Ottoman officials, especially the kadi of Galata, to extract from them the harac—the tax typically paid only by the ?immis (non-Muslim subjects of the sultan).Interwoven into this legal and diplomatic crisis is another story that sheds an interesting light on the entire affair. In 1609 Spanish king Philip III proclaimed the expulsion of Moriscos—(forcibly) Christianized Spanish Muslims—from the Iberian peninsula, triggering a massive exodus of a large segment of population into North Africa, but also to Ottoman Constantinople, via France and Venice. Although Constantinople received a significantly smaller number of refugees than North African principalities under Ottoman suzerainty, the impact of the Morisco diaspora was disproportionally large. In Constantinople, the refugees were settled in Galata, in what appears to be a deliberate attempt by the Ottoman authorities to change the confessional make-up of this overtly non-Muslim section of the city. This is how the fierce economic and confessional competition among the local, already established trading and diplomatic communities and the newcomers began. The paper will reconstruct these competitive relationships on the basis of Ottoman, Venetian, and French contemporary sources by focusing on the incidents surrounding the attempted imposition of the harac on foreign residents and the attempted takeover of Galata churches by the Morisco refugees. It appears that the arrival of the Moriscos and familiarity with their plight in Spain prompted Ottoman officials to rethink the legal status and the notions of extra-territoriality in relation to religious identity in the Ottoman context as well.",paywall,Tijana Krstic,Journal,"Oriente Moderno ",http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22138617-12340024,access to article abstract and full text,Brill,,,"Contesting Subjecthood and Sovereignty in Ottoman Galata in the Age of Confessionalization:  The Carazo Affair, 1613-1617",2013

Preserved as summaries of daily legal proceedings, they give historians a unique opportunity to access information about the names, characteristics, and socio-economic status of individuals and the laws, local customs, and legal institutions of societies. Although researchers have noted various limitations of these records, the problem of selection bias has not been systematically studied. Since litigants would probably settle disputes in which one side is likely to be a clear winner, the cases that go to trial are more likely to be the difficult and uncertain ones that comprise a non-random subset of all disputes. This article presents a study of selection bias in Ottoman courts in the town of Kastamonu in northern Anatolia, from the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Disputes are categorized by type and the distribution of court participants is studied according to composition, gender, and socio-religious status. A regression analysis is run to determine the factors affecting the likelihood of cases being tried in court. The results indicate that the cases that ended up in court were selected systematically.

Minhagbücher composed in seventeenth-century Worms and Frankfurt urged the preservation and reinstatement of medieval customs relating to synagogue worship and rituals practiced in the home, while in some cases newer customs were also incorporated. However, the writings of Rabbi Ya'ir ?ayyim Bacharach were more far-reaching in response to the crisis of authority, as is evident in his forthright independence in matters of ritual and law. Customs could be considered authentic, in his view, provided they were textually based, were proven to be historically reliable, and enjoyed popular consent. His decision to consult kabbalistic sources—a departure from the resistance Kabbalah had encountered in early modern Ashkenaz—rested in part on the theological appeal of mysticism.

At these particular biographical moments, objects in the collection were differently construed as native curios and ethnological specimens, national patrimony, and primitive art.

4366,FB-55583-11,"In the first decade of the twenty-first century, Japan experienced a surge in the evocation of the word ""mottainai,"" most simply translated as ""wasteful."" Children's literature, massmarket nonfiction, magazines, newspapers, songs, government ministries, corporations, and nongovernmental organizations deliberately used and defined the term as they took up the question of what was to be deemed wasteful. This essay examines how discourses that were ostensibly about wastefulness constituted an articulation of values, a search for meaning and identity, and a certain conception of affluence in millennial Japan. It suggests that this idea of mottainai reflected wide-ranging principles and beliefs that were thought to define what it meant to be Japanese in the twenty-first century, at a time when there settled in an uneasy acceptance of economic stagnation and a desire to find meaning in an economically anemic, yet still affluent, Japan.",,"Siniawer, Eiko Maruko",Journal,The Journal of Asian Studies,,,,,,"""'Affluence of the Heart': Wastefulness and the Search for Meaning in Millennial Japan""",2014

18384,FT-264875-19,"This article investigates a hitherto overlooked calligraphic form known in Islamic art as muthanna, mirror writing. Previous scholarship has maintained that mirror compositions originated in Iran around the thirteenth century. Establishing muthanna's relationship with reversed, repeated, and symmetrically arranged unidirectional inscriptions from pre- and non-Islamic contexts, the study traces the art form's history to late Antiquity—at least five centuries earlier than previously believed, when Byzantine and Arab forces were fervently negotiating territories, as well as political, religious, and visual identities. An examination of a corpus of textiles attributed to workshops in Palestine-Syria and Egypt reveals the multi-cultural, multi-religious, and multi-linguistic anatomy of mirror compositions. A silk fragment featuring the monogram of Heraclius helps place mirror compositions to the seventh century C.E. with greater certainty, affirming the author's proposition that mirror writing was practiced by non-Muslim artists before the principles of Islamic calligraphy were firmly established. This new evidence reinforces the importance of celebrating muthanna not as an isolated Islamic art form, as has been the common approach, but rather as a hybrid product of centuries-old experiments with writing directionalities even prior to the advent of Islam. Furthermore, texts featured in inscriptions that were disseminated from Abbasid Baghdad and Fatimid Egypt between the tenth and twelfth centuries suggest that Muslims' appropriation of this late Antique art form was not a mere result of uncalculated acculturation. Rather, muthanna's adoption in Islamic art was a deliberate religiopolitical intervention at a time when an expanding, if politically divided, Muslim empire was striving to formulate a simultaneously familiar and distinct aesthetic idiom fit for its imperial vision.",,Esra Akin-KIvanc,Journal,"Dumbarton Oaks Papers, vol. 75 (2021)",https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780884024835,Publisher's website,"Harvard University Press, Dumbarton Oaks Papers",,,In the Mirror of the Other: Imprints of Muslim-Christian Encounters in the Late Antique and Early Medieval Mediterranean,2020

Conceptualizing the history of school desegregation as difficult history, the authors conducted the content analysis of 23 written lesson plans generated by workshop participants. The historiography of school desegregation, and research on four dimensions of historical inquiry such as Change and Continuity, Causation, Multiple Perspectives and Historical Sources, guided the data analysis. The findings suggest that teachers in this study were most likely to design their inquiry around Causation, framing the history of school desegregation within the classical timeline of the Civil Rights Movement, which begins with the Brown v. Board of Education decision (1954) and ends with the Civil Rights Act of 1968. What was often absent in these inquiries was Massive Resistance, the backlash against the Brown v.

18513,CHA-261908-19,"Digital data play an increasingly important role in how we understand the present and the past. The challenges inherent in understanding and using digital data are as intellectually demanding as any other archaeological research endeavor. For these reasons, data management cannot be regarded as a simple compliance or technical issue. For data to be meaningfully preserved and used in intellectually rigorous ways, they need to be integrated fully into all aspects of archaeological practice, including ethics, teaching, and publishing. In this review, we highlight some of the significant and multifaceted challenges involved in managing data, including documentation, training, methodology, data modeling, trust, and ethical concerns. We then focus on the importance of building data literacy broadly among archaeologists so that we can manage and communicate the data our discipline creates. This involves more than learning to use a new tool or finding a data manager for one's excavation or survey. Long-term, responsible stewardship of data requires understanding the workflows and human roles in data management. Putting effort now into thoughtful data management and broad data-literacy training means we will be able to make the most of the ""bigger"" data that archaeologists now produce.

The documentation and accurate translation of human sensory perspectives is fundamental to the ecological validity of cultural heritage fieldwork and the preservation of heritage acoustics. Auditory distance cues, which enable and constrain sonic communication, relate to proxemics, contextualized understandings of distance relationships that are fundamental to human social interactions. We propose that source–receiver locations in aural heritage measurements should be selected to represent a comprehensive range of proxemics according to site-contextualized spatial-use scenarios, and we identify and compare acoustical metrics for auditory distance cues from acoustical fieldwork we conducted using this strategy in three contrasting case-study heritage sites.

18602,AK-255350-17,"Abstraction, defined in Computer Science (CS) as bracketing unnecessary information from diverse components within a system, serves as a central epistemological axis in CS disciplinary and pedagogical practices. Its impressions can be seen across curricula, syllabi, classroom structures, IT systems; and other dimensions of the epistemic infrastructure of CS. As we will argue in this essay, abstraction in CS serves as an epistemic, cultural, and ideological wall to integrated critical-technical education, rather than as a bridge. Further, this wall is disguised as a bridge: the common language used across CS and the Humanities gives the impression that abstraction can be leveraged as a boundary object, as a point of connection among conflicting or incommensurable epistemic cultures. Rather, computational knowledge practices leverage abstraction's homographic-ness, epistemically structuring collaborative efforts in anti-political ways. To illustrate the impacts of abstraction, this essay will introduce ‘Critical CS1,' a hybrid pedagogical approach to teaching Computer Science through feminist and critical race theory.

Results reveal a feature that is best interpreted as the remains of a large, circular earthwork, similar to so-called council circles documented at five other contemporary sites of the Great Bend aspect cultural assemblage. We also located several features that may be remains of house basins, the size and configuration of which conform with historical evidence. These findings point to major investment in the construction of largescale ritual, elite, or defensive structures, lending support to the interpretation of the cluster of Great Bend aspect sites in the lower Walnut River as a single, sprawling population center, as well as demonstrating the potential for thermal and multispectral surveys to reveal archaeological landscape features in the Great Plains and beyond.",,"Donald Blakeslee, Jesse Casana, Elise J.

18653,HAA-256086-17,"Locating the subtle and uneven deposition of human activities across the landscape continues to challenge archaeologists. Existing tools (e.g. excavation, shovel testing, pedestrian survey, and terrestrial geophysics) have proven effective at locating many types of archaeological features but remain time-consuming and difficult to undertake on densely vegetated or topographically complex terrain. As a result of these limitations, key aspects of past communities remain largely outside of archaeological detection and interpretation. This flattening of past lifeways not only affects broader understandings of these communities, but can also negatively impact the preservation of archaeological sites. This paper presents the detection of archaeological features through an analysis of drone-acquired thermal, multispectral, and visible light imagery, alongside historical aerial photography, in the area surrounding Middle Grant Creek (11WI2739), a late prehistoric village located at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in Will County, IL. Our investigations discovered a probable housing area and a ritual enclosure, increasing the area of the site from 3.4?ha to 20?ha. The proposed housing and ritual areas of this village also help contextualize finds from the ongoing archaeological excavations at Middle Grant Creek. More broadly, results demonstrate the valuable contributions that these relatively new archaeological survey methods have in shaping our understandings of the archaeological landscape and highlight the importance of integrating them into the archaeological toolkit.",,"Jesse Casana, Madeleine McLeester, Mark Schurr, Austin Chad Hill, J.H.

Summarizing investigations at archaeological sites in North America, the Mediterranean, and the Near East, our results illustrate some contexts in which aerial thermography is very effective, as well as cases in which ground cover, soil composition, or the depth and character of archaeological features present challenges.

Significant in this is Lorca's relationship with anthropologist Fernando Ortiz, who regarded hybridity as foundational to post-colonial Cuban identity. For Ortiz and the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, son's hybridity is analogous to ethnic and cultural syncretism, which Ortiz likens to counterpoint, or the juxtaposition of contrasting lines in music. Syncretism and counterpoint, the core concepts of Ortiz's theory of ‘transculturation', become paradigmatic of Lorca's poem.

This study of the existing literature and of selected interviews from recent narrative corpora compares the marking of evidentiality and epistemic modality in Chuquisaca, Bolivian Quechua with its closely related variety in Cuzco, Peru and investigates three hypotheses: that morpho-syntactic attrition proceeds in reverse order of child language acquisition, that convergence characterizes the emergence of grammatical forms different from L1 and L2 in contact situations, and that the Quechua languages are undergoing typological shift toward more isolating morphology. It appears that reportive -sis disappeared first in Bolivia, with eyewitness/validator -min retaining only the validator function. This finding seems to concord with reverse acquisition since it has previously been claimed that epistemic marking is acquired earlier than evidential marking in Cuzco. Meanwhile, Spanish and Quechua in nearby Cochabamba are claimed to mark reportive evidentiality via freestanding verbs of saying.

Elmilik aligned himself with Jews and Christians who believed in the need to modernize and Europeanize Tunisia. He pursued this goal through his involvement in the local branch of the Alliance Israélite Universelle (an international Jewish organization based in Paris), his publications in a French Jewish newspaper, and his membership in a local masonic lodge. In all these arenas, he joined a chorus of European voices decrying the abuses of Jews at the hands of Tunisian government officials. But after he accepted a job working for a Tunisian government official in 1873, Elmilik began regularly defending the Tunisian state's treatment of its Jews. Rather than presume that Elmilik was a janus-faced opportunist, I argue that his different, at times opposed engagements were representative of the multiple repositories in which Jews located their rights.

Jon Sensbach's A Separate Canaan: The Making of an Afro-Moravian World in North Carolina, 1763–1840 showed how Moravians struggled with both race and slavery, ultimately concluding that Moravians adopted the racist attitudes of their non-Pietist North Carolina neighbors.

Richard Bailey's Race and Redemption in Puritan New England unraveled changing puritan ideas about race and belonging in New England.

The figurine was pierced with seven iron nails, the arms were bound behind the back, and a lead collar shackled the neck. Inscriptions on the body in the epichoric Parian alphabet suggest that the object was produced locally. The aggressive nailing, binding, shackling, inscribing, and modulation of the figurine, combined with the mortuary context and abundant parallels, suggest that the object was ritual in nature, implicated as an effigy (????ss??, Rachepuppe, or so-called voodoo doll) in a binding curse.

18816,RA-228627-15,"This article presents a remarkable cache of five Attic curse tablets, four of which are published here for the first time. Excavated in situ in a pyre-grave outside the Athenian Long Walls, the texts employ very similar versions of a single binding curse. After situating the cache in its archaeological context, all texts are edited with a full epigraphic commentary. A discussion then follows, in which the most striking features of the texts are highlighted: in addition to the peculiar ""first four-year period"" (p??t? pe??et????) that the curses were meant to outlast, and the unparalleled term ????t??, these texts are unusual in that they preserve over a full line of dactylic hexameter. The metrical formulae, combined with the presence of deictic language, may suggest that parts of the archetype curse underpinning these texts once circulated orally, in performative ritual contexts. The cache affords a singular glimpse into the process of curse-creation around 400 BCE, especially the ways in which a curse-writer could customize a fixed template spell to suit a client's needs and circumstances.

4632,HD-51106-10,"Two graphical methods of exploring aspects of cutting structure in film using shot-length data are presented. The first of these converts the cumulative frequencies of shot-lengths to tabular form that can be displayed in various ways, including the use of correspondence analysis. The method is used to investigate the differences in cutting rates used by Mack Sennett and Charlie Chaplin while directing films for the Keystone Company in 1912–14. Results suggest that previous analyses based on the average shot-length may over-simplify the contrast, and some evidence for the evolution of Sennett's style in 1913 is also suggested. The methods used, like much of the literature, do not take into account the time-series structure of the shot-lengths. In the second approach presented, this is allowed for by smoothing the time-series of shot-lengths using non-parametric regression. A computer-intensive way of presenting results graphically is developed, that does not commit the analyst to a particular choice of smoothing level, and is used to investigate an ‘hypothesis' about D. W. Griffith's cutting style suggested by a ‘prescription' for pacing implied in comments made in an article published under his name in the 1920s.

Substantial differences in values of the function ? = þ/(þ+ð) are correlated both with the division between Genesis A and B and with the boundaries of a section of Genesis A that has a source other than the Latin Bible, thus validating the approach. The ?-plot of Daniel contains an anomaly that begins at lines 362–364, precisely those lines of the poem that are paralleled in the runic inscription on the newly discovered Honington Clip, described by John Hines in this issue of Anglia (pp. 257–277). The confluence of the evidence of the archeological find, the ?-analysis, previous traditional and computer-assisted analysis, and recent art historical work by Phyllis Portnoy leads to the conclusion that both the runic inscription and lines 362–408 of Daniel derive from a lost Old English ""Song of the Three Youths"". Further investigation shows that the methods can be applied successfully to the Exeter Book poem Azarias, which shares a common ancestor with Daniel. The approach can also be extended by plotting the correlation between ? and the frequency of dental fricatives in final position in Old English texts.

4755,FN-50112-13,"There would be little adaptive value in a complex communication system like human language if there were no ways to detect and correct problems. A systematic comparison of conversation in a broad sample of the world's languages reveals a universal system for the real-time resolution of frequent breakdowns in communication. In a sample of 12 languages of 8 language families of varied typological profiles we find a system of ‘other-initiated repair', where the recipient of an unclear message can signal trouble and the sender can repair the original message. We find that this system is frequently used (on average about once per 1.4 minutes in any language), and that it has detailed common properties, contrary to assumptions of radical cultural variation. Unrelated languages share the same three functionally distinct types of repair initiator for signalling problems and use them in the same kinds of contexts. People prefer to choose the type that is the most specific possible, a principle that minimizes cost both for the sender being asked to fix the problem and for the dyad as a social unit. Disruption to the conversation is kept to a minimum, with the two-utterance repair sequence being on average no longer that the single utterance which is being fixed. The findings, controlled for historical relationships, situation types and other dependencies, reveal the fundamentally cooperative nature of human communication and offer support for the pragmatic universals hypothesis: while languages may vary in the organization of grammar and meaning, key systems of language use may be largely similar across cultural groups. They also provide a fresh perspective on controversies about the core properties of language, by revealing a common infrastructure for social interaction which may be the universal bedrock upon which linguistic diversity rests.",open access,Simeon Floyd,Journal,PLoS One,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136100,,PloS One,,,Universal Principles in the Repair of Communication Problems,2015

We discuss key formal, semantic, and pragmatic features of cross-linguistic variation concerning the use of evidential markers in interrogative clauses. Cross-linguistic data suggest that an exclusively speaker-centric view of evidentiality is not sufficient to explain the semantics of information source marking, as in many languages it is typical for evidentials in questions to represent addressee perspective.

However, Wright's blatantly commercial and blatantly evangelical model of authorship left him outside the literary mainstream.

4875,FB-56050-12,"Ethnic suburban settlement has shaped suburban landscapes in contrasting ways. On one end are ethnoburbs, where ethnic groups used spatial politics to assert their rights of ethnic expression in the landscape. On the other—less noticed—end are places where ethnic settlers arrived en masse, and their presence was scarcely visible. This article focuses on the latter, towns where ethnic suburbanites consented to existing design mores—what we term design assimilation. Using case studies from Asian American suburbs of the west and east San Gabriel Valley, we explore the history of places where Anglo design aesthetics persisted in the midst of profound demographic change. Multiple factors created and protected these landscapes, including stringent regulatory cultures of these suburbs, white political action, accommodations by builders, and Asian American consent. Asian suburbanites supported these landscapes for aesthetic, nostalgic, political, and economic reasons, including the belief that American landscape aesthetics conveyed a social distinction that positioned them above those around them—including other Asians in the ethnoburbs. Our work shows how suburban advantage has been reinforced by new waves of immigrant suburbanites, in ways that reflect the inequities and spatial expression of globalization itself. This work offers a new perspective on immigrant suburbanization and its interface with suburban ""landscapes of privilege.""",subscription,"Becky Nicolaides, James Zarsardiaz",Journal,Journal of Urban History,http://juh.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/05/0096144215610773.abstract,,Sage Publications,,,"Design Assimilation in Suburbia: Asian Americans, Built Landscapes, and Suburban Advantage in Los Angeles’s San Gabriel Valley since 1970",2015

The lessons young adults learned were derived from either direct adult prescription or by reacting to what they saw as their elders' compliance with entrenched social mores of white dominated society. Youth took their discontent with Mississippi society to the streets and institutions and infused the 1960s phase of the civil rights movement with their own brand of activism. Otha Burton described this experience as a recognition of ""knowing not only who you are but the world you live in. And maybe understanding that world. Understanding that there was a black and white America.""3 This established an awareness of racism in the black community and an increasing intolerance for allowing this separation to exist. Just as children took their lessons about navigating Mississippi society, they also took hold of their parents' and elders' activist involvement as motivating factors that propelled them into the invigorating roles youth played during the movement.",,Hayden Noel McDaniel,Journal,The Southern Quarterly Fall 2015,,,The University of Southern Mississippi College of Arts &amp; Letters,,,Growing Up Civil Rights: Youth Voices from Mississippi’s Freedom Summer,2015

Our comparison underscores significant differences, as well as similarities, that existed between them and raises analytical challenges. Understanding variability and exploring alternative methods for site interpretation are important goals for the future.

Rather than contending – as some modern scholars have – that prominent jurists developed loopholes that circumvented the original intent of the law to protect the wealthy and the ruling class, I argue that it was precisely the jurists' careful defense of exemptions and exclusions that allowed them to define the essence of zakat against forms of taxation they considered unlawful. By narrowing the scope of zakat, jurists attempted to achieve a moral aim that went beyond the ritual purification of wealth: a limit on the sultanate's otherwise arbitrary power to tax Muslims as it wished. In doing so, they alleviated some of the tax burden for spice merchants and camel herders alike.",Subscription only,Joel Blecher,Journal,Islamic Law and Society,https://doi.org/10.1163/15685195-00260A08,,Brill,,,"Scholars, Spice Traders, and Sultans: Arguing over the Alms-Tax in the Mamluk Era In: Islamic Law and Society",2021
19004,PR-258900-18,"During a routine condition survey in 2007 at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, micro-protrusions were found scattered across the surfaces of the artist's oil paintings produced between 1920 and 1950. In many of her works, including Pedernal (1941) and A Man from the Desert (1941), lead soaps were found aggregated at the painting surface, forcing the surrounding paint to deform into pin-sized protrusions. The structure and composition of the protrusions was analyzed to determine why they formed. Microsamples were removed from four of O'Keeffe's paintings and investigated using a combination of SEM–EDX, GC–MS, and FT-IR. The combined GC–MS and FT-IR results indicate that the protrusions contain primarily lead carboxylates. The results obtained for a series of ground samples removed from four different paintings were then compared with samples collected from a commercially pre-primed canvas roll found in the artist's house in Ghost Ranch, NM. We identified two different types of canvases: i) a commercially pre-primed canvas and ii) artist primed canvas. This commercially pre-primed canvas roll has a similar morphology to the ground layers in her paintings that contain protrusions additionally these grounds were found to contain an excess of free fatty acids and metal carboxylates (lead soaps) based on a comparison to canvases the artist primed herself. Based on the analytical results from the four paintings and the commercial pre-primed canvas, we concluded that the artist's use of this particular commercially pre-primed canvas between 1920 and 1950 play an important role in the observed micro-protrusions.",open access,"Annette S.

19007,PR-258900-18,"A significant number of oil paintings produced by Georgia O'Keeffe (1887–1986) show surface protrusions of varying width, up to several hundreds of microns. These protrusions are similar to those described in the art conservation literature as metallic soaps. Since the presence of these protrusions raises questions about the state of conservation and long-term prospects for deterioration of these artworks, a 3D-imaging technique, photometric stereo using ultraviolet illumination, was developed for the long-term monitoring of the surface shape of the protrusions and the surrounding paint. Because the UV fluorescence response of painting materials is isotropic, errors typically caused by non-Lambertian (anisotropic) specularities when using visible reflected light can be avoided providing a more accurate estimation of shape. As an added benefit, fluorescence provides additional contrast information contributing to material characterization. The developed methodology aims to detect, characterize, and quantify the distribution of micro-protrusions and their development over the surface of entire artworks. Combined with a set of analytical in situ techniques, and computational tools, this approach constitutes a novel methodology to investigate the selective distribution of protrusions in correlation with the composition of painting materials at the macroscale. While focused on O'Keeffe's paintings as a case study, we expect the proposed approach to have broader significance by providing a non-invasive protocol to the conservation community to probe topological changes for any relatively flat painted surface of an artwork, and more specifically to monitor the dynamic formation of protrusions, in relation to paint composition and modifications of environmental conditions, loans, exhibitions, and storage over the long term.",subscription only,"Johanna Salvant, Marc Walton, Dale Kronkright, Chia-Kai Yeh, Fengqiang Li, Oliver Cossairt",Journal,Part of the Cultural Heritage Science book series (CUHESC),https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90617-1 22,,Springer,,,Photometric Stereo by UV-Induced Fluorescence to Detect Protrusions on Georgia O’Keeffe’s Paintings,2019

In doing so, the essay turns to Paul Laurence Dunbar's grievously understudied 1901 novel The Fanatics, a historical fiction of the war years that focuses on the white North and argues that the Unionists who battled the Confederacy did so only because they wrongly believed that the war's purpose had nothing to do with enslaved Black Americans. The essay also shows how Dunbar's novel contributes to several fields of contemporary intellectual interest, among them Civil War studies, Afropessimist thought, and a cross-disciplinary investigation of negative epistemologies known as ""ignorance studies.""

In comparison, human interments that predate the Natufian are rare. The discovery and excavation of a hut structure at the 20,000-year-old Epipalaeolithic site of Kharaneh IV in eastern Jordan reveals the remains of an adult female intentionally placed in a semi-flexed position on one of the structure's floors. The structure was burned down shortly after her deposition, extensively charring the human remains. The burying of the dead within structures and the burning of domestic structures are well-known from later Neolithic periods, although their combination as a mortuary practice is rare. However, for the Early Epipalaeolithic, the burning of a structure containing the primary deposition of human remains is novel and signifies an early appearance for the intentional burning of bodies as a mortuary treatment and symbolic behaviors associated with the interrelated life histories of structures and people.",Subscription,"Lisa A.

With the growing use of geometric morphometrics in archaeology, it is important to understand and identify limitations in the method. One such limitation is the accumulation of measurement error. Here, we investigate the impact of parallax or the effect of the position of an object in relation to the camera. We designed an experiment to assess the effect of parallax on measurements of artifact morphology by photographing a sample of artifacts at close range (50 cm) and systematically shifting the fixed angle of the camera relative to the artifact in five steps: 90°, 95°, 100°, 105°, and 110°. We took digital images of geometric microliths from three Jordanian Epipalaeolithic sites at each of the camera angles. We then digitized the outline of each artifact using 24 sliding landmarks. Our subsequent analyses of microlith shapes grouped by camera angle show that they are statistically indistinguishable from each other, which suggests that within these parameters, parallax has little effect on geometric morphometric measurements. While taking digital images directly above artifacts is ideal, the angle at which previously published photographs of artifacts is sometimes unknown. Our findings suggest that small deviations of the camera angle (up to 20° from horizontal) will not significantly impact geometric morphometric analyses.",Subscription,"Danielle A.

In North Indian vernaculars, to ask who feels gh??a (disgust) towards whom is often to trace the boundaries of the touchable body politic. Gh??a karna – doing disgust – describes a set of practices often identical to those known in a political register as ‘practices of untouchability.' Thus, ve ham se gh??a karte hain (‘they are disgusted by us,' or, better, ‘they practice disgust on us') is among the more common ways that Dalits describe their treatment at the hands of privileged castes. This article tracks usages of gh??a in two vernacular North Indian sources from the early twentieth century in order to throw critical light on the inculcation of disgust as advantaged and disadvantaged caste observers have described it. In Hindi tracts composed by members of the Hindu reformist organization the Arya Samaj, gh??a appears as an impediment to the majoritarian project of Hindu encompassment of its erstwhile ‘untouchable' other; Arya Samajist polemicists seek to expose Hindu disgust towards Dalits and to redirect it towards new targets. In oral traditions that circulated among Dalit castes engaged in sanitation labour in the late colonial period, parables of encounter between ‘touchable' and ‘untouchable' give utterance to a critique of gh??a as antithetical to moral action and as opposed to life.

A key aspect of this study was the accurate, but selective, documentation of the ravine's anthropogenic elements, and the delineation of these premodern and modern phases. Rather than using laser scanning or other technologies more often used for large features, the project generated a high definition photogrammetric model and associated vector drawings by a modified protocol using a handheld camera.

This two-day ceremony demonstrates that prevailing scholarly perceptions of death and what follows it in Hindu traditions have constrained our ability to appreciate other models for ritual relationships between the living and the dead. These vernacular rituals call the dead back into the world, convince them to possess a human host, and persuade them to be permanently installed in the family's domestic shrine so they may protect and sustain living kin. Rather than aiming to irrevocably separate the dead from the living, these rites are instead oriented toward eventual conjunction with the dead and therefore reveal a fundamentally different picture than that articulated in the majority of Hinduism's sacred texts and scholarly accounts",,Amy Allocco,Journal,Journal of the American Academy of Religion,https://academic.oup.com/jaar/article/89/1/103/6248160,Journal of the American Academy of Religion web site,Oxford University Press,,,Bringing the Dead Home: Hindu Invitation Rituals in Tamil South India,2021

Different cultural views of poverty contributed to how policy makers envisioned anti-poverty reforms. Danish elites articulated social investments in peasants as necessary to economic growth, political stability and societal strength. British elites viewed the lower classes as a challenge to these goals. The French perceived the poor as an opportunity for Christian charity. Fiction writers are overlooked political agents who engage in policy struggles. Collectively, writers contribute to a country's distinctive ‘cultural constraint', or symbols and narratives, which appears in the national-level aggregation of literature.

Theories accounting for industrial relations systems (economic structure, power resources, and party/electoral systems) have difficulty accounting for the similarities among these cases. Therefore, we explore the historical depictions of labor appearing in literature to evaluate whether cross-national distinctions in cultural conceptions of labor have some correspondence to distinctions between coordinated and liberal industrial relations systems. We hypothesize that historical literary depictions of labor are associated with the evolution of industrial systems, and apply computational text analyses to large corpora of literary texts. We find that countries (Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands) with coordinated, corporatist industrial relations in the 20th century share similar cultural constructions about labor relations dating back to at least 1770.

But (there's always a ""but"", isn't there?) … it's called a challenge grant for a reason. The challenge requires a threeto- one match.

The good news (there's always ""good news"" too, isn't there?) … the generosity of donors exceeded what we needed to raise by the end of July 2020, making more than $158,000 in NEH funds available to help pay for the security and access upgrades that have now been completed, and for the upcoming installation of a new chiller and cooling tower.

Augmented reality, when leveraged properly, has been demonstrated to be an efficacious instructional vehicle across many academic domains, but little is known about its relationship to motivation and situational interest. Additionally, little empirical research has been performed on augmented reality applications related to the specific domain of history. Merely knowing that a technology, like augmented reality, can produce positive learning outcomes is not enough; understanding how it impacts motivation and situational interest are critical in understanding how and when to leverage this technology. This study analyzed the impact to situational interest and motivation using an augmented reality application that delivers instructional content about the tragic events that occurred on May 4th, 1970 at Kent State University. Using both a qualitative and a quantitative pretest and posttest approach, it was determined that situational interest and motivation were impacted by AR. More specifically, aspects of motivation decreased while situational and content knowledge increased. Through a qualitative approach, this study outlined factors that contributed to these changes.

Based on the evidence included in Viceroy Toledo's 1570 investigation about the judicial endeavors of the Huanca group, I have shown that traditional mechanisms for allocating labor tasks and, after the Spanish conquest, apportioning tribute quotas among different ayllu underscored community-wide litigation and the search for favor at local and metropolitan courts, thus subjecting this type of legal initiative to the social rules, practices, and expectations governing sapci (communal) endowments and funds. The possibility of evaluating the performance of pueblo and multi-pueblo authorities in charge of collective resources and holding these leaders accountable for any mismanagement or misappropriation of sapci legal funds was embedded in the planning and assessment of collective action that khipu devices facilitated. These twin processes conferred a moderate, yet previously overlooked degree of control in legal strategies and decisions to mid-ranking ayllu and cabildo authorities and, ultimately, to the Andean commoners who were directly involved in the reproduction of sapci regimes.",Subscription,"De la Puente Luna, José Carlos",Journal,The Americas,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/tam.2014.4,,Cambridge University Press,,,"That Which Belongs to All: Khipus, Community, and Indigenous Legal Activism in the Early Colonial Andes",2015

Our dataset confirms the value of a multi-pronged approach when establishing ceramic typologies from survey datasets, incorporating distribution in the landscape with macroscopic, microscopic (petrographic), and chemical (Instrumental Neutron Activation) analyses. Our results offer valuable insights into continuity as well as change of ceramic recipes in western Anatolia during the rise of urbanism in the Middle to Late Bronze Age followed by the establishment of an imperial realm in the Iron Age.

Mainstream Israeli media and political narratives often say that the Palestinian parents sacrificed their children in the name of religion. Some of this misunderstanding comes in response to the Palestinian mothers who memorialize their sons' death as beautiful and an act of strength. However, a reading of the mothers' narratives that is grounded in memory studies and contemporary Palestinian history disrupts the notion the Palestinians embrace ‘an industry of death.' The mothers recall the death as an honorable sacrifice for Palestine to not only find individual solace from a traumatic past, but also to share in a collective narrative with national meanings.

5239,RA-50040-06,"This article inquires into the work of modern minority discourse and politics that delineates the boundaries of the Turkish national subject as Turkish-Islamic. It argues that the Turkish minority concept, which is based on imaginaries that justify claims of national and religious sameness and difference, needs to be understood against the backdrop of its historical formation. In the late Ottoman Empire, the socio-political grounds of communal sameness/difference were radically transformed. In this process, ethno-religious millets turned into national millets, culminating in the re-conceptualization of the non-Muslim millets as religious minorities in the early Republic of Turkey. The article further shows how the restriction of minority rights to non-Muslims puts the Turkish concept of minority/azinlik at odds with international conventions on minority discourse. It creates ambivalences with regard to citizenship and nationhood status not only for them, but also for disadvantaged Muslim subgroups, such as the Alevis. Drawing in particular on the case of the Alevi community, I will demarcate the contested entry and exit points of nationhood and religion, in relation to which the minority label is organized in Turkey. Having to negotiate the pitfalls of Turkish identity discourses, Alevis employ the semantics of international human rights discourse in their quest for equal rights and recognition, while rejecting the minority label.",open source,Markus Dressler,Journal,"New Diversities 17 (2015):  Engaging with the Other:  Religion, Identity, and Politics in the Mediterranean",http://newdiversities.mmg.mpg.de/?page id=1644,"Link to article.

Yet, during the sixteenth century, and especially after their expulsion from Spain in 1609, Constantinople became an important node in the Moriscos' Mediterranean-wide network. Unlike other intermediaries active on the diplomatic scene of Constantinople, Moriscos had a special role in sultanic image-making during the age of increased confessional polarization in both Europe and parts of the Middle East, between the mid-sixteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries. The essay examines how European and Ottoman sources represented Moriscos as both subjects and objects of Ottoman diplomacy, explores the significance of their religious affiliation in the diplomatic process, and argues that the Moriscos' mediation provided the Ottomans with valuable opportunities to exploit confessional tensions and articulate their claims to sovereignty to their European interlocutors.",open source,Tijana Krstic,Journal,"Journal of Early Modern History ",http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15700658-12342454,"Link to article.

This is striking, I think, because experimental or creative thought is not often enough attributed to legal clerks, civil servants, or scribes in any language or century. I have been interested in ""office creativity"" because many late-medieval writers were bureaucrats by day and ""moonlighted"" as literary authors or scribes after hours: cases such as Geoffrey Chaucer's, Thomas Usk's, Thomas Hoccleve's, John Audelay's, and, from internal evidence, likely William Langland's, are already well known. Contributing to this ferment, though more rarely identifiable, are the members of the ""clerical proletariat"" who also migrated to offices: the army of the underemployed, originally trained for the medieval church but not able to attain benefices in it (Hoccleve himself being among the identifiable).

With their clerical skills, well-educated office employees (to which we can add ""king's clerks,"" notaries, attorneys, and household secretaries) were often not just copying but drafting, creating or intervening in texts and affairs with skill and agenda.",,Kathryn Kerby-Fulton,Journal,Speculum,,,The University of Chicago Press,,,"Competing Archives, Competing Languages: Office Vernaculars, Civil Servant Raconteurs, and the Porous Nature of French during Ireland’s Rise of English",2015

In the application of face recognition technology to photographed human faces, a number of difficulties are inherent in a real or perceived alteration of appearance of the face through variations in facial expression, age, angle of pose, and so on.  With works of portrait art, not only do all these problems pertain, but these works also have their own additional challenges.  Most notably, portrait art does not provide what might be called a photographic likeness but rather one that goes through a process of visual interpretation on the part of the artist.  After establishing the initial parameters of the application of this technology, the main goal of FACES has been to test the ability of the FACES algorithm to restore lost identities to works of portrait art, something our research has shown is clearly feasible.

To understand how those patterns of preference changed across a century, we gathered two samples of English-language poetry, 1820-1919: one drawn from volumes reviewed in prominent periodicals, and one selected at random from a large digital library (where the majority of authors are relatively obscure). The stylistic differences associated with literary prominence turn out to be quite stable: a statistical model trained to distinguish reviewed from random volumes in any quarter of this century can make predictions almost as accurate about the rest of the period. The ""poetic revolutions"" described by many histories are not visible in this model — instead we see a steady tendency for new volumes of poetry to change by slightly exaggerating certain features that defined prestige in the recent past.",Subscription plus green open access after publication.,"Underwood, Ted, Sellers, Jordan",Journal,,,,Modern Language Quarterly,,,The Longue Durée of Literary Prestige,2016

More specifically, it maps out a framework for defining and theorizing chemical rhetoric through three, interconnected lenses: historical-ecological, conceptual articulation, and vernacular.

19878,FEL-262747-19,"Few of the works reviewed here refer to capitalism as such. That seems to be the territory of historians, and more specifically of historians responding to the global turn.1 But the historians, economic historians, and historically informed sociologists and political scientists included in this review do provide histories of Latin American capitalist development and of the impact of the region's integration to the global economy, from sixteenth-century silver capitalism to the most recent soy-driven orientation to China. Reading as an intellectual historian of development and capitalism in Latin America, specifically of ""dependency theory"" writ large, I find continuity and legacies as well as ruptures in these books' approach to the study of Latin American capitalist development.2 Latin American studies have a rich and long tradition of thinking both historically and globally about capitalist development. The recent scholarship draws from that tradition while moving away from the implied assumptions and perhaps unintended implications of the dependency-theory-inspired narratives of old.3 However, unlike the previous generation of scholars, the works under review highlight Latin American states, entrepreneurs, municipal councils, and peasants ""carrying""—to borrow one of the terms discussed below—capitalism rather than being carried or crushed. In particular, the twentieth-century development era, with its promises and legacies, appears for the most part in a new light, especially when looking at Brazil, which also appears prominently in this selection. The change in emphasis is perhaps the result of the comparison with the neoliberal era and its failure to promote either development or equality, with the exception of the short-lived commodity boom in the first decade of the twenty-first century. The question of persistent and perhaps even growing inequality, not just as an obstacle for development as in the past but as a problem in and of itself is key.",,Margarita Fajardo,Journal,Latin American Research Review,,,,,,"Capitalism, Inequality, and Development in Latin America",2021

The function is the creation and maintenance of what I call imaginative expectations, which are relatively stable imaginative representations of future events or experiences, analogous to latent memories.

20049,HAA-271747-20,"Handwritten character recognition is a challenging pattern recognition problem due to the inconsistency of the handwritten scripts and the lack of accurate labeled data. Historical documents written in cursive are even more challenging as characters have unique and varying shapes. Frequently, words are linked by lines and ornamental doodles. When historical documents are digitized, the images contain various types of noise and degradation, which further complicates the recognition of characters. In this paper, we present an empirical study of how well state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification perform for the task of recognizing handwritten characters in seventeenth-century Spanish American notarial scripts. Professional historians, paleography experts and trained labelers were involved in preparing the labeled dataset of Spanish characters for training the CNNs.1 The labeled dataset used in this experiment was created from the manuscripts written by one of the multiple scribes that contributed to the collection of approximately 220,000 digitized images of notary records housed at the Archivo General de la Nación Argentina (National Archives). We removed the noise in these images by applying standard image processing techniques. After training different CNNs, we computed the classification accuracy for all the characters. We observed that ResNet-50 achieved a promising accuracy of 97.08% compared to InceptionResnet-V2, Inception-V3, and VGG-16, which achieved 96.66%, 96.33% and 70.91%, respectively.",Open Access,"Nouf Alrasheed, Viviana Grieco, Praveen Rao",Journal,Digital Humanities Quarterly,http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/,,Digital Humanities Quarterly 15.4,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xD4y6otD35vkZmkYUwKPUL9Pz-C9qTLM/view,,Character Recognition of Seventeenth Century Spanish American Notary Records Using Deep Learning,2021

20070,PD-266994-19,"Languages differ with respect to if and how they categorize their nouns based on specific lexical or grammatical criteria. A well-studied example is the mass/count distinction, which groups nouns according to their ability to be counted or measured. Cross-linguistic comparison on this noun-categorization system provided evidence that the mass/count distinction is not a reflection of pre-linguistic perceptions, rather it is a language internal grammatical distinction showing how countability and measurability can be grammatically encoded on different nouns. This work focuses on how the mass/count distinction surfaces in the grammar of Nadëb (Naduhup family; ISO 639-3: mbj) – an endangered and under-described indigenous language of Northwest-Amazonia (Brazil). Results from Lima and Rothstein's (2016) ""The count/mass distinction questionnaire"" show that the ability (or inability) to be syntactically juxtaposed with a numeral expression is one of the cut-off points for the division of mass and count nouns in Nadëb.

20076,PW-264175-19,"Smaller corpora and individual pieces are compared to a large corpus of 2,447 hymns using two measures of melodic angularity: mean interval size and pivot frequency. European art music and West African melodies may exhibit extreme angularity. We argue in the latter that angularity is motivated by linguistic features of tone-level languages. We also found the mean interval sizes of African-American Spirituals and Southern Harmony exceed contemporary hymnody of the 19th century, with levels similar to Nigerian traditional music (Yorùbá oríkì and story songs from eastern Nigeria). This is consistent with the account of W. E. B. Du Bois, who argued that African melody was a primary source for the development of American music. The development of the American spiritual coincides with increasing interval size in 19th-century American hymnody at large, surpassing the same measure applied to earlier European hymns. Based on these findings, we recommend techniques of melodic construction taught by music theorists, especially preference rules for step-wise motion and gap-fill after leaps, be tempered with counterexamples that reflect broader musical aesthetics. This may be achieved by introducing popular music, African and African Diaspora music, and other non-Western music that may or may not be consistent with voice leading principles. There are also many examples from the European canon that are highly angular, like Händel's ""Hallelujah"" and Schönberg's Pierrot Lunaire.

20167,FA-55761-11,"This essay seeks to re-interpret both the gendered rhetoric of the First Red Scare as well as the reasons why many feminists came under attack in the years following World War I. It underscores the ways in which women's activist concerns were de-legitimized through accusations of Bolshevism, but also highlights the very real attractions that the Soviet system held for American women seeking peace, economic independence, voting rights, professional opportunity, and sexual freedom. Although a number of historians have demonstrated the ways in which a focus upon gender and women offers important insights into the First Red Scare, they have given only minimal attention to the Soviet Union's appeal, presumably wishing to avoid giving credence to inflammatory and exaggerated right-wing rhetoric. However, this tendency has the effect of distorting the historical record and, in particular, of eliding revolutionary Russia's role in fostering the American feminist imagination. Attention to several prominent targets of the First Red Scare, including Louise Bryant, Emma Goldman, and Rose Pastor Stokes, helps to clarify these dynamics.",Subscription only,Julia L.

20171,FA-57426-13,"The effect of World War I on Freud is well known, yet its relation to ""The Uncanny"" (1919) remains mysterious. Although scholars have mentioned the war's atmospheric effect, I ask: What if the connection to ""The Uncanny"" is more essential and profound, as exemplified by the essay's many implicit references to the war: its recalling of the return of the fallen and of burial alive in the trenches; of a 1917 British story about trauma in colonial New Guinea; and, through ""The Sandman,"" of E.T.A. Hoffmann's own experiences of shock during the Napoleonic Wars? The fact that Freud does not connect these traumas directly to ""uncanniness"" speaks to the problem they pose – for him and for psychoanalytic theory in general. This silence creates an uncanny effect within the essay itself: ""The Uncanny"" stages the same ""return of the repressed"" that it diagnoses. I aim, first, to delineate this staging and, later, propose its conceptual relevance. The shadow of the war forces us to understand the ""uncanny"" differently: not just as a personal trauma but as a social symptom of the repression of this suffering. The real horror of the uncanny, Freud's essay teaches us, is not our own but the other's trauma – as embodied in wartime Europe by the ""war neurotic"" and his apparently contagious affliction.",subscription only,John Zilcosky,Journal,Psychoanalysis and History,https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/10.3366/pah.2018.0257,,Edinburgh University Press,,,"""'The Times in Which We Live': Freud's 'The Uncanny,' World War I, and the Trauma of Contagion.""",2018

The syncope and truncation sound changes proposed by Ross and Næss are reinterpreted as emergent from prosodic effects, and as a result of closer study of other sound changes, we find that the hypothesized Utupua–Vanikoro branch is not phonologically well founded. A second merger of sounds in Proto-Oceanic, in addition to the one presented in Ross and Næss, is uncovered for all of Temotu languages, giving support for its acceptance as a subgroup of Oceanic.

More recent analyses have accepted the premise that the motet's form has extramusical meaning, in particular, that mensural and architectural proportions can be directly analogized. These tantalizing connections have led scholars to canonize this motet, now a mainstay of music history textbooks. The extent and specificity of the extramusical associations Nuper rosarum flores enjoys—an occasion, a place, and a secure attribution—are rare in the fifteenth century. This fact alone makes the motet appear to be exceptional. But reading Nuper rosarum flores alongside the norms of genre and notation and against the grain of the work's modern historiography suggests that it isn't all that special—or at least that it is no more special than Du Fay's other ceremonial motets. The interpretive history of Nuper rosarum flores exemplifies what I call ""false exceptionalism,"" which relates to a more general problem in music studies—the alluring but often elusive relationship between musical form and social meaning.",,Emily Zazulia,Journal,Journal of Musicology,https://online.ucpress.edu/jm/article/36/2/131/63581/Out-of-ProportionNuper-rosarum-flores-and-the,,University of California Press,,,Out of Proportion: Nuper rosarum flores and the Danger of False Exceptionalism,2019

This switch is demanded by two texts that bear a number of thematic and conceptual similarities and were published months apart in 1928: Mário de Andrade's Macunaíma and Virginia Woolf 's Orlando. Both works rethink Darwinism's import for national representation by adapting the genre of the national romance or prose epic.

20221,FT-248702-16,"George Rochberg often attributed his postmodern shift to the death of his son in 1964. Accordingly, the literature has described his practice of ars combinatoria (""art of combination"") as an ""abrupt about-face""—a sudden rejection of modernist aesthetics. But the composer's unpublished essays, diaries, correspondence, and musical sketchbooks suggest that the road to ars combinatoria had well-laid roots in two of his least considered biographical periods: his service during World War II and his serial period. During these two decades, Rochberg actively sought positive models for humanistic composition, historical figures who rose to the level of musical heroes in that they served humanity through their art. But as the war had taught him, heroes are necessarily defined by their struggle against nemeses in ethical conflicts. Correspondingly, he constructed the other side of the artistic world as a realm of vain egoists who sought self-promotion and seemed unconcerned with humanistic modes of expression. As his ideas matured, Rochberg assigned different figures to these archetypes, but the guiding ethical criteria remained fairly consistent throughout. I therefore argue that ars combinatoria was less a sudden aesthetic reversal than it was the result of a longer cumulative process of self-assessment and compositional maturation.",,Amy Lynn Wlodarski,Journal,Journal of the Society for American Music,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-society-for-american-music/issue/7761D45421584FC9B8C12D0B5668E4F1,Journal Issue Webpage,Cambridge University Press,,,"George Rochberg's Road to Are Combinatoria, 1943–63",2018

Although still in the start-up phase, it already is capable of identifying significant numbers of known allusions, as well as similar numbers of allusions previously unnoticed by scholars. In this article, we use the tool to examine allusions to Vergil's Aeneid in the first book of Lucan's Civil War. Approximately 3,000 lin- guistic parallels returned by the program were compared with a list of known allusions drawn from commentaries. Each was examined individually and graded for its literary significance, in order to benchmark the program's performance. All allusions from the program and commentaries were then pooled in order to examine broad patterns in Lucan's allusive techniques which were largely unapproachable without digital methods. Although Lucan draws relatively con- stantly from Vergil's generic language in order to maintain the epic idiom, this baseline is punctuated by clusters of pointed allusions, in which Lucan frequently subverts Vergil's original meaning. These clusters not only attend the most sig- nificant characters and events but also play a role in structuring scene transitions.

This article describes an approach for detect- ing the sorts of intertexts that literary scholars have found most meaningful, as embodied in the free Tesserae website http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/. Tests of Tesserae Versions 1 and 2 showed that word-level n-gram matching could recall a majority of parallels identified by scholarly commentators in a benchmark set. But these versions lacked precision, so that the meaningful parallels could be found only among long lists of those that were not meaningful. The Version 3 search described here adds a second stage scoring system that sorts the found parallels by a formula accounting for word frequency and phrase density. Testing against a benchmark set of intertexts in Latin epic poetry shows that the scoring system overall succeeds in ranking parallels of greater significance more highly, allowing site users to find meaningful parallels more quickly. Users can also choose to adjust both recall and precision by focusing only on results above given score levels. As a theoretical matter, these tests establish that lemma iden- tity, word frequency, and phrase density are important constituents of what make a phrase parallel a meaningful intertext.",subscription,"Forstall, Christopher W., Coffee, Neil, Buck, Thomas, Roache, Katherine, Jacobson, Sarah",Journal,Literary and Linguistic Computing,,,Literary and Linguistic Computing,,,Modeling the Scholars: Detecting Intertextuality through Enhanced Word-Level N-Gram Matching,2014

By the mid eighteenth century, English-speaking inhabitants from the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and the Colombian islands of San Andrés and Old Providence took to the sea in search of green and hawksbill turtles. In doing so, they created a robust maritime commerce and distinctive seafaring culture, which continues to exist in these communities.

Digital curating, in particular, allows for greater audience participation, both by expanding the potential audience and by allowing visitors to navigate through the virtual galleries under their own direction. We contend that by facilitating the site visitors' creation of their own visual arguments, a new level of audience participation in visual analysis — indeed, in a fundamental intellectual and intuitive aspect of curating — is made possible.

At the same time, it offered a new social and cultural space in which to negotiate the often contradictory meanings of marketable property. This work of making the property market meaningful is told through institutional archives, published accounts, diaries, and estate correspondence.",Subscription Only,Desmond Fitz-Gibbon,Journal,Journal of British Studies,,,Cambridge University Press,,,"The London Auction Mart and the Marketability of Real Estate in England, 1808-1864",2016

10034,FB-52344-06,"One of the most popular and long-lived approaches to naturalizing the mind is the attempt to reduce mental phenomena to physical, biological, or neural phenomena. Reductionism has held a special allure among philosophers for a number of reasons: the intuitive appeal of part-whole explanations, reductive explanation's resemblance to the axiomatic method in mathematics, its apparent promise as a strategy for unifying different knowledge domains, and the fact that true reductions, when successful, are almost unique in yielding both metaphysical necessity and complete explanations. Reductionism was a very influential view in philosophy of science, both in early modernity and through much of the twentieth century, and some central contemporary issues in philosophy of mind -- the explanatory gap and the hard problem of consciousness -- are framed as claims that conscious mental states (and perhaps they alone) are not reducible to physical phenomena. In fact, however, most philosophers of science today would agree that true intertheoretic reductions are rare even in the natural sciences. I propose an explanation of both the appeal and the failure of reductionism in terms of a cognitivist approach to philosophy of science called Cognitive Pluralism, and then explore what implications post-reductionist philosophy of science has for philosophy of mind. If it is ""explanatory gaps all the way down,"" what are the implications for dualism and for reductive, non-reductive and eliminative physicalisms? Is the mind-matter gap different than other explanatory gaps? And, if the Cognitive Pluralist analysis is correct, is there any hope more generally for a unified science, or that scientific theories generally can provide answers to metaphysical questions?",Subscription,Steven Horst,Journal,Mind &amp; Matter,http://www.mindmatter.de/journal/issues/mmissue12 2.html,Page for journal issue.,Mind and Matter,https://www.academia.edu/9979319/Beyond Reduction From Naturalism to Cognitive Pluralism,Article at author's Academia.edu site,Beyond Reduction: From Naturalism to Cognitive Pluralism,2014

10047,FB-55612-11,"This essay examines the nexus of the court (darbar), monastery (ma?ha) and temple (devasthanam) through the career of the monastic leader, Vyasatirtha (1460–1539). Vyasatirtha was head of the Madhva Brahmin sect under successive Vijayanagara emperors, most notably, Krishnadevaraya (r. 1509–1529). He is famous for his doc- trinal polemics against alternative forms of Vedanta advanced by rival sects and in favour of his own system of thought often called ‘Dvaita' or ‘Dualist' Vedanta. Vyasatirtha's fame as a polemicist is linked directly to his role as an institutional leader, overseeing a network of sectarian monasteries that was significantly expanded by Krishnadevaraya's patronage. In this capacity, Vyasatirtha was both an agent of the Vijayanagara state and a powerful regional authority. Inscriptional and literary sources indicate that Vyasatirtha used royal patronage of his sect to forge productive relation- ships with a variety of social groups, simultaneously expanding the Empire's economic and social networks and spreading Madhva Brahminism into new territories. Thus, studying Vyasatirtha's role as a ma?hadhipati, or the head of a monastic institutional network, illuminates key connections between Brahmin intellectual and religious activity and various socio-political formations of early sixteenth-century South India.

10061,FA-53232-07,"Economic historians, beginning with Avner Greif, have looked to business letters from the Cairo Geniza to understand how medieval merchants in the Islamic Mediterranean organized business collaboration. They have noticed the prevalence of agency relations, which followed ""informal"" arrangements, unlike formal partnerships, which employed written contracts. This ""method"" was called s?uh?ba (""companionship"") in Arabic, and it entailed reciprocal exchange of favors between business ""friends."" Much attention has been given to what Greif calls ""private order"" enforcement of agency contracts, whereby merchants belonging to a ""closed"" consortium reported instances of cheating or opportunism by a fellow merchant, in place of enforcement by religious courts. However, economic historians relying on the Geniza documents have paid inadequate attention to evolving Jewish law in the Islamic milieu. The present article, focusing on a mercantile dispute, brings evidence to show that Jewish legal scholars adopted a feature of Islamic judicial practice to strengthen their role in enforcement of informal agency contracts.

Interested in the lived experiences of all enslaved people, I move beyond the military conflict between rebel leaders and colonial slave owners on which historians most often focus. Using the unusually rich records generated in Berbice over more than a year of insurgency, I argue that the rebellion did not encompass all enslaved people in the colony, but was the work of a determined minority who used coercion, including re-enslavement, to get others to join. Many enslaved Berbicians were neither purposeful rebels nor committed collaborators or loyalists. Eager to stay alive and preserve their independence once slavery was overthrown, such people, many of them women, struggled to dodge both the Dutch and the rebels. A focus on the internal politics of rebellion, or the struggle over who will rule at home, reveals that as an emancipatory process, armed rebellion was profoundly gendered, hierarchical, and exacerbated existing divisions within the enslaved community. For many, agency in rebellion consisted of accommodation and self-preservation, rather than outright rebellion.",open access,"Kars, Marjoleine",Journal,American Historical Review,,,Oxford University Press,,,"“Dodging Rebellion: Women and a Politics of Gender in the Berbice Slave Rebellion,”",2016

By negotiating the distance between his own sense of self and the perceptions of North American jazz musicians and critics, Barbieri developed a distinctive musical persona. Engaging with the highly politicized free jazz movement and with novel forms of protest jazz, Barbieri articulated Latin-ness as an irreducible difference and an implicit critique of white, North American power and privilege. Since he had no interest or expertise in Latin American music until after he left Argentina, it makes little sense to see him as the bearer of a Latin musical tradition. On the contrary, his musical innovations were the result of the agency he was able to exercise within global structures in which Latin America was associated with exotic, earthy rhythms and with values such as passion and sensuality. At the same time, these associations also limited the ideological challenge posed by his music: Barbieri eventually embraced conventional musical signifiers and thereby reinforced North American stereotypes about Latin identity.",,Matthew B.

Nonnormative uses of ‘reason' are taken as basic, and as meaning explanation why.  Talk about normative reasons for action is analyzed in terms of explanations why acting would be good in some way.  I show how a number of obstacles for this idea—including extending the analysis to normative reasons for attitudes—can be overcome by adopting a reductive, end-relational analysis of the meaning of ‘good' which I have defended elsewhere.

10168,FT-58197-10,"Within Jean Cocteau's varied oeuvre, we find a number of human-animal hybrid characters: The sphinx and a centaur-like horseman first appear in the plays ""La Machine Infernale"" and ""Orphée,"" respectively and then reappear in Cocteau's final film, Le Testament d'Orphée. These creatures are depicted in the framework of the well-known myths of Orpheus and Oedipus, yet Cocteau incorporates them in ways that surprise and destabilize the spectator.  &#x0D; Another, more famous hybrid creature manifests in La Belle et la bête, as the Beast is both human and animal, just not at the same time. His animal ferocity masks la Bête's inner beauty, much as the elaborate beastly mask conceals the physical beauty of actor Jean Marais. The enduring character of la Bête, perhaps Cocteau's best-known creation, is in a liminal state that inspires first fear, but later affection and even love. As in the original narrative by Madame Leprince de Beaumont, la Belle is confused by the appearance of Prince Charming after having declared her love for la Bête; it is the animal that she loves, not the human before her. This paper examines Cocteau's early depictions of human-animal figures in his theatrical works and films, then focuses on la Bête as a profound depiction of hybridity.",,Catherine Webster,Journal,Contemporary French and Francophone Studies:  Sites,http://sites.uconn.edu/volume-17-issue-3/,Website for Sites Journal,Contemporary French and 	Francophone Studies:  	Sites,https://www.worldcat.org/title/la-belle-est-la-bete-cocteaus-hybrid-human-animals/oclc/5136113756&amp;referer=brief results,downloadable article from worldcat,“La Belle est la bête:  Cocteau's hybrid human-animals.”,2013

We defend the opposing view that ‘ought' always expresses a propositional operator against objections that it cannot adequately accommodate an ambiguity in ‘ought' sentences between evaluative and deliberative readings, predicting readings of sentences that are not actually available.  We show how adopting an independently well-motivated contrastivist semantics for ‘ought' according to which ‘ought' is always relativized to a contrast set of relevant alternatives enables us to explain the evaluative-deliberative ambiguity and why the availability of these readings depends on sentential grammar.",Subscription only journal; preprint version open access on author's website,"Justin Snedegar, Stephen Finlay",Journal,Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00646.x/abstract;jsessionid=58BF345C01765BAE9D5DDBDD3817C35E.f01t01,Journal access (subscription only),Wiley,http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~finlay/,Author's open access website (preprint version),"""One Ought Too Many""",2014

Constituting a vast population of so-called ""dark tourists,"" these travelers are frequently characterized by researchers as consumers of macabre spectacles, susceptible to sensationalized and inauthentic representations of historical events. But does Holocaust tourism automatically position its participants as naïve consumers of a commodified version of history? Based on field research conducted at numerous sites of Holocaust remembrance, this article considers how Holocaust tourists exercise agency, especially through the practice of photography. Through such agency, tourists to Holocaust memorial sites become active producers of historical knowledge as they generate their own representations of historical trauma. Ultimately, Holocaust tourists reflect on the authentic and inauthentic dimensions of their experiences, hold tourist sites accountable for the representations on display, and become stewards of collective memory.",,Daniel Reynolds,Journal,Journal of Consumer Culture,http://joc.sagepub.com/,Web Portal for Journal of Consumer Culture,Journal of Consumer Culture 16 (July 2016) 334-353.,,,Consumer or Witnesses?

Kinky empiricism takes established forms to an extreme and turns back to reflect on its own conditions of possibility. At the same time, it deploys methods that create obligations, obligations that compel those who seek knowledge to put themselves on the line by making truth claims that they know will intervene within the settings and among the people they describe. I begin to make this argument by way of a close rereading of moments in Writing Culture. I then turn to David Hume's writings on empiricism, which, I suggest, offer the ingredients for an empiricism that is both skeptical and ethical because it includes among its objects of inquiry the apparatuses through which reality is known. I end by exploring dangers and possibilities associated with kinky empiricism by juxtaposing a moment from my research on state building in Dutch New Guinea with the approach taken in Philippe Bourgois and Jeffrey Schonberg's groundbreaking study, Righteous Dopefiend.

20232,FN-260675-18,"This study has two aims. First, it lays out the synchronic patterning of four constructions that express static location in Secoya (Tukanoan). Each construction licenses different semantic verb types: topological verbs, postural verbs, an existential verb, and a copula. Second, this study explores the different construals encoded by these constructions and highlights the ways speakers use them creatively to elaborate on stage-level properties adjacent to location in locative utterances. Data collected from six speakers using visual stimuli reveal that each of the constructions elaborates on specific aspects of locative scenes. Responses for typical/atypical scenes, negative polarity statements, and frequency patterns show that speakers can choose conceptualizations that favor Ground geometry, Figure posture, more complex Figure dispositions, or marked perspectivizations. Similar phenomena are observed in other Amazonian languages. These results raise difficulties in identifying a basic locative construction, suggesting that Secoya may not fit squarely into any type in existing typologies of spatial expression (e.g., Ameka and Levinson 2007). Additionally, the Secoya system raises questions about the relationship between conceptual alternativity and the notion of ""basicness"" with respect to construal types.",Open access,"Hunter Brown, Rosa Vallejos",Journal,Cognitive Linguistics,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cog-2020-0099/html,Cognitive Linguistics Volume 32 Issue 2,De Gruyter Mouton,,,"Locative construals: topology, posture, disposition, and perspective in Secoya and beyond",2021

Gender markers and shape classifiers are used in antecedent-anaphor relations. They appear in pronominal forms, demonstratives, and numerals to differentiate referents, playing a role in the way discourse is constructed and maintained. Second, a corpus study reveals that some traces of agreement might be emerging; however, it is currently restricted to one specific context, and there is significant speaker variation.

Contrary to practices in many liberal democracies, where individuals could choose to participate in a religious legal system but have the alternative of a civil legal system, Muslims had no choice in the matter. Even more surprising, the government expected non-Muslims to abide by the state's Sharia legislative protocols in some circumstances, such as divorces in which one party was Muslim, or in property disputes involving Islamic charitable endowments (waqf). Through this peculiar legal arrangement, an assemblage of imperial remnants that had been shaped by differentiated rights, religious protections, and legal pluralism was thrust into the constitutional and legal framework of a European nationstate.

He began to claim, for instance, that the libretto was based on a crime of passion he had witnessed in Montalto and invented a version of that crime that matched the libretto. Furthermore, in preparation of the first performance in Paris, he actively contributed to a staging faithfully depicting Montalto in an attempt to highlight the originality of the story.

""Depend upon it that rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully,"" he wrote to his friend Harrison Blake in 1849: ""To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogin."" But what did he mean in saying so? Thoreau's understanding of the term yoga derived entirely from ancient Indian texts. In the 1840s, he read avidly and empathetically in key Indic works such as the Laws of Manu and the Bhagavad Gita. Drawing on Ralph Waldo Emerson's notion of ""one mind"" as a hermeneutical principle, Thoreau sought to overcome temporal and spatial distance in his reading and to integrate ideas and practices of these Hindu texts from ancient India selectively within his own life. Listening to the voices of Indic sages reinforced Thoreau's own inclinations toward austerity and equanimity. They gave him a foundation for his life experiments in voluntary simplification and yogic contemplation at Walden Pond. This essay, which is a contribution to the Common Knowledge symposium on xenophilia, traces Thoreau's engagement with ancient Indian works during the 1840s and contrasts his way of reading with those of other scholars during the period.

20326,FA-232540-16,"Two thirteenth-century vernacular motets copied side by side in the Montpellier Codex tell a story of sin and repentance. In one a shepherd rapes a maiden, while in the other a penitent begs the Virgin Mary to forgive a great sin. The music of these two motets is nearly identical: one is a contrafactum of the other, and represents a conscious narrative continuation of the first. This article offers a close reading of this unusual pair of motets, interpreting their texts and polyphonic musical settings in the context of other motets, the pastourelle song genre, their liturgical tenor, the technique of contrafacture, the chanson pieuse, and the intertextual refrain repertory. The two motets constitute a medieval exploration of the boundary between seduction and rape, and the spiritual consequences of its transgression. Having placed the story told by the motets in the context of medieval attitudes toward rape in both legal and pedagogical spheres, I close by reflecting on the ethics of listening to artistic representations of violence for both medieval and modern audiences.",,Jennifer Saltzstein,Journal,Journal of the American Musicological Society,,,University of California Press,https://online.ucpress.edu/jams/article-abstract/70/3/583/92350/Rape-and-Repentance-in-Two-Medieval-Motets?redirectedFrom=fulltext,,Rape and Repentance in Two Medieval Motets,2017
20327,FA-232540-16,"Thirteenth-century trouvère songs and motets often begin with a conventionalized introduction in which the sensory experience of a springtime landscape inspires the composer to think of his beloved and to sing. Long derided as insincere by critics or simply ignored, the ""springtime opening"" of the trouvères represents one of the largest bodies of nature imagery in medieval vernacular song. Drawing on a corpus of over one hundred songs and motets, this article offers an ecomusicological reconsideration of the springtime opening, revealing that the way individual medieval composers invoked nature imagery was often correlated with their status and geography. Aristocratic trouvères, who had ready access to open expanses of land on their estates, used the opening often and earnestly. An emerging group of urban trouvères, many of whom were educated clerics, rarely invoked the springtime opening, and when they did, they distanced themselves from it through clever inversions and parody. I argue that these divergent reactions to nature imagery likely reflected lived experiences in the environment, and further, that the songs bear witness to major changes in land management in urban and rural northern France. These songs and motets prompt observations about the relationships between nature, culture, and crisis in medieval and modern society.",,Jennifer Saltzstein,,Journal of the  American Musicological Society,https://online.ucpress.edu/jams/article-abstract/72/1/115/109686/Songs-of-Nature-in-Medieval-Northern-France,,University of California Press,,,"Songs of Nature in Medieval Northern France: Landscape, Identity, and Environment",2019
20332,FT-269846-20,"Congress played almost no role in regulating the entry of immigrants before the Civil War. The states passed their own laws controlling the admission, exclusion, and expulsion of foreigners, as well as the movement of free and enslaved African Americans. When a national immigration policy began to emerge for the first time during the Civil War, it was shaped by the dominant ideology of antislavery. In 1862 Congress passed legislation prohibiting American involvement in the so-called coolie trade, equating the transportation of unfree Chinese laborers with slavery. Legislation passed in 1864, by contrast, gave federal recognition to the recruit- ment of European workers on short-term contracts. The 1862 law led indirectly to the exclusion of Chinese laborers in 1882, which was justified as an antislavery measure. The 1864 law, meanwhile, generated opposition to immigrant contract labor, also on antislavery grounds, culminating in the prohibition of immigrant contracts under the Foran Act of 1885. In this way, Chinese migration was coded as inherently unfree, and European workers, liberated from the shackles of contract, emerged as America's archetypal immigrants. Together, these two developments during the Civil War laid the groundwork for the federal immigration system of the postbellum era.",Subscription only,Kevin Kenny,Journal,Journal of the Civil War Era,https://www.journalofthecivilwarera.org/,Journal website,University of North Carolina Press,,,The Antislavery Origins of US Immigration Policy,2021

They contributed to finding his mode of travelling, and framed Humboldt's understanding of politics in the revolutionary epoch between 1789 and 1848. With the exception of the Orinoco in South America, Humboldt studied no other river landscape as intensely as that of the Rhine.  This interest allowed him to refine his geological interests, produce his first book, and reference the Rhine region as a point of comparison in his research and published work, from his American journey to the magnum opus Kosmos. Humboldt's cultural and political experiences at the Rhine illustrate, too, the epoch's tensions between a conservative, anti-revolutionary attitude and the growing dynamics of the liberal-minded, civic society. The latter began to embrace Prussia's efforts to forge a new German patriotism in the 1840s, as evident in the celebrations devoted to the completion of the Cologne Cathedral in 1842 and 1848, which Humboldt observed first-hand.",open access after some years,Andreas W.

Using intentionally wetted paper, the rate of mass loss of a wet, encapsulated paper was measured and found to be 1000 times slower than the rate of mass loss from wetted unencapsulated paper. The results show that water vapor can permeate through the PET film and the measured rate of vapor flux increases with decreasing PET thickness. The measured mass loss from the encapsulate was used to calculate the relative humidity (RH) inside the encapsulate and the moisture content of the encapsulated paper. The moisture content of encapsulated paper was calculated to be slighter higher than the moisture content of unencapsulated paper, which might be due to a modified cellulose network structure caused by the slower mass loss or variability in the paper, or due to condensation of water vapor on the PET within the encapsulate. The results of this paper quantify the movement of water vapor through PET film and provide conservators insight on the microenvironment in their PET enclosures.",Subscription,"Andrea K.I.

Interpreted here are his statements that: 1) the paradoxes show that his contemporaries did not yet have the real and genuine concept of set needed; 2) that if one is clear and distinct with respect to meaning, one readily sees the contradiction involved in the set-theoretical paradoxes; 3) that the solution to them would lie in demonstrating the shift in meaning that makes it that one is not immediately aware of the contradiction and once it is perceived it one cannot indicate wherein it lies.

20362,FZ-231436-15,"When the Cincinnati school board voted to end Bible reading in the schools in 1869, the national dispute and lawsuit that followed came to be called the Bible War, yet the opening salvos of the war began in the 1830s. The Western Literary Institute and College of Professional Teachers championed the public-school movement in the West in Cincinnati from 1831 to 1840. Catholic Bishop John Baptist Purcell disrupted its Protestant hegemony. While struggles in New York City and Philadelphia in the 1840s overshadow Cincinnati historiographically, College meetings set the pattern for later sectarian disputes over education in the Old Northwest. Protestant belief in the priestly monopoly over the Bible and in Catholicism as a threat to civil and religious liberty and education undermined the legitimacy of Catholic challenges to Protestant Bibles in the schools. These sectarian beliefs drew on, and became part of, a mythic history already existent and still on display during the Bible War when Rev. Benjamin P. Aydelott recounted his College meeting dispute with Purcell as dramatic struggle over the fate of the nation.

20363,FZ-231436-15,"In 1869, the Cincinnati school board ended a forty-year tradition of Bible reading in the schools in an attempt to encourage Catholics to use them, thus provoking national controversy and a lawsuit brought by pro-Bible advocates. Scholars regularly cite the Ohio Supreme Court decision in favor of the school board as a landmark in the legal separation of church and state. This article interrogates the meaning of the secularization of law by examining expressions of juristic, pedagogic, and popular consciousness in the multiple levels and spaces where individuals raised and resolved constitutional questions on education. Dissenting Christian tradition shaped the legal brief of Stanley Matthews, the school board's lead attorney. Matthews' sacralized the religious liberty guarantee found in the Ohio Constitution within a post-millennialist framework. Ohio Chief Justice John Welch hybridized Christian dissenting tradition with deistic rationalism in Board of Education v. Minor, et al, thus appealing to as broad a constituency as had the right to elect justices to the Ohio Supreme Court. The limited, technical ruling allowed for a metropole/periphery divide in educational practice, so that Bible reading and prayer in Ohio public schools continued well into the 20th century. Far from a landmark in secularization of the law, the Bible War case demonstrates the persistent power of religion to frame law, including the law of religious liberty.",subscription,Linda Przybyszewski,Journal,Law and History Review,,,Law and History Review,,,Religious Liberty Sacralized: The Persistence of Christian Dissenting Tradition and the Cincinnati Bible War,2021
20364,FZ-231436-15,"In November of 1869, two teams of lawyers squared off to argue whether or not the Cincinnati school board had the power to end a forty-year-old practice: starting the school day with a reading from the Bible and the singing of hymns.  When the board voted to end the practice despite the protests, a lawsuit was quickly filed.  During the oral arguments Stanley Matthews made a point of putting on display both his faith in God and his belief in the Bible as God's revealed Word in order to arguing that Bible reading must stop because only a mortal who accepted Jesus Christ freely could be saved. Matthews himself had experienced a dramatic religious conversion after the tragic deaths of four of his children in 1859 drove him to the brink of insanity. Instead, he embraced conservative Presbyterianism and the duty to evangelize as he did from the courtroom floor. His argument played a crucial role in winning the case when it was appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, and probably explains why he remained a respectable enough man from the religious point of view to make his way to the Senate and the Supreme Court.",,Linda Przybyszewski,Journal,Journal of Supreme Court History,,,Journal of Supreme Court History,,,"Scarlet Fever, Stanley Matthews, and the Cincinnati Bible War",2017
20366,FT-254241-17,"During the late twentieth century, drawing on C. P. Snow's well-known concept of a ""two cultures"" divide between scientists and humanists, many psychologists identified polarizing divergences in their discipline. This essay traces how purported professional divides affected the understanding and management of mental retardation in clinical psychology. Previous work in the history of science has compared the differing cultures of disciplines, demonstrating that there is no one, unified science. Through an examination of multiple ""two cultures"" divides within the discipline of psychology, the essay demonstrates that perceived divergences in the field were animated by considerations of professional identity, ambitions, and goals. It argues that differing views among clinical psychologists about mental retardation, and crucially the localization of its causes—in individual bodies, minds, and genomes or within social institutions—reflected their position among the multiple ""cultures"" of psychology. References to Snow's two cultures spanned the late twentieth-century scientific and clinical literature and were often used to encourage a conversation about the nature and goals of research in a field. In considering these purported ""two cultures"" divides, the essay proposes that historians of science must take care to look beyond constructed polarities, to instead analyze the resulting discussions about professional training and purpose.",,Andrew J.

In this article, I suggest that critiques of the so-called medical model have been an important vehicle by which alternative narratives of disability entered the clinical arena. Historians of medicine have rarely engaged with the medical model beyond descriptive accounts of it. I argue that to more adequately address disability perspectives, historians of medicine must better historicize the medical model concept and critique, which has been drawn upon by physicians, activists, and others to advance particular perspectives on disability. My present contribution describes two distinct formulations of critique that originated in differing interest groups and characterized the medical model alternatively as insufficient and oppressive.

20368,FT-254241-17,"Over the last 6 decades, many published commentaries, from both within and outside the medical community, have criticized medicine's characterization and management of mental illness and disability. These critiques have often referenced the ""medical model,"" a term that has multiple meanings but has almost always been used pejoratively. Prominent critics have included disability scholars and self-advocates, who attacked the so-called ""medical model"" and espoused an alternative ""social model,"" which characterizes disability as the product of an unaccommodating and oppressive society, rather than an individual and medical problem.  The terms ""social model"" and ""medical model"" have frequently been used to highlight opposing views of disability, but there has been little historical examination of their origins and evolving meanings. 1 As a result, clinicians have had limited access to information about what these concepts mean to patients, making it difficult to respond adequately to the concerns they raise. For physicians, fully embracing social-model views would require political engagement and a greater focus on societal, rather than individual, problems. Even if most physicians do not adopt these roles, increased awareness of disability perspectives and familiarity with critiques of the medical model may help them to identify new ways of improving care for their patients, while also enhancing opportunities and support for clinical trainees and colleagues with disabilities.",,Andrew J.

These kin and enslaved persons of the chiefly house were struggling over whether a slave baby should become the chieftain of this sprawling realm. The documents were preserved in the hereditary house of the native chieftain along with some 500 manuscripts in an indigenous script now called Nasu, which carried its own assumptions about what writing was and what it could do. I read the Chinese-language legal documents with an eye to the tradition of Nasu ritual writing. I argue that a group of bondsmen accused of rebelling against the chiefly household were actually seeking to preserve it by extending the ritualized tasks of writing ancestry and descent into the realm of Qing legal practice. This allows me to extend the first of two methodological suggestions: that the kinship of bondage and the bondage of kinship are best seen as participating reciprocally in a single field of relations. I then follow a group of domestic slaves as they travel to the administrative city and search for a litigation master to write up their own legal plaint. With this exercise, I propose a second methodological argument: that reading and writing are complex human skills, often partly available even to those who cannot use pen and paper, and involving the coordination of forms of textuality across different planes of inscription.",Open access,Erik Mueggler,Journal,Comparative Studies in Society and History,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/rewriting-bondage-literacy-and-slavery-in-a-qing-native-domain/5C43878837DCA48FFF50B6C58175C152,"Link to article in Comparative Studies in Society and History, published by Cambridge University Press.",Cambridge University Press,https://www.academia.edu/45118979/Rewriting Bondage Literacy and Slavery in a Qing Native Domain,Link to Academia.edu account,Rewriting Bondage: Literacy and Slavery in a Qing Native Domain,2021

The analysis focuses on three individuals who represent distinct approaches to negotiating the relationship of religion and nation.

The second approach entails a transition from secular-nationalism to a type of Islamic nationalism or even Islamic secularism. The third approach resists both forms of nationalism, seeking a transcendent Islam in which ethnicity and nation recede within a new religious humanism. The core argument throughout is that processes of religious return, often analyzed in relation to transnational trends, take diverse and indeterminate forms.

In the short term, the Nineteenth Amendment made the work of white supremacy much more difficult, triggering a new round of Klan violence in the style of the old and stimulating efforts to retool the techniques of disfranchisement. Over the next half century, the racial dynamics forged in the aftermath of ratification resonated as the Republican Party reconstituted its white base in the South and as women's rights activists, Black and white, struggled to make common cause in the feminist upsurge of the 1960s and 1970s.  Before the end of the century, a women's voting bloc did indeed emerge, one with high voter turnout, a sharp preference for one party, and consistent performance across election cycles. That voting bloc emerged not among white women but among African American women. After many African Americans moved north and west in the Great Migration; after most Black voters moved into the Democratic column; and after the Voting Rights Act became law, African American women registered and voted, en masse, sometimes despite ongoing resistance.  Their votes have made a difference. Sometimes their votes have made the difference.

It combined an ambitious historical reconstruction of daily life in the year 1900 in a mid-size city in the Habsburg-ruled part of Ukraine and an engaging plot skilfully employing multiple devices associated with the Gothic tradition, especially in its latter-day and postmodernist reinterpretations. The novel's success is especially telling in the context of the rising interest in the Gothic in Ukrainian culture. Told by an unreliable narrator, the novel prompts readers to interrogate their assumptions. In the context of Ukraine, it is particularly subversive in its engagement with the nostalgic myth of the Habsburg Empire as a multi-ethnic utopia of tolerance, and by implication it challenges all imperial myths. The novel's emphasis on the quest for (self-)discovery strongly resonated with readers in the context of a socio-political crisis, which highlighted the relevance of the distinct postcolonial overtones in its message.",Subscription only,Vitaly Chernetsky,Journal,Canadian Slavonic Papers,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00085006.2019.1668337,Link to the article on the journal website,Canadian Slavonic Papers,,,Sofiia Andrukhovych’s Felix Austria: The Postcolonial Neo-Gothic and Ukraine’s Search for Itself,2019

In this essay, inspired by the empiricist philosopher David Hume and the anthropologist Nancy Munn, I develop a materialist concept of sympathy in an effort to cast new light on the expansion of colonial rule. I deploy this concept in an analysis of reports written just before WWII by officials charged with extending the Netherlands Indies government's reach within western New Guinea. Along with gifts and outright acts of coercion, these officials made sympathy into a central component of their practices. Instead of avoiding the natives' gaze, they sought out more or less intimate moments of identification with their subjects; they tried to adopt the Papuans' perspective to reform Papuan ways. In teasing out the causal force of sympathy, as these officials viewed it, I make causal claims of my own about the impact of this experience of empire on the Netherlands' subsequent policy in New Guinea. In doing so, I advocate an approach to anthropological analysis that is empirical, if not empiricist, one that insists on the power of circumstances to shape the imagination, and the power of the imagination to shape the world.",Open Access,Danilyn Rutherford,Journal,Cultural Anthropology 24 (1),https://culanth.org/articles/100-sympathy-state-building-and-the-experience-of,Cultural Anthropology Website,Duke University Press,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1360.2009.00025.x/full,Wiley Blackwell,"Sympathy, State-Building, and the Experience of Empire",2009

An analysis of the regional distribution of the Duck Dance song and a comparison of how the song has been adapted to specific local and translocal spaces suggests that for Woodlands peoples, living within one's community of origin does not imply isolation from global culture, nor does participation in global culture imply a loss of either local or regional identity.

Like other First Peoples the world over, Native Americans have endured acute pressure to relinquish their cultural identities, which are often expressed most tangibly through performance. Following a summary of social and political forces in the 1960s that stimulated Native American music revivals, I summarize the history of a Choctaw music revival begun in the 1970s and compare it to the Chickasaw music revival begun in 1992. I conclude that the Choctaw and Chickasaw have long confronted social, cultural, and economic change through conscious and creative transformations.

Many of these songs incorporate what we call asymmetrical repetition, that is, the alteration of a musical phrase upon repeat. The alterations introduce nuance into a musical form that otherwise would be highly redundant. Asymmetrical repetition thus energizes songs meant to be performed communally in social or ceremonial contexts. We present close analyses of four Native American songs from different tribes and regions to illustrate asymmetrical repetition, and suggest that similarities reveal systematic aspects of form related to larger cultural and social systems. Specifically, it seems possible to connect the similarities to underlying concepts of time and place, to widespread intertribal musical performance, and to deep historical connections among geographically distant communities.

In reviewing the cross-examination of experts, it becomes clear that the defense sought to accentuate the ethnic dimensions of the conflict in order to mount a necessity defense.

The distance enables them to resist daily demands on their income and makes it possible for them to save and to invest in long term projects such as home building, their children's education, and family and religious celebrations. Yet, social criticism often blames women for the problems of marriage: such as the high divorce rate, infidelity, and financial squabbling between spouses. In this paper, I focus on the religious aspects of women's migration; I argue that Murid women deflect criticism of their wealth earned abroad by investing in the signs and symbols of a Muslim Sufi congregation. By visiting (ziyara), dressing up (sañse), and donating generously to shaykhs (addiya), Murid women display their wealth, convey the strength of their social networks, and construct themselves as candidates for salvation. Murid women engage in the global economy and preserve their distinctively Murid vision of the world and their place in it. Is it possible to understand their global engagement as a form of cosmopolitanism, as a practice and a form of consciousness, which is rooted in history and which is universal?

Another, the applicative construction, also functions as a morphological causative in the context of a subset of stative intransitive verbs.

10320,FN-50084-11,"Northern Paiute (Western Numic; Uto-Aztecan) forms relative, or attributive, clauses through&#x0D; nominalization. Givón (1990) describes nominalization as one of seven strategies, found crosslinguistically, employed by languages in the formation of relative clauses. One theoretical question is whether to consider nominalization as a strategy per se available to languages in the formation of relative clauses or, rather, to treat nominalization and relative clause formation as part of the same complex functional and grammatical domain. The latter approach has been proposed, for example, for some Tibeto-Burman languages (Noonan 1997, DeLancey 1986) as well as some Turkic languages (Greg S. Anderson, in personal communication). Relative clauses formed via nominalization can be viewed as morphosyntactically complex noun phrases, just as simple nominalizations are morphologically complex nouns. Their role in narrowing (in the case of headless relative clauses, establishing) reference, or in characterizing nominal attributes, typically through a genitive (possessive) relationship, can then be better articulated.

This paper examines the way in which specific relations of power and identity were constructed through Inca management of water. To this end, I offer a comparative analysis of water-related features from different sectors of the Empire, representing different moments in its historical development. The intent is to further our understanding of how the manipulation of water figured in the imperializing process and how its use and meaning may have evolved over time. The architectural evidence from the sites included in the study suggests that conspicuous exercise of control over the movement and flow of water may have been more critical to the establishment of Inca hegemony than to its subsequent maintenance.",sub,"Bray, Tamara",Journal,Latin American Antiquity,http://saa.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/saa/laa/2013/00000024/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=1ur73v2e2sjlu.alexandra,,Latin American Antiquity,,,"Water, Ritual and Power in the Inca Empire",2013

This study lays the foundation for exploring these issues through the lens of ceramic production and exchange. Utilized in both mundane and elite tasks, and capable of signaling function, status, and ethnicity, ceramics are invaluable for tracking the movement of people and goods, and for exploring the kinds and scale of interactions among them. Key questions motivating this study include: were ceramics moving among communities in the pre-imperial period, and if so, over what distances? What types of vessels were involved, and what social contexts and activities (tribute, communal feasting, gift exchange) account for their movement?

10421,FA-57352-13,"In Schroeder [2015], I defended the view that knowledge can be successfully analyzed as belief for reasons that are both subjectively and objectively sufficient.  Since this is Kant's characterization of knowledge in the first Critique, let us call this the Kantian Account.   My aim in that paper was to argue that the Kantian Account provides a simple and attractive way of making good on the idea that knowledge involves a kind of match between subjective and objective factors – the right sort of match to explain why knowledge is prime, why it has a distinctive kind of explanatory power, along the lines defended by Williamson [2000], and why it exhibits the phenomenon that I call defeater pairing, on which, very roughly, objective conditions that defeat knowledge come paired with subjective counterparts.   The Kantian Account, I argued, provides a way of making sense of these things without getting into either of the two major sources of trouble that have traditionally plagued similarly motivated analyses of knowledge: the conditional fallacy and the defeater dialectic.   &#x0D; Daniel Whiting [2015] argues, in this journal, that I have overstated my case.  More specifically, he argues that the Kantian Account founders on one of the most classic cases in the Gettierological literature, fake barns.   In this paper I'll rehearse the problem of fake barns as faced by the Kantian Account.  We'll see that this problem requires a certain view about the nature of basic perceptual reasons.  Hence, I'll argue that by adopting an alternative account of basic perceptual reasons, the Kantian Account can evade Whiting's objection, and I'll argue that this alternative account is independently better motivated.  The moral will be that though Whiting is right to press his objection to the treatment of fake barns in my earlier paper, the Kantian Account itself can escape unscathed.",Open access,Mark Schroeder,Journal,Logos and Episteme,http://logos-and-episteme.acadiasi.ro/in-defense-of-the-kantian-account-of-knowledge-reply-to-whiting-pages-371-382/,Journal webpage.,Logos and Episteme,http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55505fc8e4b032b4451e4a90/t/55ca368ee4b080aed53c4a57/1439315598977/Schroeder Reply to-Whiting.pdf,Pre-publication draft on author's homepage.,In Defense of the Kantian Account of Knowledge: Reply to Whiting,2015

The only problem with this view, Pritchard notes, is that it ""occupies a region of logical space in epistemology that many hold is simply unavailable"".   According to Pritchard's diagnosis, there are three chief prima facie problems for his brand of epistemological disjunctivism that have seemed to make it unavailable, and his defense is constituted by replies to these three problems, in addition to an elaboration of its virtues.

But pirates also illustrate an underappreciated process in the development of modern states and empires: the struggle between state and non-state actors to establish a monopoly of violence on the high seas. This essay traces this contest over violence in three stages: (1) the challenge posed by English pirates to Europe's dominant imperial power, Spain, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; (2) the threat made by these same pirates to the emerging British Empire in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; and (3) the successful efforts of the British state to exert control over the Atlantic through state-sponsored forms of piracy, privateers and press gangs, in the eighteenth century.

Von Uslar stepped into a vacuum created by German ethnocentrism and its dismissive colonial gaze.

The well-known mutual toleration, even syncretism, among Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and the popular religion – referred to by Voltaire – is only one side of Ming religious life.  During the high Ming, in particular, zealous Confucian officials launched attacks on temples of the other religions, dubbing them ""improper shrines.""  The images of some of these men were placed into shrines to receive offerings while they were alive.  Such premortem shrines have been seen as primarily political, but in this case, they honored men who had angered the people of the jurisdiction, and in a sense replaced deities important to the community.  Viewing premortem shrines in the light of religious competition suggests that the shrines may have captured a kind of violent spiritual power not normally associated with Confucian officials.",,Sarah Schneewind,Journal,The Sixteenth Century Journal,,,,,,The Lady Vanishes: Religious Conflict and Premortem Enshrinement in Sixteenth-Century China,2021

That scholarly work suggests that Tang and Song premortem shrines when political were basically elite institutions; and that when common people were involved their motivations were religious rather than political. In Ming times, by contrast, premortem shrines were normatively established by commoners and constituted a venue for popular political participation, while the steles commemorating the shrines explicitly argued that non-elite people had the right to political speech.

20599,HD-51705-13,"The abolitionist movement of the nineteenth­ century United States remains among the most significant social and political movements in US history. Abolitionist newspapers played a crucial role in spreading information and shaping public opinion around a range of issues relating to the abolition of slavery. These newspapers also serve as a primary source of information about the movement for scholars today, resulting in powerful new accounts of the movement and its leaders. This paper supplements recent qualitative work on the role of women in abolition's vanguard, as well as the role of the Black press, with a quantitative text modeling approach. Using diachronic word embeddings, we identify which newspapers tended to lead lexical semantic innovations — the introduction of new usages of specific words —and which newspapers tended to follow. We then aggregate the evidence across hundreds of changes into a weighted network with the newspapers as nodes; directed edge weights represent the frequency with which each newspaper led the other in the adoption of a lexical semantic change. Analysis of this network reveals pathways of lexical semantic influence, distinguishing leaders from followers, as well as others who stood apart from the semantic changes that swept through this period. More specifically, we find that two newspapers edited by women—The Provincial Freeman and The Lily —led a large number of semantic changes in our corpus, lending additional credence to the argument that a multiracial coalition of women led the abolitionist movement in terms of both thought and action. It also contributes additional complexity to the scholarship that has sought to tease apart the relation of the abolitionist movement to the women's suffrage movement, and the vexed racial politics that characterized their relation.",OA,"Sandeep Soni, Lauren Klein, Jacob Eisenstein",Journal,Journal of Cultural Analytics,https://culturalanalytics.org/article/18841-abolitionist-networks-modeling-language-change-in-nineteenth-century-activist-newspapers,,n/a,,,“Abolitionist Networks: Modeling Language Change in 19th-Century Activist Newspapers.”,2021

A crucial step in working with such collections is to separate the main text of a work from the surrounding paratext, the content of which may distort word counts, location references, sentiment scores, and other important outputs. Simple heuristic methods have been devised, but are not accurate for some texts and some methodological needs. This study describes a method for paratext detection based on smoothed unsupervised clustering. We show that this method is more accurate than simple heuristics, especially for non-fiction works, and edited works with larger amounts of paratext.

20639,FT-254546-17,"This essay explores how some Americans came to view the Federal Council of Churches (FCC) and, more broadly, ecumenical mainline Protestantism as a threat to the national security interests of the United States. By focusing on the efforts of various elements in the federal bureaucracy—including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chemical Warfare Service, and Military Intelligence—and the work of average Americans to investigate the FCC, the essay examines how techniques of surveillance and information management helped shape the way Americans came to understand religion in the twentieth century. The essay develops three interconnected themes: first, the rise of America's national security surveillance establishment in the United States after World War I; second, the development of new methods of information management and visualization in corporate and state bureaucracies; and, third, the rise of voluntary, private surveillance in the wake of World War I. Through these three themes, the essay highlights how a network of federal bureaucrats, business leaders, and average citizens used graphs, indexes, and files to interpret mainline, ecumenical Christianity as a threat to domestic security in the United States. Ultimately, the project suggests that scholarly efforts to assess fissures in U.S. Protestantism have focused too much on controversies over belief and theology—especially those related to evolutionary theory, eschatology, and scriptural inerrancy—and paid far too little attention to the emerging bureaucratic systems of state and corporate surveillance that helped to document, visualize, and disseminate these accusations in the first place.",,Michael J.

20645,MD-268969-20,"Colleges and universities across the United States are recognizing the public memory function of their campus spaces and facing difficult decisions about how to represent the ugly sides of their histories within their landscapes of remembrance. Official administrative responses to demands for greater inclusiveness are often slow and conservative in nature. Using our own institution and our work with local Indigenous community members as a case study, we argue that students and faculty can employ community-engaged, public-facing, digital composing projects to effectively challenge entrenched institutional interests that may elide or even misrepresent difficult histories in public memory works. Such projects are a nimble and accessible means of creating counter-narratives to intervene in public memory discourses. Additionally, by engaging in public discourses, such work helps promote meaningful student rhetorical learning in courses across disciplines.",Open access,"Amy J. Lueck, Lee Panich, Matt V.

20650,HAA-256146-17,"In Part 1, we contend that design is fundamental to feminist digital humanities. ""Design"" refers to structures and to the process of inventing them; it also encompasses matters of style and aesthetics. If modernist studies is to thrive in a digital age, we must attend to questions of style and UX (user experience) design. To give design its due is a feminist act. It involves considering the audience's needs and interests, recognizing them as partners in the scholarly endeavor, and embracing style and aesthetics as crucial to the work of digital humanities. Feminist design also entails rethinking the processes of generating and disseminating knowledge and reinventing our scholarly methods in order to break down hierarchies, encourage open exchanges of expertise, and reflect the diversity of human creative production.  In Part II, we discuss Mina Loy: Navigating the Avant-Garde, an experiment in modernist digital humanities that aims to move questions of design from the periphery to the center of scholarly attention (http://mina-loy.com/). Loy serves not only as a representative of women in the avant-garde, but also as a model for what digital humanists can be, if, like Loy, we dare to design radically new forms and processes.","Open access for limited time, then subscription only","Suzanne W.

The event stemmed from a new Ottoman court ceremonial, and its sundry activities, including gift exchanges, mock battles, processions, skills demonstrations, and feasts, were spread over a twenty-day period. These activities enabled individuals and groups within the Ottoman political-military elite, and within the city of Constantinople, to perform their identities and assert their place in the Ottoman social order. The ceremony allows us to discuss the origins and contents of Ottoman ceremonial culture, which borrowed themes and motifs from the Byzantines, the Venetians, and the myriad Turko-Muslim polities with whom the Ottomans maintained intense diplomatic and cultural relations. Next, it highlights the elevation of male circumcision, a fundamental ritual in all Islamic societies, to the status of a major dynastic event that addressed the entire Ottoman polity as well as its competitors in East and West. Finally, it shows how, in early modern societies, public ceremonies served as instruments of governance by creating highly visible, memorable, and relatively participatory events, and by constituting new spaces for political and cultural interactions.",,Kaya Sahin,Journal,American Historical Review,https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/123.2.463,,Oxford University Press,,,Staging an Empire: An Ottoman Circumcision Ceremony as Cultural Performance,2018
