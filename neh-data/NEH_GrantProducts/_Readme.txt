Data for each type of product is contained in an XML file suitably named. 

There is also a CSV file with the same data, named to match the XML file.

Each XML file refers to a corresponding schema (NEH_Books.xml refers to NEH_Books.xsd, etc.).

For details about the data elements in each XML file, refer to NEH_GrantProductsDictionary.pdf included in this .zip archive. The data elements in the CSV files match the schema outlined in the products dictionary.

The datasets included in this .zip archive are updated every two months, and the latest version will be available at the following location:

NOTE: The NEH began collecting data about grant products in 2014, and so most of the information included in these datasets pertains to recent products. Older data about books published with the help of NEH grants was imported from a log maintained by the NEH Office of Planning and Budget, but in all other cases the data comes from the grantees themselves.
