		<Abstract>The City of Petersburg chancery records scanning project officially began on Friday June 3! The first 50 boxes of case-files were loaded for transfer to LVA's digital vendor (Backstage Library Works) in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Imaging of these fragile court papers will begin next week and resulting images will be posted to the Chancery Records Index (CRI) after ensuring they meet strict preservation and quality control standards. The records date from 1787 to 1912 and consist of 150 cubic feet, including bills of complaint, affidavits, wills, business records, correspondence, and photographs.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The history of Native Americans symbolizes the long path of American history – and in the 20th century the nation and the race continued to intersect through world wars, cold wars and cultural wars. Paul C. Rosier traces the way American Indians defined their cultural and spiritual values in the context of U.S. engagements at home and overseas. In his book, "Serving Their Country: American Indian Politics and Patriotism in the Twentieth Century," recently released by Harvard University Press, Rosier shows how Native Americans' struggles for rights and justice are – like the efforts of African Americans – an integral part of the development of American society. Rosier is an associate professor of history at Villanova University.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Wat passe?". What has happened to Italian language and identity in the European scenario of Diego Marani's fiction? "Aqui in Venezia sumus, keine Paris!"… Really? An Italian newspaper columnist, novelist and translator for the Council of the European Union, Diego Marani invented an artificial language called Europanto in which he has been writing articles and short stories since 1996. More than a mock international language with a provocative aim, Europanto offers the model for a non-hierarchical European subjectivity that erodes national linguistic barriers and also the all-encompassing power of English as Europe's alleged lingua franca.&amp;#x0D; "Eh? Wat signifique?" "No! No esse so facile!"&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>In previous posts, I've shown how WordSeer can be used to explore small, well-defined questions: what word did Shakespeare use for ‘beautiful'? Is the occurrence of the word ‘love' the same in the comedies and tragedies? This post is different. WordSeer has now developed enough to support a simple, but complete, exploratory analysis.  The question we'll think about is this:  "How does the portrayal of men and women in Shakespeare's plays change under different circumstances?"  As one answer, we'll see how WordSeer suggests that when love is a major plot point, the language referring to women changes to become more physical, and the language referring to men becomes more sentimental.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When scholars try to make sense out of large collections of text, they frequently do two things: compare, and collect. They collect samples of "interesting" things, and compare them with each other along various relevant dimensions.  In this post, I demonstrate the collection and comparison features of WordSeer by using it to compare the usage of the word "love" in Shakespeares comedies and tragedies. You can watch the screencast, or simply read on. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>A common problem in search and exploration interfaces is the vocabulary problem. This refers to the great variety of words with which different people can use to describe the same concept. For people exploring a text collection, this makes search difficult. There are only a limited number different queries they can think of to describe that concept, but they may be missing many other instances that use different words. This is an important issue for humanities scholars. Often, the very first step of a literature analysis is to comb through text, trying to find  thought-provoking examples to study later.  In this post, I give an example of how our project WordSeer, a text analysis environment for humanities scholars, can be used to overcome this problem. In this example, I'll using an instance of WordSeer running on the complete works of Shakespeare from the Internet Shakespeare Editions. It's live, so you can follow along with this example on the web at wordseer.berkeley.edu/shakespeare.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Stowe missed the deadline for the installment of Uncle Tom's Cabin that was to appear on December 18, 1851. The reason for the missed deadline is unknown.Stowe had failed to meet her deadline twice before; the missed deadline for the December 18 issue was her last such inadvertency. But perhaps missing the deadline for this particular installment was a tactical decision on Stowe's part, designed for a particular effect upon her readers. Analysis of the episodes that were published immediately before and after the number of the Era that appeared without an installment of the tale suggests that Stowe purposely missed her deadline in order to intensify the effect of the Christmas installment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One challenge in modeling buildings and spaces now lost to us is interpreting the evidence that survives. One image that we thought gave us a different view of Paul's Cross turns out to be based on the Gipkin painting and looks different because the engraver reversed the Gipkin image in the process of making this image.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In creating a model for the Paul's Cross preaching station, we have had to decide where the preacher stood to deliver his sermon -- underneath the roof of the preaching station or in a pulpit that placed him out from under the roof. We have reviewed contemporary images of preaching stations as well as surviving examples of such structures and decided he was probably in a small pulpit.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Virtual Paul's Cross Project is made possible because St. Paul's Cathedral was the subject of an extensive body of visual documentation. For St. Paul's, the most important are the engravings of Wenseslas Hollar, done for William Dugdale's History of St. Paul's Cathedral (1658). We have located two of Hollar's original drawings made in preparation for his engravings. Happily, they show the parts of the cathedral we are most interested in.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Stout-Feldman Studio in El Paso, Texas, was well known for its photographic portraits.  The studio's photographers also took pictures of faculty, staff, and organizations at the Texas College of Mines and Metallurgy--now the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).  The University Library acquired the collection in 2008 and is now doing preservation work on the collection.  An exhibit of photographs from the collection will be on display in the UTEP Library and will open on June 15, 2012.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Place names can have many variants due to not only chronological (e.g., Byzantium, Constantinople and Istanbul) or cultural/linguistic reasons (e.g., Genève, Genf, Ginevra and Geneva) but also due to differences in the exact place or area covered. The confusing connections between place names ultimately reflect the extent/lack of accurate knowledge of the textual sources as well as the changing economic and political lenses through which places were viewed. This blog post explores these issues using an example from the Red Sea.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Montana's newspapers often published brief announcements about town visitors, residents who were injured or taken ill, and guests at private gatherings. Most "personals" were one- or two-sentence snippets, but once in awhile an event was entertaining enough to qualify for more detailed treatment. &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>A question we are often asked here at the University Press is "What is this peer review thing and why is it so important?" The Oxford English Dictionary defines peer review as "The review of commercial, professional, or academic efficiency, competence, etc., by others in the same occupation" In publishing, it is the resulting professional or academic article or manuscript that is reviewed or "refereed," a term associated with Peer Review. And in doing so, the writer(s)' competency in the subject is reviewed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Barbara Grier Periodical Collection represents a rich assemblage of feminist and lesbian themed newspapers, magazines, journals, and small press publications amassed by Grier over the years. Spanning from 1969 to 1992, the bulk of the material is from the 1980s and features periodicals from large United States metropolitan areas as well as smaller towns. Diana Press was a lesbian-feminist printing and publishing house which was started by Coletta Reid and Casey Czarnik in Baltimore, MD, in 1972, then relocated to Oakland, CA, in 1977. Most notably, Diana Press published titles by such authors as Rita Mae Brown and Judy Grahn and reprinted Jeannette Foster's pioneering Sex Variant Women in Literature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An overview of the Lesbian Schoolworkers Records, which contains information regarding organizational history, principles of unity and structure, press releases, newsletters, flyers, paste-ups, and photographs. With a commitment to "fighting racism, sexism, class, and oppression within our own movement and this society," the group organized in 1977 to defeat Propositions 6 and 7. While this organization was among the many to rally against the bill, it also actively campaigned against anti-lesbian and pro-death penalty laws and sought to identify the relationship between Third World oppression and the oppression of all lesbians.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>By collecting and preserving the documentation and materials that are central to women's lives, the June Mazer Lesbian Archives preserves details of American culture that have long been invisible in archival histories.  The Diane F. Germain papers exemplify this fact. Germain is a French-American lesbian-feminist psychiatric social worker. She conducts the Lesbian History Project and created and conducted a strength group for Women Survivors of Incest and/or childhood molestation for five years. She was one of the founding members of Dykes on Hikes, The Lesbian Referral Services, Beautiful Lesbian Thespians and California Women's Art Collective. She was an early principal member of the San Diego Lesbian Organization and a collective member of both Las Hermanas and Califia, a separatist lesbian community.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>he June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives at UCLA are exciting because they allow researchers to investigate important historical institutions and events in the lesbian community from multiple angles.  The Daughters of Bilitis records collection gives the researcher a unique opportunity to understand how one of the earliest LGBTQ organizations developed during a time of profound oppression and invisibility for LGBTQ people.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the joys of working in an archive, for archivists and researchers, is coming across tantalizing mysteries. A huge range of women have donated to The June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives, ranging from public figures like Margarethe Cammermeyer to lesser-known, but no less historically important, women. Occasionally, a very intriguing collection will come with a minimum of identifying information about the woman to whom it belonged. I interviewed Stacy E. Wood, a Graduate Student Researcher working on processing the Mazer collections for UCLA, about one such collection: The Martha Foster Collection. While looking through the Mazer holdings at UCLA, Wood came across Foster's papers, which included a small amount of poetry and many striking photographs, taken in her backyard in Echo Park in the early 1930s. "They're really gorgeous," says Wood. "They almost look like test costume shots. There are hundreds of them. And I couldn't find any information about her. Even Angela Brinskele (photographer and board member of the Mazer Archive) couldn't find a death certificate or birth dates."&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the treasures of the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives at UCLA is a collection of approximately 800 photos by Angela Brinskele, Director of Communications at the Archives, which chronicle Los Angeles' lesbian community from 1991-2013 (with the majority covering the last 10 years). Brinskele first began taking photographs as a teenager in Orange County in the late 1970s.  Los Angeles is perennially a smorgasbord of images waiting to be captured, and Brinskele and her friends went to places like Chasen's Restaurant, The Beverly Hilton Hotel, and the stage door of The Merv Griffin Show to photograph stars including Bette Davis, James Stewart, Bob Hope, Audrey Hepburn, Johnny Carson, and Gene Kelly.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The audiovisual holdings of the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives make up a significant part of its contents. Graduate Student Researchers Kimberlee Granholm and Daniel Williford, who have been processing the A/V holdings, estimate that the collection contains 230 VHS recordings that are unavailable anywhere else, 60 to 70 VHS movies and other easily accessed materials, and 50 items in DVD, Matic, Beta, 16mm, 8mm, and Super 8 formats. Granholm and Williford have reviewed and processed between 150 and 200 items, and it has proven quite an exciting adventure. I met with the two of them to discuss what they have found the holdings and why these findings are so important to scholars, UCLA, the LGBT community, and anyone interested in the complete history of twentieth and twenty-first centuries..</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This blog post explores how the pioneering curator, Harald Szeemann, revitalized and expanded the Venice Biennale.  As an independent curator, nurturer of the arts, and staunch advocate of new artists, Szeemann left an enormous legacy—both intellectual and physical, that is of tremendous interest to scholars, researchers and the general public nationally and globally. The Szeemann archive, held by the Getty Research Library is currently being processed by special collections catalogers at the Getty Research Institute which was made possible in part through support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The "Project files" series will be the first to be catalogued and made publically available.  Szeemann is known for his innovative and thought- provoking exhibitions held many influential positions during his career, including his appointment as the Visual Arts Director of La Biennale di Venezia for 1999 and 200—the only person with the distinction of holding this position for more than one term. Most notably, he became the first curator to include multiple contemporary Chinese artists in a traditionally Western-oriented institution. He also juxtaposed more well-known artists with up-and-coming ones in the same spaces. Szeemann envisioned a space that would blur traditional boundaries, and preferred the international show to be more of a "melting pot," while respecting the effect of the Biennale to reinforce national identities.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This blog post explores the curatorial vision of Harald Szeemann, who in 1969 declared his independence. Resigning from the Kunsthalle Bern, the curator decided to pursue an independent career outside of traditional art institutions and to personally assume every single decision and risk in his projects, from the very first concept to the final dismantling of the exhibition. He chose "From Vision to Nail" as one of the mottos for his newly established Agency for Intellectual Guest Labor, a one-man enterprise and a conceptual tool to identify his activity in the economic, political, and artistic fields. "From Vision to Nail" could be easily applied as a catchphrase to the main section of Szeemann's archive, the Project Files, which are now open for research at the Getty Research Institute. The archive consisting of more than 500 boxes containing thousands of papers, documents the curatorial process of his more than 150 exhibitions, spanning a nearly 50-year career.  Previously scattered between Bern and Ticino, Switzerland, in the mid-1980s the archive was permanently housed on two floors of a former watch factory in Maggia, Switzerland.  The Szeemann archive is now located in the United States, through recent acquisition by the Getty Research Institute (Los Angeles, CA).  Accelerated public access to the Project Files for new scholarship, research, and artistic production has been made possible through generous funding support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW), a feminist activist organization, was founded in 1976 in Los Angeles by anti-pornography activist Marcia Womongold. The Los Angeles chapter of WAVAW was formed out of an ad hoc coalition of feminist groups who joined forces to protest a film called Snuff and the advertising campaign for the Rolling Stones album, Black and Blue.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The audiovisual materials in the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives include an assortment of home movies and recordings of speeches, conferences, dances, parades, concerts, fundraisers, socials, retreats, news stories, comedy routines, television episodes, movies, and documentaries. In addition, there are also thousands of prints, slides, and art depicting everything from the making of documentaries to events like gay pride parades, meetings, classes, camps, protests, parties, retreats, and the Dyke Olympics. As a graduate student researcher on the project, I cataloged and began the process of digitizing these materials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past three years I have been fortunate enough to process many individual collections from the Mazer Archives, each taking on its unique contours, representing both an historical moment as well as generously contributing to the collective intimacies of the lesbian archival record. Over time, one begins to recognize that almost every collection contains evidence of community involvement and organizational activities, professional commitments as well as deeply personal materials, evidence of the impossibility of separating or compartmentalizing lesbian lives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In our NEH syllabus work-session when describing a participant's response to  one of his  studies, the quote Chad shared was notable, "When we were singing the songs you felt harmony—connecting with the harmony within yourself." That's what I felt working with Chad on the Indigenous Studies project—harmony within myself. Chad has agreed to co-teach the American Cultural Dance course with me, and I think we can look forward to an inspiring course.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As we ponder, negotiate, and question the words of our visiting scholars for this National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) curriculum development project, we are challenged to discover and rethink hidden dimensions of our own identities, as well as those that have been defined for us through culture, governmental policy, religion, and what Iranian scholar Hamedraza Kohzadi terms, "overtly individualized western culture." &amp;#x0D; Kate Shanley, in her talk titled, "Finding the Right Words: Studying Indigenous ‘Gender' Through an Indigenous Method of Inquiry" tells a traditional Crow Indian story of Ihkawaleische (Hand Star) and by so doing, she identifies "storytelling" as an indigenous method of inquiry.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through my ongoing research on the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), I am engaging with broader questions about the "nature" of militarized landscapes and the production of their ecological value. In this piece, I examine how South Korean state and NGO projects configure the DMZ as a unique site of biodiversity that could provide the basis for sustainable development and also peace on the Korean peninsula. These projects, however, often depend upon a branding of the DMZ as a bounded space of pristine nature, disregarding the more complex social and political landscapes of the inter-Korean border region, of which the DMZ is just one part. This tendency to fetishize the DMZ and its "nature," moreover, disguises the ways in which global capitalism, development, and militarization are affecting other parts of the border region, areas where the majority of what is known of the "DMZ's biodiversity" exists.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"This past week marked the launch of our brand new game in the Metadata Games project: Stupid Robot. In this quick and easy arcade game, players score points by teaching the adorable robot words about the image they are presented with. Players strive to teach it one word of each length, 4-letters long to 10-letters long – but there's a catch! Stupid Robot doesn't know every word; it only knows words that other players have already taught it."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Tiltfactor is proud to announce a new collaboration with the British Library! To celebrate, Tiltfactor's Metadata Games project will launch the new tagging game Ships Tag as part of a tag event called May Day! May Day! starting midnight on May 1st.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The collaboration between the British Library and Tiltfactor presents an innovative way for public users to explore and tag the British Library' collection of over a million public domain images which were posted onto Flickr Commons in December 2013. By playing Ships Tag, players produce in-game tags which directly contribute to the Library's content knowledge. This not only helps the British Library augment its metadata, but it also greatly expands the collection's accessibility for public research, reuse, and repurposing. The entire collection, whose subjects range from intricate maps, geological diagrams, charts, illustrations, landscapes and more, is an amazing opportunity for players to be a part of the process of organizing this vast online collection."</Abstract>

Hanson Collection, which documents the history of photomechanical reproduction, the process by which photography is used to make plates for printwork. Photomechanical prints were a popular visual media form in the pre-film era. The collection traces the history of this process from its introduction in 1826, through the perfection of three-color printing at the beginning of the twentieth century."&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

Here's just a sample of them:&amp;#x0D; Can a party game inspire greater interest in science and math?&amp;#x0D; Do people act differently when they play a game on a board or on a digital device? How can we make sure people are thinking clearly and effectively, no matter what platform a game is in?&amp;#x0D; How can we inspire the highest levels of participation and engagement and elicit high-quality contributions from players of a digital crowdsourcing game?&amp;#x0D; Can a role-playing game build greater empathy, inspire new ways of thinking about social issues, and change the way players see themselves in the process?&amp;#x0D; Which of the following would be the most distressing to players: disease-stricken dogs, cats, humans, or zombies?&amp;#x0D; What could time-traveling scientists or ambitious princesses teach us about stereotypes and prejudice?"&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This blog post describes the Collections Department's collaboration with the Education department to use archival material processed through the NEH Ephemera project to support their programming.  In particular, the City Museum developed  "Surpass!" a unique program  to help at-risk students in local neighborhood schools prepare for the Regents examination in U.S. History and Government. The students made a total of five visits to the archives throughout the three month course.  The blog post describes one in which we viewed items related to the Civil War.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Queremos destacar el creciente número de enlaces a los facsímiles digitalizados y textos electrónicos, ya acercándose al millar entre las tres bibliografías y, desde luego, en continuo crecimiento, paralelo al efecto de las campañas de digitalización de las grandes bibliotecas. Limitándonos aquí a BETA, notamos que hay bibliotecas digitales importantes de la Real Academia de la Historia, de la Biblioteca de Catalunya, de la Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal, de la Fundación Lázaro Galdiano, de la Biblioteca Histórica de la Complutense, de la Bibliothèque nacional de France... De ésta, por ejemplo, podemos citar el facsímil del Cancionero de Baena, MS Esp. 37 (BETA manid 1632 http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8452204d), cuya transcripción electrónica se puede consultar en el Cancionero electrónico del siglo XV de la University of Liverpool. Destacamos como ejemplo el facsímil digitalizado del MS RES/9 de la Biblioteca Nacional de España, el Ordenamiento de Alcalá de Henares de 1348, de Alfonso XI, copiado en vida del rey por el escribano Nicolás González (BETA manid 2826). Puede consultarse asimismo el texto electrónico entre los textos legales transcritos por la Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies (Hispanic Society of America de Nueva York)&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nos últimos meses, a Torre do Tombo tem estado a digitalizar centenas de documentos da Colecção de Fragmentos. A maioria desses documentos são do século XVI mas há alguma documentação medieval. Há poucos dias, Pedro Pinto (do Centro de Estudos Históricos da Universidade Nova) encontrou, ao percorrer os novos maços digitalizados neste mês, cinco folhas da General Estoria de Afonso X, em português. Trata-se de folhas que foram cortadas e que serviram provavelmente para enchimento da encadernação de um livro. A sua preservação vai ajudar a conhecer melhor a tradição manuscrita desta tradução, tratando-se provavelmente de uma cópia de finais do século XV. Com a colaboração de Arthur L.-F. Askins, Harvey Sharrer e Mariana Leite foi possível identificar que os fragmentos abrangem porções dos capítulos 26 a 34 do Livro 7 da I Parte. Em BITAGAP online tem o Manid 5893 e o Cnum 30900.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Se anuncia la publicación en forma de libro de BITECA. Bibliografia de Textos Antics Catalans, Valencians i Balears. Biblioteques i Arxius Valencians (València, Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua - Universitat de Barcelona - Universitat de València, 2013). Este primer volumen, que recoge las descripciones de los manuscritos e impresos antiguos conservados en bibliotecas y archivos de la Comunidad Valenciana. El libro es el fruto de años de trabajo con los fondos valencianos, cuyas primeras descripciones codicológicas se remontan a un ya lejano 1991 cuando se realizó el primer desplazamiento de los colaboradores de BITECA a la ciudad del Turia. Desde entonces han seguido otros muchos viajes de estudio hasta el 2009, en que se compilaron los datos obtenidos hasta entonces para la elaboración del presente volumen. En él se ofrecen detallados estudios codicológicos y bibliográficos de los manuscritos, incunables y ediciones del siglo XVI que transmiten obra medieval catalana. Cierra el volumen un completo y útil juego de índices: de bibliotecas y ejemplares; de correspondencia entre los identificadores de BITECA y los ejemplares vinculados a bibliotecas y archivos valencianos; de correspondencia de los ejemplares impresos conservados en bibliotecas y archivos valencianos con los ejemplares principales; de autores y obras; de primeros versos; de personas e instituciones relacionadas con los ejemplares descritos en el libro y, finalmente, índice topográfico. Se incluye en el volumen un CD con el corpus completo de obras y autores (de carácter provisional) manejado en BITECA.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1765, Samson Occom, a minister and Mohegan Indian who figured largely in the founding of Dartmouth, traveled to Great Britain to solicit funds for the Indian Charity School run by Eleazar Wheelock. Occom kept a detailed journal during his tour, and in its back pages, he lists the letters he sent to America. Occom records that, in March of 1766, he wrote to "Mrs. Wheatley in Boston," noting directly underneath that he has also sent a letter "to a Negro Girl Boston." There can be little doubt that the girl to whom Occom refers is Phillis Wheatley, a slave who would have been about 12 years old at the time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The adage that "all your dysfunctional relationships have one thing in common, you" comes to mind whenever Eleazar Wheelock's legacy is up for examination. This is particularly the case with a recent acquisition of Wheelock documents (five in his hand) ranging from the time of his calling to the Second Congregational Church in Lebanon, Connecticut, in 1735 to 1771 after his arrival in Hanover.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Prof. Lamberson, co-director of the project, discusses her experience of interviewing veterans for the NEH-funded "West Texans and the Experience of War: World War I to the Present." She argues that academics must do a better job of bridging veterans' stories with ones that certain policymakers are telling about the past. She urges academics to participate more in public events.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1919, Charles Lathrop Park wrote words that would likely get the attention of today's advocates of food sovereignty, urban farming, sustainability, and the elimination of city center food deserts.  "Ambitious young men and women," he said, "will not remain in the country where comforts are denied and where advantages of social life and education are few; but they will be glad to farm in the city."  (Norwich Bulletin, Apr. 18, 1917).</Abstract>

The slides are provided as well in PDF form. She has also included several of the more interesting slides in the body of the text itself. The first part of this talk describes the digital work Sperrazza has already done on "Feeling Violation: Tactile Rendering of the Early Modern Blazon" and the second half gives an overview of how EMDA has shifted her thinking, and some ideas for new trajectories based on a new set of tools and questions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this blog post, Michael Gavin describes his work with historical text networks. He thinks of books as points of connection in a network: when printers and booksellers collaborate to distribute the work of an author, this action can be understood as a link that binds them together. Taken as a whole, these myriad ties form EEBO into a giant social field, or "hairball."</Abstract>

"Remembering G. Fox &amp;amp; Company" is part of the College's Hartford Heritage Program, made possible with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), that makes connections between course content and the cultural institutions of the city to enhance students' learning and understanding of Hartford.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Students from Humanities Chair Jeff Partridge's English 220 class will present their posters on the theme of "Stowe, Twain and Me" in Hal Holbrook Hall at the Mark Twain House &amp;amp; Museum on Wednesday, December 16th,  3 -4:30 p.m. During the fall semester the  English 220 classes were held for the first time at the Twain House museum and the adjacent Harriet Beecher Stowe Center. The off-campus course sprang from the College's Hartford Heritage Project.  The project, launched in 2010 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), has spawned learning communities, access to museums and institutions and new courses based on Hartford content.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This blog post compares the career of South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, to earlier Asian Americans prominent in electoral politics (Senators Dalip Singh Saund, Hiram Fong, Daniel Inouye). Like her predecessors, Haley has risen to prominence amidst national turmoil over race relations. All have been "model minorities"--exemplars of assimilation, political moderation, and patriotism. I argue that "model minority" characterization has not protected Haley (and others) from anti-immigrant sentiment and Islamophobia. Her story highlights the distance between the "American Dream" as an promise and the as-yet-to-be-achieved substantive reality for all Americans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Early Modern Prisons is a collective effort to find out what it was like to be locked up in the early modern period. We are interested in the economics and government of the prison, the fees, the food, how alcohol was sold, how news circulated, diseases, smells, sex, lice, irons, close confinement, charity, garnish, ancient privileges, violence, how prisoners organized and protested.  We want to know what practices of detention tell us about contemporary notions of freedom and unfreedom, and how places of detention figure in the great early modern political debates about rights, tyranny, abuse, freedom and legality.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; We are interested in all kinds of prisoners, from debtors to convicts, from prisoners of war to inmates of bridewells and plague houses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawn from both the book in progress funded by the NEH (now titled "Life upon the Exchange") and extended work conducted as part of my 2014 book Charles Dickens's Our Mutual Friend: A Publishing History (Ashgate 2014), this blog post assesses Dickens's presentation of "work" and the commodified intellectual labor of authorship as these appear in Our Mutual Friend. The blog post was written for the Our Mutual Friend Reading Project designed by the Centre for Nineteenth-Century Studies at Birkbeck, University of London.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since History Colorado joined the National Digital Newspaper Project (NDNP) in August 2016, project supervisor Kerry Baldwin and project manager Ann Sneesby-Koch have worked with the project's advisory board to select titles culled from History Colorado's collection of more than 1,000 Colorado newspapers on microfilm. Pooling the board's collective expertise in historic newspaper collections, digitization and Colorado history, we arrived at a working list of 18 titles. By September 2018, 100,000 pages from across these titles will be incorporated into Chronicling America (http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov), the fully searchable online database that provides free access to digitized US newspapers produced by the NDNP (a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The blog post describes reconstruction of paper records and overall sustainability of materials. It specifically cites the successful Papers of the War Department 1784-1800 project, and also an instance when paper records could not be reconstructed. It ends with a brief discussion of the importance and necessity of digital sustainability of records, and cites guidelines and grant programs that can help.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The first queen of England in her own right, Mary I was known as 'Bloody Mary' for her brutal persecution of Protestants. But she is also remembered for her phantom pregnancy of 1555. Perhaps a result of the queen's overwhelming desire to have a child, the peculiar episode had great political consequences for her reign.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Three Ladies in London in Context project aims to enrich early English theatre studies by introducing the work of the UK-based Performance as Research movement into the frameworks that dominate North American research and teaching. Robert Wilson's popular comedy, The Three Ladies of London, 1584, revised in 1592, is our touchstone. Shakespeare's Henry the Sixth, Part 1, performed in 1592, is our comparison case.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) is a customizable, out-of-the-box toolkit and environment that supports prosopographical research.  It is designed to solve a problem — a complex research methodology — and is not a problem or algorithm in search of a problem to which it may be applied. Prosopography is the process of  discovering, through references to personal names, familial relationships, professional designations, as well as other attributes, pictures of the social, economic, intellectual activities and connections that link them. As the foundational task of prosopography is the collecting of name instances and attributes, it is hardly surprising that prosopographers were early adopters of digital tools, especially databases, which facilitated sorting, searching, and storage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1929, it was socially acceptable for women to smoke at home and in certain public spaces, such as a hotel lobby. Smoking on the streets, however, was another matter altogether. George Washington Hill, the president of the American Tobacco Company, sought to quash this old taboo. He enlisted a public relations consultant, Edward Bernays, who had, in his years as a press agent, perfected the art of "creating circumstances" that would attract favorable coverage—and thus free publicity—in newspapers. For this job, Bernays consulted a psychoanalyst who suggested that smoking cigarettes was a sublimation of oral eroticism—to do it openly would be a dramatic symbol of women's emancipation. The cigarettes would become, the psychoanalyst said, "torches of freedom." This led Bernays to stage a parade on Easter Sunday of 10 young debutantes who would, in the interest of the "equality of the sexes," light their cigarettes and march down New York's Fifth Avenue—with male escorts—to proclaim their liberation and equality. Bernays exploited his connections with the press to ensure that the parade would be widely photographed and covered in newspapers. In the end, the march caused a national stir, and Bernays had effectively used the press to transform the progressive impulse of feminism into a boost in cigarette sales for his client.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Known for monumental works in midcentury sociology such as White Collar, The Power Elite, and The Sociological Imagination, C. Wright Mills earned a reputation as an incisive, independent social critic who exposed the biases and banalities of both elite power brokers and ordinary Americans.  Yet one of Mills's assignments early in his career had him conducting a survey in Decatur, Illinois funded by major magazine publisher, Macfadden, which was known for its sensational pulp titles like True Story.  Mills had just begun working under Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert Merton at the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University, where he would eventually join the sociology faculty.  Although he worried about how colleagues would perceive his "selling out," he quickly became engaged in the work when he began part-time in 1944 and then full-time in 1945.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 1968, the Museum has been home to a large collection of scripts, sheet music, and scores created by George M. Cohan, the most prolific theater artist in the first half of the 20th century. Cohan wrote, produced, directed, or starred in over 100 Broadway productions and penned such enduring hits as "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "You're a grand old flag," "Give my regards to Broadway", and "Over there."  Currently, anyone wishing to view this material must make a research appointment and plan to visit the Museum, and access is limited to those with the means to travel to and stay in New York City.  However, this is all about to change.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>There is a statue in Times Square that stands on the north side of 46th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue; not the Father Duffy sculpture for which the intersection is named, but a slightly smaller work found to the south of the formidable World War I priest. This statue depicts the great American song and dance man George M. Cohan. Measuring a solid three feet taller than its subject did in life, the statue celebrates a man who composed, directed, produced, or starred in over 100 Broadway productions, making him the most prolific musical theater artist in history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Before A League Of Their Own, there were "Bloomer Girls" baseball teams that barnstormed the United States from 1890s to 1934, playing local town, semi-pro, and minor league men's teams. Bloomer teams, so named after the loose-fitting trousers they wore in the fashion of suffragist Amelia Jenks Bloomer, came from midwestern, southern, and eastern states and were made up of young, single women who earned a living playing baseball in a time when women's professional options were very limited. Bloomer Girls traveled across the country, across states, and town-to-town by rail, bringing with them their own fences, tents, and grandstands.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Welcome to the Discovering Paterson: The Silk City Project blog.  Here you will find many musings, insights, and observations from the students of Passaic County Community College about the many literary, historical, and cultural connections that center around Paterson, New Jersey.  Additionally, students will share the many stories of the colorful Patersonians whom they will interview, as well as share their own original works of poetry.   Through this blog, students will learn the importance of writing for a public audience which will sharpen their mindfulness about how they express themselves.  This blog will illustrate to  students that they, too, have a voice – one that needs to be heard.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Statesman acted as a channel through which its readers could "voice their opinions, assert their rights, and demand their due recognition." The newspaper reported local, church, and society news and events, as well as national stories that would be of particular interest to African Americans residing in the Mountain West. The publication also featured op-eds about interracial marriage, Jim Crow Laws, and segregation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The international role of Dutch literature in Britain is little-known outside the Netherlands (and even there not much) since, quite simply, Dutch is not widely known. This book also aims to change that omission addressing the significance of Dutch literature at the time of the Dutch republic's global zenith. In this period there was also belief in the possibility of a European canon of letters through translation from one vernacular into many languages, and where Latin might still bear sway as a lingua franca.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My concern is to show that early modern vernacular literatures depend on each other as well as on ancient literature. The true picture of early modern European literary activity is a large network with people and texts passing through the north-west territories: the crucible of the Low Countries and northern France. Within this framework, we can observe the beginning of the serious appreciation of English literature and drama in 17th century Europe.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This interactive article explores the untold histories and legacies of the 2002 Joola shipwreck in Senegal, which killed an estimated 1,863 people. Despite more casualties than the Titanic, there has been no academic attention to the wide-reaching impact of the Joola. This article explores the incident through a geographic lens and by doing so, allows the traumatic event and the thousands of people affected to be adequately memorialized.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this essay, we show that among the various images of Prithvinarayan Shah drawn in different styles and across media in different historical periods, a painting by Amar Chitrakar came to acquire a hegemonic status as the most recognized and reprinted image of the king after the 1960s, becoming a visual trope that represents Nepali national unity under the tutelage of the Shah monarch.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is an Aesopian fable in the Renaissance? This post is about where our modern Aesopian fables come from, drawing on the Folger Shakespeare Library's incredibly rich collections of animal fables. For more detail and proper notes, I recommend the recently published volume Arthur Golding's A Moral Fabletalk and Other Renaissance Fable Translations, which I co-edited with Kathryn Vomero Santos—a copy of which is also held at the Folger.1</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chart—begun in 2014 by Cameron Kroetsch, and finished in 2018 by myself (Liza Blake) and my RA Alaheh Amini1 —gives all the locations in which copies of Cavendish's books survive. It is intended, first and foremost, as a resource for researchers, particularly those who might want to conduct bibliographical research on Cavendish's work, and those who might want to produce scholarly editions. Any scholarly edition begins with a survey of surviving copies; we hope that the labor that went into this chart helps to save the step of locating those copies for future researchers and editors. Below I describe the methodology for putting the chart together, and give a brief sketch of noteworthy findings that came out of the project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This post will describe a three-part "Editing Women Writers" set of scaffolded assignments that I used in my undergraduate course "Early Modern Women Writers" in the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM)'s Spring term of 2018. The class's evaluation was divided: half of the grades came from more typical academic assignments (a short and long paper, and quizzes), and half came from experiential learning assignments (a Transcribathon, and assignments leading up to a class-wide editing project to produce a student-made anthology of women writers). Below I describe the context for the collaborative anthology as well as the learning outcomes; describe the assignments and how they were deployed; and reflect on the success of the experiment to incorporate editing into the classroom environment. I end with some practical tips on how the assignments might be adapted or generalized for different group sizes, different levels of study, and/or different courses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The grant will allow di Rosa to restore Wind House (2003), a site-specific outdoor kinetic sculpture by Sebastopol-based artist Ned Kahn. Kahn is an internationally renowned environmental artist and sculptor — known for his work harnessing natural elements such as fire and light, fog, sand, water and wind — augmenting visibility and creating new ways to experience the world around us. Ironically, the wind-animated sculpture, which creates a gossamer suggestion of a building completely permeated by the atmosphere, was damaged by the 2017 Northern California wildfires.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The city's first major polio epidemic struck in 1916, killing nearly 2,500 people. Almost 9,000 cases were reported in total that year. Smaller outbreaks were reported over the next few decades with two occurrences in the 1940s, continuing to terrify the populace. On average, over 800 cases and 40 deaths were reported yearly. Doctors were soon developing and experimenting with preventive treatments including gamma globulin, an injectable solution made with the polio antibodies. Gamma globulin was introduced to the public in 1950 and showed some effectiveness in preventing the disease. Because the solution was made from blood, supply was limited and could not be a long-term remedy. Parents' desperation to protect their children coupled with the restricted availability of the treatment led to sit-ins and protests demanding more access to gamma globulin from the Department of Health.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Throughout the early and mid-1900s, dairy products were a significant source of foodborne illnesses. Hundreds of children died due to the consumption of milk, leading to the 1911 creation of milk stations that dispensed free pasteurized milk. During the 1930s and 40s the New York City Department of Health, under commissioners Shirley W. Wynne (1928-1933) and John L. Rice (1934-1942), took many steps to regulate the production and storage of dairy products, which were regularly consumed in high quantities by New Yorkers of all ages. Milk and ice cream were of particular concern.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A team of archivists has begun sorting through 60 years of Department of Health (DOH) records thanks to a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. During the next year, they will process 800 Bankers Boxes of historical records from 21 NYC Health Department Commissioners, ranging from Shirley W. Wynne in 1929 to Woodrow Myers in 1991. The final result will be a detailed guide to the collection. The records document New York City's long-recognized leadership role in disease prevention, vaccinations, health education, food safety, drug and alcohol addiction treatment, family planning, and health care for infants, school children, and expectant mothers. The records also show how city government reacted to, and managed, acute outbreaks of infectious illnesses such as diphtheria, measles, polio, typhoid fever, and HIV and AIDS. For example, the DOH implemented and upheld strict regulations on the production of milk to control typhoid fever outbreaks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Mary Furlong Minkoff, Curator of Archaeological Collections, and Dr. Terry P. Brock, Assistant Director of Archaeology, will be giving a presentation on Marcy 8, 2019 at the Enslaved Conference at Michigan State University. The Conference is a two-day gathering of scholars and cultural heritage professionals who are currently working on digital projects that examine slavery. The conference is part of a larger project being directed by MSU's MATRIX, which is an effort to create a digital tool linking databases and collections from around the world that focus on the historical record of slavery.  Montpelier's paper presents the scope of the Montpelier Digital Collections Project, and also examines how it will include descendant community voices in its design.  You can learn more and watch the live stream by visiting the website at http://enslaved.org. The conference hashtag is #enslaved2019.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Arctic cold did not stop them. The 1920s were known as a decade of youth fads, including pole sitting and goldfish swallowing. Connecticut youth were not left behind. The Connecticut Digital Newspaper Project is now digitizing the New Britain Herald for this decade. There will be a wealth of news about popular culture in the state during the Roaring Twenties soon available online!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>" ‘Jim Crow' was handed a dishonorable discharge from the Connecticut National Guard on March 16, 1949, when Governor Chester Bowles signed a bill outlawing segregation and discrimination on account of race, creed, or color in the military organizations of the State," said the Spring Connecticut Inter-Racial Survey. The bill was introduced by a Senator Wechsler and pushed through by the Governor to a unanimous vote.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>There was likely no topic more hotly debated in the 1920s than the conduct of youth, and especially that of young women. In response to all these charges, living modern girls and their supporters took up the pen and wrote their defense of the changed attitudes exhibited by young women who had matured during the Great War and some of these rebuttals made it into the newspapers of Connecticut.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On June 15, 1919, Connecticut union officials and city delegations joined a mass protest at the U.S. Capitol to oppose the Eighteenth Amendment, which was ratified the previous January, and to reshape the Volstead Act, the enforcement legislation that was soon to be introduced into the House of Representatives. (The Volstead Act became law on October 28, 1919.)  The marchers carried American flags and demanded that 2 ¾% beer, "the workingman's beer," and light wines be excluded from Prohibition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Here at ProfHacker, we've published a number of things over the years about accessibility in digital environments. And regular readers will remember that last September we announced the first Accessible Future workshop, which took place in Boston last semester. After Boston, we led a workshop in Austin, Texas.  Now we're accepting applications for our third workshop, which will be held on November 14 and 15, 2014 in Lincoln, Nebraska. If you are interested in digital environments and accessibility, please apply. The Accessible Future workshop is intended for humanists, librarians, information scientists, and cultural heritage professionals who wish to learn about technologies, design standards, and accessibility issues associated with the use of digital technologies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In early January 1890, an especially widespread outbreak of influenza that had quickly spread across Europe now seemed likely to reach the United States. Responding to this perceived danger, the Medical Record, a weekly journal, published an editorial on January 4, 1890, by Dr. George F. Shrady, which proclaimed with great certainty that a disease "of such a mild type" did not pose any serious danger to the American people. After describing common symptoms and recommended treatments for a disease popularly known as "the grip," Shrady reassured the public that "the epidemic of influenza" was neither unusual nor dangerous. This editorial quickly reached a much broader audience when newspapers across the United States republished most or all of the text or referenced the journal's authoritative statements about the disease. By examining the dissemination of information along with the spread of disease, this case study explores the complex relationship between medical expertise and public sentiments during a public health crisis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historical medical journals provide unique perspectives on the development of expert understanding of transmission, morbidity, and impact during an epidemic. Examining the ways that medical journals contributed to the spread of information, evaluation of interpretations, and creation of new knowledge in a specific historical process can contribute to current discussions about the relationship between expert perspectives and public understanding. Information on the Russian Influenza (1889–1890) in the British Medical Journal offers an excellent case study for evaluating historical significance and contemporary relevance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The history of the Bible in Arabic includes not only the reception of its textual content, and the reworking of its stories and themes in various forms of "rewritten Bible," but also the reimagining of the Bible as a concept—in the minds of Muslims as well as Jews and Christians. One particularly curious example of rewritten Bible is an Arabic text purporting to be the "Psalms of David," written by a Muslim to fit a Qur'anic conception of the Zabur. Rather than human prayers and praises addressed to God, this collection of one hundred "suras" takes the form of a divine revelation spoken by God to the prophet David, full of pious admonitions about the enticements of this world and the terrors of the next.

		<Abstract>We are delighted to announce the launch of our new Intertextual Networks series on the open-access Women Writers in Context platform! Intertextual Networks is a three-year research project funded by a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, focusing on intertextuality in early women's writing. This collaborative research initiative examines the citation and quotation practices of the authors represented in Women Writers Online (WWO) to explore and theorize the representation of intertextuality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The JDC Archives was recently awarded a 2017 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The grant will fund a preservation assessment of its Artifacts and Ephemera Collection by an expert consultant and the purchase of preservation supplies.  When curating the JDC's centennial exhibit at the New York Historical Society in 2014, it became clear that the presence of artifacts and ephemera in the exhibition helped immensely to illustrate and bring to life JDC's efforts and impact over the years. This exhibition was the catalyst for the establishment of the Artifacts and Ephemera Collection, which today contains over 750 works ranging from posters and illuminated records to precious artwork and gifts from Jewish communities around the world. However, due to the fragility of rare items received from survivors and other aid recipients over the past century, it is critical to now take steps to preserve this historical record. This grant will enable the JDC Archives to maintain effective stewardship of this newly catalogued collection and render it accessible to researchers and curators around the world.</Abstract>

The grant funded a preservation assessment of our Artifacts and Ephemera Collection by an expert consultant, and the purchase of preservation supplies. The grant also unexpectedly led to the discovery of new information pertaining to the past life of materials.Through the detailed examination of a rare album created in the British detention camps on Cyprus, the project helped us in a unique way to understand artifact provenance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Is it acceptable to teach a popular culture adaptation of a canonical text as a substitute for the original literary work? What, if anything, is lost when students view a film adaptation of Great Expectations as opposed to reading Dickens's nineteenth-century novel? And is there ever a good reason for students who are capable of reading Romeo and Juliet to study a graphic novel adaptation of Shakespeare's play instead? We assume we aren't the only English teachers to have wrestled with these questions. And yet we hear these ideas described as problematic because some teachers assume that popular culture and canonical literature exist in an antagonistic relationship. When teachers create opportunities for students to experience and produce literary adaptations, they invite them to participate in a practice that is arguably as old as the institution of literature itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>All web histories are marked by their absences – by what cannot be captured in a dynamic and often-changing environment of code, objects, pages, sites and spheres.[1] But web sounds are doubly vulnerable. First, most of the web archiving tools available today, like the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, Archive.Today or Pinboard, are primarily built on visual metaphors and thus neglect, or at least push to the background, the role of audio. Second, preserving audio formats often requires preserving the sounds themselves as well as the technologies on which to play those sounds. Like so many other digital media, web audio is hard to hear not just because it is hard to find and save but because it is hard to know what to save along with it to make it playable in the future. Driscoll and Diaz's claim that ‘the role of music, sound, and noise in computer games remains relatively under examined'[2] also applies to web sounds more generally, and even more acutely to attempts to preserve the longer history of the web's soundscapes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Podcasts, like so many artifacts of digital culture, are unstable objects. As downloadable files, podcasts can be moved, copied and played and so they seem stable enough to save easily. In fact, for the first decade or so of podcasting's existence (and for many non-ad-supported podcasts still), they were largely static and unchanging. But as the podcasting industry grows up and experiments with new forms of, and technologies for, advertising and monetization, the coherence of the audio file is more in question now than it ever has been. Should a database account for these multiple versions?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We are, as commentators have noted, in the midst of a "Golden Age of Podcasts"; a moment where the choice for quality digital audio abounds, and where new voices and listeners connect daily through earbuds, car stereos, home speakers or office computers. Depending on how you define it, podcasting is either just over 10 years old, more than 20 years old, or merely the latest soundwave in radio's much longer history. [1] However you date it, in the decade since 2004 when the term "podcasting" was inadvertently coined the format has exploded: there are now over 300,000 podcasts and 8 million episodes in over 100 languages, with new ones launching every day. [2]  Given how ubiquitous and available podcasts are, you might assume they would not face the same preservation risks as, say, old radio tape reels, transcription discs or celluloid film stock. Podcasts are largely free and their near-instant availability on multiple devices makes them seem as if they are in endless supply. They take up relatively few megabytes, which makes it easy to store a lot of them, and they are often available through multiple channels and aggregators (iTunes, Stitcher, SoundCloud, etc.). But podcasts are surprisingly vulnerable; podcast feeds end abruptly, cease to be maintained, or become housed in proprietary databases, like iTunes, which are difficult to search with any rigor. Many podcasts get put behind paywalls as they get popular, or as back catalogues become a potential source of revenue. Then there's the precarity of the very platforms that help make up podcasting's diffuse and sometimes DIY infrastructure: I recently heard from an independent podcaster who had been hosting their show via the file management app/website Dropbox, but once that company made significant changes to its "public folder" feature, the podcaster was left scrambling to find another solution for where to host their files (and had to return to older shows to update the URLs and locations of new files).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Summer seems like the obvious time to contemplate the long history of American religion outdoors, and to think through the intersection of religious institutions with the natural world at a site familiar to many of us: summer sleep-away camp. In the early twentieth century, Catholic writers and educators urged their fellow laymen and women build new recreational possibilities for children that were both American and Catholic. While the potential of summer camps to reform and revitalize the Catholic boy was often the center of these conversations, Catholic girls and young women were also invited to participate in a range of new summer activities, and often made them their own.</Abstract>

In the process, our intellectual work has taken turns we never envisioned. We hope that our discussions and approaches can push us all as historians to think about what collaboration looks like in our field, the expansive kind of work it can produce, and how we might infuse worth into undervalued aspects of collaboration.</Abstract>

Intertextual Networks is a three-year research project funded by a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, focusing on intertextuality in early women's writing. This collaborative research initiative examines the citation and quotation practices of the authors represented in Women Writers Online (WWO) to explore and theorize the representation of intertextuality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bonnie Cashin, one of the "Mothers of American Sportswear," had a 40-year long career in which she created some of the most unique and original designs for women that played a certain role, not just followed fashion trends. As often happens in the world of fashion, successful designs are copied without credit going to the originators of those designs. Designers such as Raf Simons for Calvin Klein in 2018 have been singled out in Stephanie Lake's Instagram account, Cashincopy, to show the blatant line for line copying of Cashin's designs without proper credit being given to the woman with the design originality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rhizomes of Mexican American Art since 1848 is, fundamentally, a decolonial strategy to make available the rich aesthetic and documentary history of art produced by and about Mexican America. Because Rhizomes will allow online users to search and interact with the holdings and collections of libraries, archives, and museums (LAM) across the United States, we depend upon relationships and technical connections. While these two types of linkages may appear equally significant, we privilege relationships. Whereas Digital Humanities scholars privilege technological sustainability (the robust nature of the tool, infrastructure, fixity, and interoperability), Rhizomes emphasizes relationships.There is no software or hardware solution for technological obsolescence that will support the ongoing function and growth of Rhizomes. Relationships between our team and our partner institutions will provide the foundation for sustainability.   With such relations and connections, Rhizomes can grow its deep, horizontal, and vertical roots. The protocol clarifies how we do this work and reflects why we are doing this work. Imagined as an alternative to Eurocentric, colonial, or siloed collections, Rhizomes depends upon decolonial methods for collaboration that emphasize equity, transparency, trust, and reciprocity. Just as we welcome partner institutions into the Rhizomes community, our partners allow us to join them in their ongoing stewardship of Mexican American art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Newberry Library and the National Council on Public History (NCPH) are pleased to announce that "Chicago 1919: Confronting the Race Riots" has earned the 2020 Outstanding Public History Project Award. The NCPH presents the award annually to a project "that contributes to a broader public reflection and appreciation of the past or that serves as a model of professional public history practice." In 2019, the Newberry Library--in partnership with 13 cultural organizations in Chicago--led Chicago 1919, a year-long initiative commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1919 Chicago race riots. The NEH-funded project engaged scholars, teachers, activists, poets, journalists, filmmakers, and citizens in a series of community conversations about the decisive role the riots played in cementing racial division in Chicago.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This blog post by project faculty was written in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It incorporates insights and material on epidemiology and public health that were developed for the course "History of Science." In addition it discusses a published interview that project consultant Emily Hamilton, Ph.D. (previously Redman) did with MassLive.com about the similarities between the 1918 Flu Pandemic and the COVID-19 outbreak. We have maintained a close working relationship with Dr. Hamilton since working with her on the grant project. More specifically, this post incorporates project material with local Dean College history from the era of the 1918 Pandemic and discusses student responses. Students across our history curriculum learned about this material during the Spring 2020 semester.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At a critical historical juncture following Hitler's rise to power, an Austrian political scientist helped to coordinate a profoundly consequential intellectual migration to the United States. Walter Maria Kotschnig (1901–1985) was well-positioned to respond to the crisis of refugee scholars caused by the Nazi Reich's law to "restore" the professional civil service, which went into effect in April of 1933 and led to the immediate dismissal of more than a thousand academics in Germany. In his official capacities at the International Student Service and at the High Commission for Refugees (Jewish and Other) Coming from Germany, Kotschnig became an important negotiator between the various ad hoc committees that formed to find positions for the hundreds of displaced German scholars, many of whom would come to the U.S. to re-establish their careers. When the German crisis became a continental crisis with the Anschluss of Austria in 1938, many of the procedures and relationships that Kotschnig had worked to establish through the committees became the framework for the relocation of émigré scholars whose careers were terminated by the Nazi regime on the basis of their political identity as socialists, communists, or liberals, or because of their "racial" identity as "non-Aryans" or Jews.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When I ask my college students to name a suffragist, most of them name Susan B. Anthony. Over a century after her death, many even recognize her picture. In 1979, she became the first woman whose portrait appeared on a circulating coin in the United States. A recent study by the National Women's History Museum reveals that many states require students to learn about her. Soon, the first statue of historical women in Central Park will feature Anthony and fellow reformers Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth.  How did Anthony's face become so visible? Anthony was one of many women's rights activists, but she was one of the few who dedicated her time to distributing portraits of reformers like herself. Anthony spent significant effort and money to mold the public image of the women's rights movement.   Anthony borrowed visual strategies from the antislavery reformers, especially from Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. Douglass and Truth sold their portraits to provide a model of black leadership that countered racist and sexist cartoons. Similarly, Anthony wanted to challenge cartoons that mocked female reformers. She distributed portraits to define the leaders of the movement and emphasize that women—especially well-off white women—could be public leaders, perhaps even president. Anthony's portraits established a model for female leadership and defined which suffragists we most often remember today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A story pulled from the LOOK Magazine photo assignments about Hattie McKeever, who had a wax works shop in Coney Island, provided wax figures to the World in Wax Musee on Surf Avenue.  Ms. McKeever began her career at the Eden Musee in Manhattan, where she started out selling catalogs, before becoming a costumer and eventually a wax artist. The Eden closed in 1915, its collection transferred to Coney island, and Ms. McKeever with it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The world around Menokin may be moving slow but work on the ruin at Menokin is just speeding up. The stabilization process is in full swing. As Alice French, Director of Education and Public Programming, discussed in a recent post, the first phase of the process involves the removal of Calder's Corner. Calder's Corner is the corner of the house that contains the south side and the west side. The mason team under Oak Grove Restoration has taken on this project. The stones from the wall have been removed and their location has been recorded, in case they are put back in later phases of the stabilization. With the removal of the walls, the archaeology on Calder's Corner began. Menokin's archaeology team is from the Fairfield Foundation and is headed by Thane Harpole.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Back in 2015, the ANS launched PELLA (numismatics.org/pella) as our rst foray into creating dedicated online tools with a focus on ancient Greek numismatics, modeled on those we had already created for Roman coinage such as Online Coins of the Roman Empire. More recently, after we were awarded a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2017 for the Hellenistic Royal Coinages (HRC) project. PELLA was incorporated into HRC as one of its several components. Even as we've continued to build out the other components of HRC, including Seleucid Coins Online and Ptolemaic Coins Online, we've been working on adding new features to PELLA as well. Just this week, in fact, we finished adding to PELLA a catalogue and typology for the gold and silver coinage of Philip II.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the more enigmatic aspects of ancient Greek coinage, and Hellenistic coinage in particular, are the many symbols and monograms that appear on them. Already in the early fth century BC, some coin producers, such as the exiled Samians in Zancle in Sicily, began to put letters and symbols on their coins that served functions beyond just identifying the political authority, like the abbreviated ethnic, ?T?, that appeared on early Athenian coinage identifying the Athenians as the producers of the new owl coinage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ruling over much of Macedonia starting with Antigonus I Monophthalmus (the "One-Eyed", r. 306–301 BC), the Antigonid dynasty of Hellenistic kings produced some of the most attractive and important coinages of the late 4 through 2 centuries BC. Curiously, however, Antigonid coinage has not attracted a great deal of concentrated scholarly attention since Edward T. Newell's work on it roughly a century ago. That situation now is rapidly changing as a number of Greek scholars, notably Sophia Kremydi, ANS Visiting Scholar in 2009, and Katerina Panagopoulou, have offered recent monographs on the coinages of selected Antigonid dynasts. Kremydi's 2018 volume, ‘Autonomous' Coinage under the Late Antigonids (Melethmata 79) provides up-to-date overviews of the coinages of Philip V (r. 221–179 BC) and Perseus (r. 179–168 BC), while Panagopoulou's about-to-be-published volume, The Early Antigonids: Coinage, Money, and the Economy (ANS 2020), looks closely at the coinage of Antigonus II Gonatas (r. 277–274; 272–239 BC). As part of this broader push to re-evaluate Antigonid coinage, we are pleased to announce the launch of Antigonid Coinage Online (AGCO).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This piece focuses on the California governor's recent use of the (famous Dante (mis)quotation--"those maintaining neutrality in times of moral crisis occupying the hottest place in Hell"--to urge action against systemic racism. I rehearse the history of the "neutrality quote"—with links to your important work on the topic—and give my take on it and Dante's context, ending with a tribute to the late John Lewis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Delta Center for Culture &amp;amp; Learning at Delta State University plays a critical role in bringing the history and culture of the Mississippi Delta to the public. In addition to hosting an annual NEH Landmarks Workshop for School Teachers, "The Most Southern Place on Earth," the center runs the International Delta Blues Project and manages the Mississippi Delta National Heritage Area (MDNHA). NHA recently completed a survey of the Delta Center's Landmarks Workshop that explores the program's longlasting impact on participants. Through qualitative and quantitative data, the results demonstrate that the program rejuvenates teachers, helps them incorporate creative and engaging pedagogies into their classrooms, and encourages continued professional development and strong professional networks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For over 50 years, the NEH has gathered K-12 teachers—over 90,000 to date—from across the country together every summer for intensive workshops which immerse them in diverse subjects and introduce engaging teaching methods. Through our NEH for All initiative, we're conducting research that demonstrates how these NEH workshops help keep effective teachers engaged in the profession despite the many challenges that have made teacher retention a national issue.  We recently surveyed 137 alumni of one such workshop, The Most Southern Place on Earth, hosted by Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi for ten years. Respondents credited this NEH-funded professional development opportunity with keeping them engaged in the essential endeavor of educating the next generation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our plans to create more space for books are about to become a reality. With grant support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, along with generous help from the University of Arizona Libraries, we will install a new shelving system in our Archives room this winter. The new shelving system, supplied by Phoenix-based firm Interior Solutions, will give us space to house the next 15-20 years of library acquisitions. To complete this major installation, we will close the library to the public in the break between the fall and spring semesters: the library will be closed to visitors from Dec. 17-Jan. 21.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In working on the Historical Index of the Medieval Middle East (HIMME), questions often arise of the form whether something or someone mentioned in one source is the same place or person as mentioned with the same name in a different source.  I call this mini-research: usually all it requires is looking up the passage in each source and comparing what it says.  But sometimes it requires more, as I experienced today when I was led on a chase through four medieval sources in three different languages (five if you count modern translations!) by my attempt to determine whether a "chapel of St. John" mentioned by a thirteenth-century Latin pilgrim might be the same as a "church of St. John" mentioned by a twelfth-century Syriac historian-patriarch.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ms Fr. 640 was written in French by an unknown craftsperson in Toulouse, likely between 1580 and 1600. [1] It is an intriguing and eclectic source, with entries ranging from medical recipes to metalwork and pigment-making, and it forms the core of the Making and Knowing Project at Columbia University, introduced previously on the Recipes Blog in a post by our Director, Pamela Smith.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Beyond Line: The Art of Korean Writing, on view in the Resnick Pavilion, focuses on the history of Korean writing and calligraphy, long considered one of the highest art forms in Korea. It is the inaugural exhibition to emerge from The Hyundai Project: Korean Art Scholarship Initiative at LACMA, a global exploration of traditional and contemporary Korean art through research, publications, and exhibitions. In this interview, exhibition co-curator and LACMA assistant curator of Korean art Virginia Moon talks about the exhibition and what Korean calligraphy says about the people who created it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>2020 is unlikely to be recorded in the history books as a particularly fashionable year, as many of us have turned to neck-up ‘zoom-ready' looks, elasticated waistbands, and slippers for comfort. But it has been sartorially remarkable for the almost-overnight success of one formerly niche accessory: the mask. As countries mandate their use in public spaces to combat the spread of Covid-19, many of us have started to wear masks for the first time, and they have become an essential part of one's outfit. Choice of materials and maker has become important as consumers are chastised for their mask selection. Designers have capitalised on the opportunity to brand and monetise the public health crisis, while those of us with sewing skills have started cottage industry production lines to provide them for friends and family. Single use non-biodegradable masks are filling landfills by the billion, and the medical industry is asking us to reserve the highest quality of N-95 masks for healthcare professionals. Cloth masks with bright prints, beaded ties and even ruffled edges have become big business, and, you can turn to Vogue to discover the most stylish (and expensive) options on the market. Wearing – or not wearing – a mask is a political, medical, and ethical act, but it can also be a fashion statement. Masks might be ‘new' accessories in the wardrobes of this generation, but they have a long history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nearly 200 friends of Nevelson Chapel gathered for a salon discussion "Public Art: Should We Value It?" tracing the evolution of contemporary art beyond the confines of the gallery and museum and exploring present-day issues — access, interpretation, invigoration — at a time of constrained funding for public art. The wide-ranging forum — featuring artist Leonardo Drew, professor Michele Bogart, and civic-art curator Kendal Henry, in conversation with Pastor Jared Stahler — had a festive air.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When it became clear to art conservator Sarah Nunberg that the lighting, along with the heating and cooling system, in Chapel of the Good Shepherd was contributing to the deterioration of Louise Nevelson's sculpture, she and the team from Saint Peter's Church began looking for solutions. They needed an approach to solve the problems for the long-term, and they needed to find funding for the improved care. Nunberg knew that the museum field had been exploring new approaches to designing and managing systems for controlling the conditions for collections items, and that the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) had a program to support that work: Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Saint Peter's Church has received two significant grants for the ground-breaking restoration of Louise Nevelson's 1977 masterwork Chapel of the Good Shepherd. The Henry Luce Foundation has awarded $250,000 to the project and the National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded $350,000. Each grant is prominent on its own. The receipt of both, together, is remarkable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digital technologies have created the opportunity to share oral history interviews in new ways, as evidenced by the many projects we discuss here on the blog and in the journal's media reviews. The educational nonprofit, Clio, offers a place-based website and mobile interface to experience history where it happened. A recent update allows integration of audio files into the app, and our guest authors discuss ways oral historians can connect their interviews to the physical environment.   Dr. Thompson and Dr. Trowbridge share how organizations and scholars around the country have used Clio to embed oral histories and other sources along with context into the physical landscape via Clio.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Canneries were built in response to the environment. This series is a summary of some of Alaska's canneries and the landscape features that defined where and how they developed. The overall period of significance for canneries in Alaska begins in 1878, when the first two canneries opened, and ends in 1936, when salmon production peaked. While some of these canneries no longer exist, the landscapes continue to tell of the history and importance of that period in the commercial fishing industry.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court for their scheduled playoff game against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night, in protest of the police shooting of a Black man named Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., they were not alone. On Wednesday and Thursday, not only were NBA playoffs and WNBA games delayed, but athletes from Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer also refused to take to the field; football practices were nixed and hockey games postponed. And the Bucks' decision to strike was also part of a longer history of intersecting race and labor struggles in the NBA. In fact, decades ago, another Milwaukee Buck, legendary guard Oscar Robertson, played a key role in establishing the political power of basketball players—and without his earlier actions, the current team would likely have been unable to make this week's powerful statement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On June 23-26, we welcomed 32 digital humanities (DH) researchers and professionals to the Building Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining (Building LLTDM) Institute. Our goal was to empower DH researchers, librarians, and professional staff to confidently navigate law, policy, ethics, and risk within digital humanities text data mining (TDM) projects—so they can more easily engage in this type of research and contribute to the further advancement of knowledge. We were joined by a stellar group of faculty to teach and mentor participants. Building LLTDM is supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When Bettye LaVette sings "to be free," the recent Blues Hall of Fame inductee opens a door and steps into the light. LaVette's new album Blackbirds is inspired by the African American women she sees as her musical forerunners. The concluding track, "Blackbird," the Beatles song she has performed in concert for a decade, crowns the record.  But don't read the last chapter first. LaVette's "Blackbird" is to Blackbirds what "A Day in the Life" is to Pepper. The eight tracks preceding "Blackbird" are interpretations of songs popularized by Black women, such as Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, Ruth Brown, and Della Reese. Several came out prior to the album's August 28 issue. LaVette's stirring take on "Strange Fruit," for example, was released in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter protests this summer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For those seeking uplift in this new pandemic world with the old-familiarity of the Stones or the Beatles, Wash's Love and Conflict is for you—for more reasons than one. Wash is the iconic voice you've known for all these years though you might not even realize it. As one-half of the Weather Girls, Wash sang "It's Raining Men," a veritable 80s anthem, ubiquitous in aerobics studios and gay dance clubs. Before that, she and fellow Weather Girl, Izora Rhodes-Armstead, flanked Sylvester James as his backup singers, Two Tons O' Fun.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Conservators of modern and contemporary artworks face a range of challenges from treating works done in unorthodox materials, such as polyurethane plastics, to seemingly non-material performance works that exist only fleetingly in real time. Their responsibility to preserve and maintain objects that resist traditional art historical and conservation taxonomies, however, has shaped the development of art conservation theory beyond modern and contemporary art and has inspired me to critically examine how we approach the preservation of cultural heritage today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A grant of over $300,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities is going to help the University of Texas Libraries contribute to the customization of a Wikipedia-like platform for the collaborative transcription, translation and indexing of archival texts in non-English languages.  The project – "Enabling and Reusing Multilingual Citizen Contributions in the Archival Record" – grew out of a need to provide more accessible digital scholarship platforms for non-English literate archival partners in Latin America. The initial phase of this project will provide an option for non-English literate communities to meaningfully engage and contribute to the Digital Humanities through the interface internationalization and translation of an open source digital scholarship platform.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Language of Flower genre is at the intersection of botany, horticulture, natural history, art, poetry, and women's studies.  This popular literary trend in the 19th century, presented the world of botany through dictionaries of flowers and associated meanings, floral poetry and prose, offering a sentimental view of natural history.  A properly arranged bouquet was said to convey a "secret message" for the recipient. The "social media" of its day, this Victorian fad, led to many editions of works published, with multiple titles by successful authors.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although at first robust, the Norman rulers' patronage of monasteries appears to have waned significantly after the death of Roger I in 1101. Certain regions were focuses of monastic activity whereas others were relatively untouched. As for the spiritual patrons these communities honored, they, too, became more restricted as time went on.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Sanctuary of the Great Gods at Samothrace is full of mysteries. Deep in the central sanctuary, however, snuggled up against the ravine, is a building that does not seem too mysterious at first glance – the Altar Court. It is a square building that had a beautiful marble façade with Doric columns and an inscription. Once you take a closer look, though, this building turns out to be just as mysterious as the ancient rites that drew pilgrims to the rocky island for centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During 2020, the NEDCC Preservation Services team developed some creative ways to help organizations move forward with their preservation initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Since onsite preservation needs assessment visits were greatly reduced due to public health mandates, the staff designed a hybrid approach that incorporates strict safety protocols, limited in-person interaction, and extended online availability, allowing this critical planning work to move ahead.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To best provide digital assessment training, we decided to "take the temperature" of digital collections management and preservation practices at the small- to mid-sized organizations that would benefit from this assessment. Questions we aimed to answer included: How much digitization is taking place? How are the resulting digital objects being managed? Do staff have the resources they need to steward digital collections? And finally, what information do they need, so that we may offer it?  We conducted two surveys: one in 2016 and one in 2018. We wanted to compare the results to see the growth or decline in different areas of digital collections management. We had the results professionally analyzed by data analysts who are also archivist-librarians – a perfect match! While the number of participants in each survey year varied (748 in 2016 and 286 in 2018), The analysts were able to observe significant findings, interpret trends, and draw evidence-based conclusions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To maximize the reach and impact of Building LLTDM, we have now published a comprehensive open educational resource (OER) of the contents of the institute. The OER covers copyright (both U.S. and international law), technological protection measures, privacy, and ethical considerations. It also helps other digital humanities professionals and researchers run their own similar institutes by describing in detail how we developed and delivered programming (including our pedagogical reflections and take-aways), and includes ideas for hosting shorter literacy teaching sessions. The resource (available as a web-book or in downloadable formats such as PDF, EPUB, and MOBI) is in the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication, meaning it can be accessed, reused, and repurposed without restriction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Formed out of the civil rights movement, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives was established in 1967 to create community-based economic development opportunities throughout the rural South for black farmers and rural communities. As the organization grew from a tiny office in Atlanta so did their vision for the future. Member cooperatives voiced a great need for practical vocational training and the FSC decided to build a training center to meet these demands.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the past 53 years, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/ Land Assistance Fund has dedicated their time and effort to serving disadvantaged Black farmers, land owners and cooperatives. It is no secret that since 1920 Black farmers have faced incredible pressures politically, socially and environmentally, forcing a decline of Black farmland ownership. In 1989 in "The Minority Farmer: A Disappearing American Resource," a report issued by the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Governmental Operations, it was feared that "minority operated farmers [were on] the verge of extinction." A 1982 Civil Rights Commission report noted that "...unless government policy is changed, there will be virtually no black farm operators by the year 2000." Black-owned land still exists in the year 2021, but the pressures to limit Black land ownership remain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Water is something that is on our minds often here in South Louisiana. How will it be managed? How can it be moved to a more convenient place? And during those times when it is simply uncontrollable, how can its damage be mitigated? To the farmers of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives (FSC), water is a way of life. It is life-giving to their crops and vital to their shipping, but too much can be a destructive force with the potential to wipe out their livelihoods. The manipulation of water is one of the keys to agriculture and an advanced society, and education surrounding that subject appears as an organizational priority within the records of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, highlighted within the collection's moving image materials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Collection on Theatrical Broadsides is an artificial collection physically united by Morgen Stevens-Garmon, Associate Curator for the Theater Collection, in 2015, in order to better accommodate their continued preservation and access, and assess their conservation needs. As an artificial collection, the Collection on Theatrical Broadsides consists of objects from dozens of individual gifts donated to the Museum between 1928 and 1996. The majority of the material was donated either by audience members or collectors of theatrical memorabilia, few of whom had any connection to the professional theatrical world. Maintaining this material as an artificial collection based on subject matter allows for faster and more comprehensive organization and description, and is consistent with Museum practice in relation to its ephemera collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nathaniel Willis was the first of several great literary men in his family, including his grandson, author and poet, Nathaniel Parker Willis. Willis published the Independent Chronicle and Universal Advertiser in Boston during the American Revolution. He also participated in the Boston Tea Party and served as an adjutant in the Continental Army. Willis sold his interest in the Chronicle in 1784 and relocated to Winchester, Virginia, as the editor of Willis's Winchester Gazette &amp;amp; Public Advertiser. He moved to Shepherdstown in 1790 and began to print the Potowmac Guardian and Berkeley Advertiser before moving a third time to Martinsburg, where the paper underwent two name changes (the Potomak Guardian and Berkeley Advertiser in 1795 and the Potomak Guardian in 1798). Willis presented his paper as a source of national and international news that curious readers could comment on through letters to the editor. Although the content on the first page varied, the second and third usually contained articles on major events and speeches from significant political figures. The fourth concluded with poetry, titled the "Seat of the Muses," and a series of advertisements.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Martinsburg Independent, formerly the Martinsburg Weekly Independent, could proudly claim in 1900 that it was the oldest newspaper in Berkeley County. The first editorial partnership, the Independent Printing Co., published the Weekly Independent and its successor from 1873 to 1879. They knew "that an independent, courageous newspaper, one that should be the reflex of no single man's mind, that should be free from party trammels, and which would express its honest judgment without fear or favor, was needed in Berkeley County." The eight sheets that comprised the Martinsburg Independent contained local news, national news, poems and stories, and advertisements. The editors printed material critical of both parties, including their preferred party, the Republicans. In the waning days of Reconstruction, they published a special dispatch denouncing Republicans "for the wrongs which they have, since 1865, heaped upon the Southern white people." The dispatch seemed to verify the Independent's position as a paper "Unawed by Influence, and Unbribed by Gain." The Independent did not hesitate to share its opinions, even when that meant crossing party lines.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thanks to the National Digital Newspaper Program, the WVRHC has been able to make more newspapers available digitally through Chronicling America.  Check out the full list of newspapers currently available for West Virginia, arranged by city.  You can use these newspapers to do historical research, to search for the names of relatives or famous people, to marvel at the clever advertisements of yesteryear, and you can also use them to find fun recipes. To celebrate the latest group of digitized newspapers going up online, I decided to look for a fun recipe to test, and I found one I loved in The McDowell Times issue from March 14, 1941.  You can take a look at the newspaper page in question to see this and other recipes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Republicans of Berkeley County once bemoaned how difficult it was to edit a political paper when "the Republican backbone" in Berkeley "was weakened by Democratic domination." This perceived difficulty did not prevent editors A. S. Goulden and John T. Reily from establishing the Martinsburg Herald in 1881. A thoroughly Republican paper, the Martinsburg Herald retained its original management until 1885, when Reily purchased Goulden's interest in the paper and associated himself with George F. Evans, a manufacturer of cigars and wholesale dealer in tobacco. In addition to being a Republican paper, the Martinsburg Herald was "A Weekly Family Journal—Devoted to Home Interests, Local News, &amp;amp;c." It followed a fairly consistent format: the first page contained literature, the second political reports, the third local news, and the fourth advertisements.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In late May 1862, United States soldiers of the 44th Ohio Infantry occupied the abandoned offices of the Greenbrier Weekly Era in Lewisburg, western Virginia. Having recently emerged victorious in the Battle of Lewisburg and perhaps faced with the boredom of occupation, the soldiers set about publishing a newspaper they christened the Yankee. Though the Federals only managed to print a single issue before evacuating the town, the Yankee's four pages reveal the hardening attitudes of Federal soldiers and the arrival of "hard war" in 1862 western Virginia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In her 1992 speech on the history of Juneteenth, given at the Washington Carver African American Arts Camp, Historian (and WVU alum) Dr. Ancella Bickley spoke of the impact of the Emancipation Proclamation in West Virginia. The Senatorial debate on the admission of West Virginia into the United States made clear that Statehood would not be granted if West Virginia did not make provisions for limiting or the outright abolition of the enslavement of African Americans in West Virginia. Waitman T. Willey introduced an amendment to the West Virginia Constitution, which was eventually approved by West Virginia voters, Congress, and then President Lincoln. The Willey Amendment established a gradual emancipation of some enslaved people in the soon-to-be state of West Virginia, rather than the complete abolition of slavery. Under the Willey Amendment, only enslaved people under the age of 25 would have been emancipated. This means West Virginians were enslaved until the Emancipation Proclamation and the State's adoption of the 13th Amendment on the 3rd of February 1865. Dr. Bickley recalls that enslaved people in West Virginia "may not have been told of their freedom and like Mollie Gabe of Braxton County, continued in servitude until her mother sent her uncle to fetch her".</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With six broods of periodical cicadas covering almost the entire state, West Virginia certainly has its fair share of history with the cicadas. Every seventeen years like clockwork once the ground warms to 64° F eight inches underground, the cicadas begin to emerge, and given their predictability, newspapers publish articles warning and educating those within range of the incoming invasions.  One of my favorite newspaper articles comes from the Ceredo Advance in May 1911. In the article, the author, John E. Watkins, describes the oncoming emergence of not just one but two broods, one of the 17-year broods and one of the 13-year broods. He remarks on how he and everyone living in his time would never witness both broods emerge simultaneously again. While this emergence occurred mostly in New Jersey, it was interesting to see how the news made its way to West Virginia. After all, there's nothing like a cicada to get you to brood about your mortality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since we are a week away from the anniversary of her birth (August 16, 1913), I'd like to celebrate Helen Louise (Froelich) Holt.  She was the wife of Rush Dew Holt, who was generally credited with being the youngest popularly elected senator in the U.S. Senate, and she was a very educated woman and a public servant in her own right.  The WVRHC houses a collection of her papers.   Helen Holt was more academically accomplished than most women of her day, and had a career in education before moving into politics.  She received an AA degree at Stephens College, and then a Bachelors degree and an MS in Zoology at Northwestern University by 1938.  (For contrast, only 4% of women in 1940 had completed four years of college.)  From 1938-1941, she taught science courses at National Park College.  According to an obituary, Mrs. Holt first attracted her future husband's attention when she was included in the February 12, 1940 issue of Life, where a photograph of her appeared as one of a selection of pretty schoolteachers.  The two-page spread was allegedly prompted by mass retaliation to a letter from a reader claiming that many schoolteachers were ugly.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The ONE Archives at the USC Libraries is excited to share the news that collections from two of the earliest gay and lesbian organizations in the United States, ONE Incorporated and Mattachine Society, are now accessible through the USC Digital Library. Thanks to a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), thousands of administrative records and correspondence files from these collections are now digitized and available online. Materials digitized through this project shed light on the pre-Stonewall years of the LGBTQ rights movement. In the United States, the earliest homophile organizations were all founded in California: the Mattachine Society, ONE Incorporated, and the Daughters of Bilitis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract: This paper consists of three complementary parts. The first section describes three instances where very technical scholarship on Greek literature overlaps with, and draws attention to, particularly dramatic historical contexts. This section describes an aspect of Greco-Roman studies that is both too demanding and too narrow — too demanding because it assumes that anglophone researchers work with scholarship in languages such as French, German, and Italian, but too narrow because it does not engage with scholarship that is not in a major European language. The second section talks about the general need for Classics and Classical Studies in a country such as the United States to extend beyond Greece and Rome. This section builds on work that I have published in the past distinguishing Greco-Roman from Classical Studies. The third section describes a more concerted attempt to expand beyond North Africa and to include sources from Sub-Saharan Africa. I report on developing for a spring 2021 course on Epic Poetry a 10,000-line Mandinka/English corpus of stories produced by West African Griots. I will also briefly discuss the use of Classical Arabic to explore locally produced sources about West African history and culture. As a first step, the fall 2021 course on Classical historians at Tufts University will center not only on sources such as Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy and Tacitus but on two histories that focus on the Songhay Empire: the Tarikh al-Fattâsh, begun c. 1593 by Mahmud Kati, and the Tarikh as-Sudân, composed by al-Sadi (c. 1594–1655). This class will expand the role of Classical Arabic in Classical Studies at Tufts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This year, eight HBCUs were awarded more than $650,000 in funding to develop cultural heritage stewardship plans for their campuses and historic sites. The sole goal of this initiative is to partner with HBCUs to empower and preserve the legacies of the campuses and ensure that the stories of their foundations are upheld to educate and inspire future generations of students to pay it forward. As part of this work, we conducted a Q&amp;amp;A with each grant recipient to learn about the history and work at each of these significant institutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This year, eight HBCUs were awarded more than $650,000 in funding to develop cultural heritage stewardship plans for their campuses and historic sites. The sole goal of this initiative is to partner with HBCUs to empower and preserve the legacies of the campuses and ensure that the stories of their foundations are upheld to educate and inspire future generations of students to pay it forward. As part of this work, we conducted a Q&amp;amp;A with each grant recipient to learn about the history and work at each of these significant institutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the last several months, Rebecca Romanchuk (TARO's Immediate Past Chair) led a group of archivists from the TARO Steering Committee, various TARO subcommittees, and members of UT Libraries through a maze of almost a dozen concepts and color palettes. Ideas varied wildly, ranging from off-beat, mid-century-modern circles and diamonds framing the TARO acronym to a magnifying glass replacing the ‘O' in TARO. But at last, the group's hard work paid off. Without further ado, here it is!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The previous models developed for the Women Writers Vector Toolkit (WWVT) allow users only to interact with a corpora using single word queries. While useful, this approach does have limitations: for instance, in querying multi-word terms such as place names ("New York") or concepts ("women's rights"). When a word embedding model is made using the wordVectors package, a textual corpus is tokenized into individual word-level units. Therefore, when the word embedding model is created, it forms a relational model between the words of a corpus, not phrases or concepts. After the first Word Vectors for the Thoughtful Humanist institute in 2019, the WWVT team sought to create expanded resources for scholars interested in word embedding models. One part of this project was to create a workflow that could provide opportunities to tokenize multiword strings in the word embedding models.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The fall of 2016 was an interesting time to publish a book on the relationship between religion, identity, and politics. As we know, the United States elected a president in November who ran on an openly Islamophobic platform and who, within the first weeks of his administration, has made dramatic changes to American immigration policy.  Trump's election is part of a general 21st-century wave of resurgent nationalism, populism, militarism, and religious and ideological conflict that are responses to broader social and economic change. My book, Polemics and Patronage in the City of Victory, looks at a time and place quite removed from our contemporary lives: the South Indian empire of Vijayanagara in the early 1500s. But, not unlike recent reality, this empire was marked by high levels of immigration, foreign trade, a rapidly changing economy, and new patterns of religious, ethnic, and linguistic diversity. Much as in today's world, these changes generated both anxiety and opportunity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>History reminds us that things don't always get endlessly better. As a colleague of mine says, "It's always fun until the historians show up." When you hear people start sentences with phrases like, "For the first time in history …" or "Never before has …" — that's when historians push the pause button. We bust myths. We pop balloons. We're annoying, but humility is a virtue that history can teach.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Following Heather L. Hodges's fantastic guest post about the Gullah Geechee culture that the Gershwins and Heywards portray in Porgy and Bess, we turn to one of the opera's most contended aspects: its treatment of the Gullah language. In this post, our managing editor, Andrew S. Kohler, explores how the work's text came to be so far removed from Gullah, and how future performances may approach the inconsistent libretto so as to give Gullah culture and language the respect they are due.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To kick off our new series, The Past and Present of Porgy and Bess, we're pleased to welcome guest contributor and expert on Gullah Geechee culture, Heather L. Hodges. In this post, Heather tells the deeply researched story of a staged Gullah Geechee musical performance that George Gershwin heard during his 1934 trip to South Carolina. She explains that understanding Gullah Geechee musical traditions and learning about the people who have kept them alive is critical to how audiences, producers, and performers approach Porgy and Bess today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite being among the most prominent operas of the twentieth century, and perhaps the Gershwin brothers' most monumental achievement, Porgy and Bess occupies an uneasy place in US musical history. In this series, Managing Editor Andrew S. Kohler, Ph.D. and blog team leader Kai West explore the opera's complex and at times problematic representations of race, gender, disability, and class, connecting Porgy and Bess to today's conversations about social justice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>George Gershwin's work creating rolls for player piano remains a source of curiosity among scholars and enthusiasts alike. But the more we search for evidence of Gershwin's individuality and style in this lost technology, the more questions arise about the role of the composer as a visible author of music within the culture of 1910–20s music consumption, and whether during his lifetime these musical artifacts were even perceived as "recordings" at all.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Eva Jessye had a special relationship to the University of Michigan and to the city of Ann Arbor. Join blog team member Sophia Janevic as she spends a day in Jessye's archive, currently housed at the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library, and speculates on what its materials can tell us about Dr. Jessye's vibrant life. This is the final installment of a 3-part series on Dr. Eva Jessye. In part 1, we explored Jessye's early life and her achievements as a choral director and composer, while part 2 chronicled Jessye's work as the longtime choral director of The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While it was never particularly successful, George Gershwin's 1922 one-act "jazz-opera" Blue Monday played an important role in bridging the gap between his popular style and classical compositions. This post—the final installment of our three-part series devoted to Blue Monday—explores just what a "jazz-opera" might be and delves deeper into the cultural implications of these stylistic elements in Gershwin's work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Black music is a house of many mansions. Blacks have many musics and some of them relate in an extremely universal way to the human condition," said Undine Smith Moore, who believed strongly in the power of Black music to reveal the innermost parts of the human heart, mind, body, and soul. This post is a celebration of her life as a Black woman in America, a legacy of bravery and persistence that lives on through her music.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Across the South, as the tide of emancipation rose, African Americans were finding that the authority of slave owners was being replaced by the authority of the United States government — military officers, politicians, agents of the Freedmen's Bureau. White northerners did not always have freed people's best interests at heart, to be sure, but they were at least supposed to take those interests seriously. So, from the pens of former slaves, whom many white people had presumed were illiterate, came reams of written grievances.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Armchair travel is more popular than ever today, making this an excellent time to explore a key moment in the history of home-bound travel. In the Victorian era, people used a stereoscope to launch themselves on virtual journeys to far-off lands from their own parlors. Users inserted a stereograph, twinned photos of a slightly discrepant image, into the device and then peeped into the eyepiece, where the image leaped into startling three dimensionality. The stereoscope created an immersive you-are-there illusion, a feeling that was pleasurable and even dizzying.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Maps are excellent documentary sources for understanding the history of the landscape, including past human activities and former physical environments. Many organizations have scanned tens of thousands of historical maps and shared them online. For example, the Sanborn Fire Insurance Map Collection scanned by the Library of Congress shows detailed changes in the built environment of North American cities during the 19th and early 20th centuries. USGS topographic maps illustrate the past landscape of the whole of the United States during the 19th century. Meanwhile, on this side of the pond, the Ordnance Survey's large-scale maps, many of which have been digitised by the National Library of Scotland, cover Great Britain from the 19th century to the present day, and provide a wealth of information for researching urban and rural built and natural environments as they change over time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On the eve of Inauguration Day, 2021, it is worthwhile exploring two letters from April 1789 in the Liberty Hall Collection in the Kean University Special Collections Research Library and Archives. Both letters contain details about the excitement in New York in anticipation of the inauguration of George Washington and the ceremonies of that momentous event. As the country again prepares to watch and listen as the President takes the oath of office, some of those ceremonies will sound familiar, but his year they will occur in an atmosphere unlike any other in the nation's history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The New York Weekly, like all dime novels and story papers, was mass-produced and printed on thin paper, meaning that the issues had degraded and were fragile, and required conservation treatment and additional preparation and handling for digitization. Adding to the complexity was the size of The New York Weekly, measuring 42" x 28" when unfolded. In consultation with the Conservation department, the Digital Production Group determined the safest and most efficient method of digitizing the issues, while minimizing the handling and movement of the material. In the following blog post, Chris Hacker, Astrid Smith, and Sarah Newton will describe the conservation assessment, repairs, and digitization workflow for these rare and fragile Dime Novels.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection, Ecologies of War, extends ethnographic attention beyond "war itself" to include forms of war that are often unrecognized as such—in everyday experiences, material effects, and affective resonances of violence that have penetrated and contaminated the environments and ecologies of places where perpetual wars of US empire, never-ending wars, and peacelessness of political enmity continue. Although environmental historians have examined battlegrounds and landscapes altered by military activities and technologies, these essays bring an explicitly anthropological approach to essential entanglements of wars and ecologies, characterized by proliferations and archives of violence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>You decide to tackle that long-postponed task—going through the boxes of material moved from your grandparents' home into your basement.  When you unpack them, you find a box within a box. It might contain some black and white photographs: someone in a nurse's uniform, someone carrying a flag. It might hold a set of medals, an old cap, a pair of worn-in boots, or a government-issued recipe booklet on how forgoing sugar will help win the war, with handwritten annotations next to the family favorites. When looking through these items, you might remember as a child playing with the medals or watching a face light up when looking at a photograph. While many of us have no direct experience with military combat, we often live with the souvenirs, objects, and other remnants passed down from those who did. Sometimes, the objects collected or saved by our relatives, friends, and neighbors who have participated in the last century's wars linger on as memorials. These tell us much about how members of our families and communities contributed to wartime activities, overseas and at home. But sometimes, unless we take a moment to ask about the meaning of the stuff in those boxes, we lose their significance and thus a way to understand our shared past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We recently introduced our project Maintenance Culture: Sustaining Digital Creative Works. Throughout this project we'll be working on building communities in six areas: Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Seattle, and the Midwest (city TBD). If you're not near any of these, don't worry, all of our resources will also be online, and we'll be developing a skillshare hosting toolkit that you could use to host one in your area. The blog post details what's next for building communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Collaboration is a huge part of the Maintenance Culture project ethos, and our first big collaborative gathering is coming up on August 1 - 2. Myriad is gathering 24 incredible Maintenance Culture stakeholders / preservation and digital art powerhouses to start designing guidelines, workshop materials, tools, and resources to support institutions preserving born-digital, creative works. We're calling the gathering a Charrette, which is a term we're borrowing from other disciplines - it's often used in urban planning. The blog post provides more details about what a Charrette is and how Myriad ran the event in August 2022.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On August 1 - 2, 2022 Myriad convened a gathering of video artists, digital creators, designers, archivists, librarians, and museum professionals to talk about preserving complex, born-digital, creative works at a design charrette (read more about what a charrette is in another blog post). The whole group was incredibly engaged, enthusiastic, and generous with their knowledge and time.   The results of this gathering will lead to guidelines for preserving complex, born-digital, creative works; workshops and skillshares across the US; and tools and resources to support institutions and creators.   The blog presents some findings from conversations across creators and maintainers at the Charrette.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Living with the Urban Ocean" NEH-funded project demonstrates how the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) can infuse enthusiasm for the Boston Harbor and its 34 islands with the campus' students of color (who constitute a majority) so that they can be inspired to be the harbor's and islands' climate stewards of the future. The project also brings together the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences in a vibrant collaborative curricular development and pedagogical endeavor. Furthermore, the project's partnership with the National Park Service shows how government agencies and universities can strengthen urban communities' capacities for climate stewardship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nicaragua was ruled for forty-three years by the Somoza family as a dictatorship before the rulers were overthrown by the Nicaraguan people. On July 19, 1979, a new government was established that focused on land reform, redistributing 5.7 million acres taken from the dictator Somoza and his associates to small and medium-sized farmers to create private farms, cooperatives and government-owned farms. The new Nicaraguan government realized the importance of creating partnerships with North American farmers. Their impoverished country needed investment, technical expertise and skilled farmers. Partnerships formed between the two regions to provide literacy programs, agricultural development training and educational tours in both Nicaragua and the United States.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1966 in Sumter County, Alabama, forty black families of former sharecroppers formed the Panola Land Buying Association (PLBA). The families formed the association following their evictions resulting from a dispute involving the correct share of deferred acreage payments from the Department of Agriculture. No longer able to live on the land which they had worked, the group chartered the PLBA in 1967 and, with the aid of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives (FSC), was able to redeem a 1,164-acre parcel of land in a foreclosure sale. The land was located in Epes, in Sumter County, Alabama, and was used to build homes for PLBA members and to house the FSC's Rural Training and Research Center.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On the occasion of the Shelburne Museum's 75th anniversary, the museum will reopen its historic Stagecoach Inn building, home to the museum's renowned American folk art collection, on September 11.  After a two-year renovation, Stagecoach Inn's galleries have been refreshed and reinstalled with iconic selections representing the best of the museum's folk art collection. New research looks past the formal qualities of weathervanes, ship's carvings, trade signs, and more, digging into the origins, makers, and functions of these objects to offer 21st-century perspectives reflective of the vast and varied ingenuity and creativity that inflects America's rich visual story.  "Renovating Stagecoach Inn created the opportunity to rethink how the American folk art collection is presented," said Thomas Denenberg, John Wilmerding Director and CEO at Shelburne Museum. "The new installation aims to deepen visitors' understanding of the ‘invention' of folk art in the context of the times in which the very category was created and elucidate narratives that are relevant today."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Starting in the year 1870, a new type of public recreation space referred to as the "people's garden" (millet bahçesi) or municipal garden (belediye bahçesi) took root in the Ottoman Empire's cities and towns. There is a direct connection between the spread of the new public gardens and the expansion of modern infrastructure. Transportation linked communities more closely, but the new public gardens also became symbols of how urban or provincial public reform could benefit the local populace in the creation of public or semi-public space.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When we started Maintenance Culture we wanted a quickly recognizable visual identity for the project - something that communicates qualities of the work, catches the eye, and unifies materials that we create through the project. Abby Doyle worked with us to make our Maintenance Culture branding dreams come true.   Abby is the designer and owner behind ADoyle Designs. She brainstormed with us by taking from abstract concepts like sustainability, digital preservation, and creative works, and used them to develop the amazing logo, colors, and name for Maintenance Culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Myriad gathered a group of creators and maintainers of born-digital, creative works to start defining guidelines and building a curriculum for sustaining access to complex digital creative works. We called the gathering a Charrette, which you can read more about in an earlier blog post, and you can read Part 1 of the recap on our blog too.   Many people we gathered at the Charrette had never met before, and never collaborated before! We brought together 20 people, with 20 individual perspectives, experiences, and relationships with born-digital, creative works. To build some cohesion across the group, set a base for decision-making, and guide our work throughout the Charrette, we facilitated an exercise to identify shared values.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This year has been a momentous one, especially due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and all the ways we have had to adapt to public health safety precautions while continuing the important work we do at our institutions to the greatest extent possible. Despite these trying circumstances, archives professionals have risen to the challenge and optimized productivity through new ways of working remotely and forging online connections that are anything but "virtual," with fellow staff, volunteers, and our audiences. TARO is no different—our Steering Committee and subcommittees have moved to holding Zoom meetings this year rather than conference phone calls, and we believe these face-to-face interactions (even though through a screen) are building stronger collegial relationships that benefit TARO as well as reinforcing the many connections among our member repositories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What an amazing year 2021 was for TARO. Never before have so many of our repositories, volunteers, and others from around the state come together to do so much for this consortium. From the massive data remediation efforts early in the year, to the diligent testing of the constantly evolving txarchives.org (or "TARO 2.0") website, we somehow accomplished everything we had hoped. And we did it all despite continuing to negotiate COVID, winter storms, and other challenges. We on the TARO Steering Committee cannot thank every single one of you enough for all your hard work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The WVU News Blog published a blog on our German newspapers written by student grant assistant, John Weaver, published on April 11, 2022:   Abstract: "The Deutsche Zeitung (literally German Newspaper) was a German language newspaper from Wheeling publishing under that name beginning in 1901. It was not the first German newspaper in the state. German language journalism in western Virginia precedes the Civil War with the Virginische Staats-Zeitung, (Virginia State Newspaper) 1848 – 1863, which became the West Virginische Staats-Zeitung following West Virginia statehood in 1863. Other German newspapers, namely Der Arbeiter-Freund (the Worker's Friend), also had its start during the Civil War era."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the last year, the Mapping Prejudice team has focused on explaining why its institutional home in an academic research library can serve as a model for other libraries, institutions of higher education, and social justice initiatives. We have explored this topic in a blog post for the Brookings Institute as well as a scholarly journal article intended to reach librarians. As our Brookings piece explained, "A library makes perfect sense for a justice-oriented public history project like this because of its values and aspirations, even if the gap between these and reality can be significant and problematic. Libraries are committed to openness and collaboration, while public historians are driven to listen and co-create with the community."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This three-part series proposes that digital public history can deepen our study of the American folk music revival and cultural history in the United States. Conversely, it also contends that the folk music revival—with its hootenanny sing-alongs and sense of collective action—offers intriguing democratic models for digital public history. Part one explains how my research on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival Project got started as a digital public history endeavor when I discovered a little-used archive of over 30,000 artifacts at Northwestern University's Special Collections Library. Part two presents the shared effort among librarians, archivists, students, and participants to curate the material digitally. Part three provides a preview of where the Berkeley Folk Music will go next.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This blog explores the life of the enslaved Sidi Asim/Paulo, an African-origin Gujarati merchant who was enslaved off the Swahili coast and sold to a fisherman in Portuguese Goa before escaping, only to be recaptured by the inquisition upon his return to Goa as part of the Mughal ambassador's entourage. Using his life, I argue for the need to attend to a history of subaltern mobility. The legacies of runaway slaves like Sidi Asim/Paulo is apparent across the landscape of the Konkan coast: shrines dedicated to deities called khaprideva attract worshippers along the coast of Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka, while kappiri mutappan in Kochi is a legacy of the city's past as an emporium for African slaves. In these shrines, runaway slaves of African descent are commemorated obliquely, even when popular memory and mainstream historiography are largely blind to their presence in the past. It is landscapes like this, defined by histories of subaltern mobility, that requires historicization. These voyages, often undertaken out of fear and predicated on violence, are a testament to the creative spatial practices of historical actors attempting to escape the strictures that confined them. Following the pathways of these travellers allows us to see the porosity and fragility of political boundaries asserted by elites and to free our geographical imaginations which are too often beholden to such fictions of power.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>West Virginia educator Adena Barnette takes a deep dive into the history surrounding John Ross' "Address to the People of the United States by the General Council of the Cherokee Nation," Document 13 in 50 Core American Documents. "One of the highlights of a history teacher's summer vacation is attending high-quality professional development that allows a teacher to deep dive into subjects of interest.  This summer, I traveled to Reinhardt University in Waleska, Georgia for an NEH Landmarks of American History Workshop entitled "Trail of Tears Context and Perspectives."  Throughout the week, our group visited ancestral Cherokee sites such as the Chieftains Museum/Major Ridge Home and the New Echota State Historic Site.  This week long study with anthropologists, historians, and Cherokee elders emphasized the key ideas in Cherokee Principal Chief John Ross's 1830 "Address to the People of the United States by the General Council of the Cherokee Nation" from the 50 Core American Documents published by Teaching American History (TAH) at Ashland University.</Abstract>

Either the plan or essay will have a summary of what each Summer Scholar learned about a concept presented and that is most applicable in his or her individual secondary classroom, grades 6–12.  All Summer Scholars were strongly encouraged to be creative, original, and responsible with their E-Portfolio Project.  The E-Portfolio was completed as part of a stipend payment from the NEH grant.  You may preview the 2017 and 2019 E-Portfolios at our website.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Are the roots of Black American English mainly African? Or English? Or are they found in Caribbean-based creole languages? Over time, each of these theories has risen briefly to prominence. Most linguists believe there is just not enough conclusive evidence for any single theory.

		<Abstract>Most people have never heard of Udi, one of more than 50 languages spoken in the Caucasus. But when it comes to endangered languages, it is something of a poster child. The history of the Udi people and their language includes an ancient kingdom, an exodus to escape persecution, the creation of a bespoke alphabet and a unique grammar.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1720 to 1722, the French region of Provence and surrounding areas experienced one of the last major epidemics of plague to strike Western Europe. The Plague of Provence was a major disaster that left in its wake as many as 126,000 deaths, as well as new understandings about the nature of contagion and the best ways to manage its threat. In this transnational study, Cindy Ermus focuses on the social, commercial, and diplomatic impact of the epidemic beyond French borders, examining reactions to this public health crisis from Italy to Great Britain to Spain and the overseas colonies. She reveals how a crisis in one part of the globe can transcend geographic boundaries and influence society, politics, and public health policy in regions far from the epicentre of disaster.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Funchal, April 1922—arriving via steamship from New York City that month, Elias Mallouk was met at the port by a heckling crowd, an ominous start to a difficult year. As Madeira's most prominent exporter of hand embroideries, Mallouk represented the industry in Funchal and abroad. He came to the island with a specific mission: to restructure the industry to favor American exporters, overwhelmingly Syrian immigrants from New York. Mallouk met with the U.S. Consul General, Eells Stillman, before proceeding to the Madeira Embroidery Club, a manufacturers' association that governed the wages for embroidery workers. Assembling that April, the body ordered an unpopular thirty percent wage reduction, drawing threats of a general strike by the Madeiran women who sewed Mallouk goods in their homes across the island.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the long U.S. literary history of imagining coral and labor, reefs both illuminate and dangerously elide the exploitation of laboring bodies by imagining that they had a choice and a reward. If we wish to assess the stakes of our present-day desire to imagine ourselves and society as a reef, then we should turn back to a time when coral and its nature were a more regular part of life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We are pleased to discuss with Professor Seiji Shirane the intermediary role of colonial Taiwan and overseas Taiwanese subjects in the Japanese Empire's southern advance in South China and Southeast Asia.   Professor Shirane is a historian of modern Japan at The City College of New York (CUNY). His first book is Imperial Gateway: Colonial Taiwan and Japan's Expansion in South China and Southeast Asia, 1895–1945 (Cornell University Press, 2022). His research has received support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Fulbright, Social Science Research Council, and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.  The interview was conducted online in English on February 2, 2023 and has been edited for clarity. The interview is published in two parts. Part 1 details Professor Shirane's academic trajectory and the historiographical interventions that his scholarship builds on and further extends. Part 2 covers Professor Shirane's thoughts on his book's potential reception in Taiwan, his pedagogical and historiographical interventions in the field of modern Japanese history, the goals of the newly founded Modern Japan History Association (MJHA), and his advice to graduate students studying Taiwan history in North America.   Interviewed and edited by Sabrina Teng-io Chung</Abstract>

With these ideas in mind, we'll talk about why libraries are such an important community resource for cultural programming in their communities, an idea that ALA recently shared at the National Humanities Conference (NHC2022).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As 2020 begins to wind down, we can reflect on all that we've learned about virtual programming. Many of us entered the year as novices, but we're leaving it with some serious skills — whether from wrangling a boisterous virtual book club or shifting a cultural heritage festival from stage to screen. But have you mastered the art of marketing your virtual programs? Or are you still struggling to get people to log in? We reached out to 10 librarians who specialize in program marketing and asked what they're doing to increase attendance at their virtual humanities programs. Here's what they said.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>If you've hosted an author talk or moderated a panel discussion in person, rest assured: online, the drill is pretty similar.  "Nothing is more important than preparation," says Donna Seaman, Booklist's Adult Books Editor and an award-winning literary critic who has interviewed hundreds of authors throughout her career. "The more fluent you are in the writer's work, the better the conversation."  Still, Seaman cautions, you may need to make a few adjustments in a virtual setting. Here are her tips.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This boat made its final journey in Spring 2018. The boat has no name or indication of country of origin, but Tunisian water bottles tucked under the hull on the landward side give us a clue. This plexiglass boat bears no resemblance to the small wooden fishing boats used by locals, thus we suspect that it served to transport undocumented migrants across the Sicilian Channel from Tunisia to Sicily. The boat is smaller than those unseaworthy wrecks shown in the news, highlighting the differences in the forms that forced migration can take, even in the same part of the world. Clothing and personal items from landing sites nearby allow us to infer that this boat would have been used by a small group, probably young men, probably Tunisian nationals, who by making the crossing were repeating a behavior with a deep, millennia-long history.  After getting off the boat the travelers on that last voyage would have, if lucky, dispersed into the Sicilian countryside either on foot or by car. The boat therefore represents the maritime portion of a longer journey, perhaps one it made many times before being abandoned. From its burnt out state and missing engine, it has undergone changes since landing on this quiet shore in western Sicily. Who destroyed it, the travelers or locals? We cannot know. This boat nonetheless tells of small-scale voyages in both directions that together form an enduring shared history that national borders cannot suppress.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The purpose of this essay is to underscore how the CAORC-NEH Senior Fellowship to Senegal opened up numerous doors for me - both figuratively and literally - as both a scholar and field researcher, many of them unanticipated. Thanks to support from CAORC, in 2018 I was able to conduct four months of intensive fieldwork among communities in Casamance researching Senegal's Joola shipwreck, in which 1,863 people died aboard a passenger ferry bound for Dakar when it sailed into a storm. I'm especially proud that my book, "Africa's Joola Shipwreck: Causes and Consequences of a Humanitarian Disaster" was released in 2021, an accomplishment that would not have been possible without the support of CAORC - NEH.  This Fall, the National Association of the Families of the Victims of the Joola (ANFV) awarded me the Knight of the Order of the Joola for my bringing Senegal's story to an American audience, their highest honor. While I am grateful for this important accolade, I also believe there remains significant work ahead as we launch a second, collaborative book highlighting the 20th anniversary of the wreck, post-disaster recovery, and community resilience. We will return to Casamance, Senegal in 2022 to work on this project, while also commencing a new study featuring the cultural values of baobab</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I began the project out of which my JWH article "An Operation More Appropriate for Women": The Gendering of Smallpox Vaccination in the Spanish Empire" grew before COVID-19 even existed, thinking that the extension of the smallpox vaccine with its global reach would provide insights into race and gender tensions in the waning years of the Spanish Empire. While that is still the focus of my research, with the advent of the pandemic and the subsequent roll out of public health measures, including vaccines, to counter the virus, I have found myself increasingly engaged with the current debates over those measures. Although I am always attentive to the differences between the world that I study and the world in which I live, the reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine have given me useful insight into  how public health measures have dredged up many of the same concerns over women's bodies and government intervention that hindered the extension of first inoculation and then vaccination against smallpox more than two hundred years ago.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When considering how to accurately structure the dataset of klezmer music, we must answer a surprisingly complex question: how do we define a tune? And how do we best capture our diverse and often conflicting understandings of tunes into a clean, consistent data model?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Before I transitioned into a career in the field of library and archives, I served seven years on active duty in the US Air Force as an Arabic Cryptologic Language Analyst. Therefore, as a veteran—and because November is both the month in which we celebrate Veterans Day (November 11) and National Native American Heritage Month—I thought it fitting to focus this essay on Native American artists whose art careers have in some way been influenced by military service. My intention here is not to present a chronological account of the role Native Americans have played in the history of the US armed forces. For those who are interested in learning more about this history, Watson Library has recently acquired a copy of Why We Serve: Native Americans in the United States Armed Forces, a catalog which accompanied an exhibition of the same title that took place at the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) from November 11, 2020 to February 28, 2021.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In October 2021, Watson Library was awarded a grant as part of the National Endowment for the Humanities American Rescue Plan: Humanities Organizations program to fund a yearlong project to assess, expand, and promote access to the library's collection of publications by and about Indigenous American, Hispanic American/Latinx, and Asian American and Pacific Islander artists. Building upon experience gained from the African American Artist Project (AAAP), an eight-member project team—comprising three library associates, three research associate/bibliographers, and two cataloging and metadata associate librarians—was hired. Each team member works a part-time schedule of twenty hours per week and reports to Jared Ash, project director for the grant.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since November 2021, Watson Library has conducted a project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities titled "Research and Outreach: Increasing Representation of Indigenous American, Hispanic American, Asian American and Pacific Islander artists in The Met's Thomas J. Watson Library." The project, detailed in an earlier blog post by my colleague Helice Koffler, has enabled us to assess the existing collection of books in Watson with the goal of adding relevant monographs, exhibition catalogues, journals, zines, and artists' books. I'd like to introduce a few of these recently added titles here to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the last ten months working as a Research Associate and Bibliographer for the NEH collection expansion grant project, I have researched over one thousand artists and helped Watson Library identify and acquire over seven hundred titles by or about Latinx and Hispanic American artists. As a transplant who moved to New York City to study early modern Spanish art, I was ignorant of the rich history of contemporary Latin American artists who have made New York their home. As we have researched, purchased, unboxed, and cataloged new titles for Watson Library, I have learned more about how much this thriving artistic community has championed the preservation and enrichment of the many cultural heritages that make up the broader Latinx and Hispanic American population of this city. And how, in their organizing and publications, they have altered the course of contemporary art in the United States.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From the Collections is a recurring feature at aihp.org that highlights articles, artifacts, images, and other items of interest from AIHP publications and collections. This post is contributed by Susie Seefelt Lesieutre, AIHP's Collections Associate.  As work begins on the National Endowment for the Humanities grant awarded earlier this year, the historical collections in the AIHP Kremers Reference Files continue to support and inform other critical projects as well, such as student-led inquiry and research. One such project is being conducted by JJ Strange, a PhD student in the University of Wisconsin-Madison History of Science, Medicine and Technology program. Strange is studying the work of Chinese students that attended the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy in the early 20th century.</Abstract>
