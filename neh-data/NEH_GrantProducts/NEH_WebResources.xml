		<Abstract>With generous funding from NEH in 2009, the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities was able to create content related to the topics of Virginia's Precolonial and Colonial history and culture. Assets created, edited, and aggregated include digitally born entries reflecting contemporary scholarship related to the content focus, unique digital assets (e.g. portraits, manuscripts, and audio/video material) from partnership organizations, and transcribed primary documents to add layers of depth and context to the topical entries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Women's World in Qajar Iran (WWQI) is a comprehensive digital archive and website that preserves, links, and renders accessible primary source materials related to the social and cultural history of women's worlds during the reign of the Qajar dynasty (1796 – 1925) in Iran. The WWQI project addresses a significant gap in the scholarship related to this important time in Iran's history by making available writings and other personal documents created by, and related to the lives of, women during the Qajar era. Primary source materials -- digitized and rendered accessible to scholars worldwide via a digital archive, www.qajarwomen.org -- include unpublished poetry, essays, and treatises; travelogues; private letters; marriage contracts; photographs and portrait paintings; calligraphies; and legal documents.  A number of collections, comprised of similar materials at museums and archives in Iran, have also been added through collaboration with local institutions.   </Abstract>

		<Abstract>EMLoT lets you see what direct use has been made, over the last four centuries, of pre-1642 documents related to professional performance in purpose-built theatres and other permanent structures in the London area. It is not a comprehensive collection of those pre-1642 documents; rather, it charts the copies (or ‘transcriptions') which were subsequently made of them. It thus gives you access to the varied and long ‘after-life' of those documents. It tells you who used them, and when, and where you can find evidence of that use. It also gives you some access to what was used, because it includes a brief account (or ‘abstract') of the transcription's contents, together with a reference to the location of the original document.  (Note: EmLoT is not directly funded by NEH, but is closely associated with the work of the REED project.)</Abstract>

Scholl Center for American History and Culture hosted a Landmarks of American History and Culture Workshop for community college faculty on the company town of Pullman. This workshop provided community college teachers with a week of challenging intellectual engagement and reflection about their research and teaching on labor, race, and urban landscape—concepts central to the nation's historical narrative. Participants spent three days at the Newberry and two days on site visits to the Pullman Historic District and other Chicago locations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This one year project sought to close the gap between the lack of supporting infrastructure available to humanities scholars and the desire of researchers to access and study resources digitized and/or published to the Web. The project sought to establish a possible framework for e-Humanities research using available open source tools and technologies and archived web content. Sample collections of materials relating to World Wars I &amp;amp; II were compiled to help illustrate researcher needs and requirements and in anticipation of further development of tools for working with very large volumes of data housed by digital archives around the globe.  The WWWoH project was a collaboration between Internet Archive(IA), The Oxford Internet Insitute (OII), and Hanzo Archives. OII and the Australian National University contributed expertise in web research and led the curation of these collections for application and use by humanities scholars. Both IA and Hanzo Archives a[pplied extensive experience in web archiving and in the creation of web collections to extract, assemble, and make accessible, archival data germane to this project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Waters of Rome is a refereed, on-line journal of occasional papers concerned with water studies and the city of Rome. Authors submit articles on any aspect of the hydrological or hydraulic history of Rome from the prehistoric to the present day, to be considered for publication. Articles that investigate water and water infrastructure as a system (rather than examining an individual feature) within a social, cultural, or technological context are particularly welcome. The online journal seeks to stimulate discussion about water's role in urban development, especially within the context of issues of infrastructural and landscape urbanism studies. Every submission is reviewed by the editor and a minimum of two outside reviewers who are authorities drawn from the disciplines of history, classics, architecture, landscape architecture, archaeology, architectural and art history, and geography. Authors are responsible for securing any necessary permissions. Authors retain the copyright for any work published at Aquae Urbis Romae: the Waters of the City of Rome.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The William F. Cody Archive provides an invaluable record of the late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century American national development. Through this digital archive and its associated texts, researchers and visitors have an unequaled opportunity to see, through the eyes of Buffalo Bill, the expansion and growth of the American West. Readers are given glimpses of attitudes of the time through his interactions with individuals ranging from statesmen and royalty to noted military and literary figures who sought his opinion on policy questions concerning the American West. A greater understanding of public attitudes and political, economic, and environmental policies that affected the United States during his lifetime are also reflected in his lesser-known roles as a community founder, businessman, rancher, and investor.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The remains of what once had been the provincial capital of the second Upper Egyptian administrative district can be found at Tell Edfu. Located between Luxor and Aswan, it is one of the best-preserved ancient towns in Egypt, and one of the rare examples where almost three thousand years of ancient Egyptian history are still preserved in the stratigraphy of a single site. Tell Edfu therefore provides enormous potential for increasing our understanding of ancient urbanism in Egypt, a topic that is still poorly understood since it relies almost entirely on archaeological data. The excavations at Tell Edfu provide an abundance of completely new data, thus shedding a fresh light on the development and character of a naturally grown urban center and the relation to its surroundings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In August 2010, the Newberry Library in Chicago hosted a regional Picturing America School Collaboration Projects Conference for high school teachers. This regional conference followed the two national conferences hosted by the Newberry in 2009-10. The conference sessions explored the role of landscape imagery in shaping national identity, tracing the shift from a nineteenth-century emphasis on visions of pristine wilderness and rural landscapes to the twentieth-century's urban and industrial scenery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Focusing on a neglected but important repertory of polyphonic songs from mid-sixteenth-century France, this unique project puts old books before a diverse audience of modern scholars and musicians in ways that will prompt renewed understanding of these cultural artifacts and their meanings. It is dedicated to sixteen sets of books expertly crafted by the Parisian printer Nicholas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568. In them, we can trace changing literary tastes, musical fashions, and above all the impact of the relatively new medium of printing on musical culture of the day.  Here readers will find facsimiles of all sixteen sets of books, plus modern transcriptions, scholarly commentaries, and tools for research. There are also links to related projects sponsored by the CESR, including a broader database of the sixteenth-century chanson repertory, a project devoted to the reconstruction of pieces with missing voice parts, and another devoted to the study and editing of the literary texts of the chansons themselves. All of this has been assembled under a number of headings designed to encourage researchers, students, and performers to explore the rich world of the chanson at mid century. We invite readers to make productive use of these resources, and to tell us about what you have learned from them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With approximately 40,000 menus dating from the 1840s to the present, The New York Public Library's restaurant menu collection is one of the largest in the world, used by historians, chefs, novelists and everyday food enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the menus are very difficult to search for the greatest treasures they contain: specific information about dishes, prices, the organization of meals, and all the stories these things tell us about the history of food and culture. To solve this, the Library is working to improve the collection by transcribing the menus, dish by dish. The website of the NEH funded project, Crowdsourcing Culinary History at The New York Public Library, is called "What's on the Menu" and invites the public to help the Library transcribe the menus. The project will allow the Library to dramatically expand the ways in which the collection can be researched and accessed, opening the door to new kinds of discoveries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Le Dictionnaire vivant de la langue française (DVLF) represents a new way of looking at French dictionaries.  While we include results from a number of traditional dictionary resources, we've also created a way for you to add your own definitions or word senses to the information we display.  We can also show you dozens of example sentences for the words you look up so that you can see how the words you're curious about have changed over the centuries.  Additionally, you can rate and critique our example sentences, which allows the DVLF to automatically feature the best and most useful information we have.  The DVLF is here to give you a better dictionary, one that reflects the way YOU use language.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1401 a young man named Michael of Rhodes joined the Venetian navy as a lowly galley oarsman. Over the next four decades, he sailed on more than 40 voyages and took part in five major sea battles, rising through the ranks to become a trusted galley commander. Michael documented his life and knowledge in a remarkable manuscript. Only recently rediscovered, it chronicles Michael's service record and includes more than 200 pages of commercial and calendrical computations, a beautifully illustrated section on astrology, some of the earliest surviving portolan aids to navigation, and the world's first known treatise on shipbuilding. The interactive website allows users to explore Michael's world.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>From the 1770s onwards Britain experienced an economic growth pattern that was distinctive in world history. The economy did not boom or bust, innovation did not happen and remain dormant, but rather both steadily and continuously grew. What we see in the eighteenth century is the emergence of what Joel Mokyr calls the first "enlightened economy." Progress rested on knowledge and it too expanded throughout the century and into the next. This site, made possible, in part, by NEH funding, aims to document the contours of this new knowledge economy by providing manuscripts and printed books from the period that can searched for research into transformations in textile production, coal mining, and steam engines in the mechanization of industry.</PrimaryURLDescription>

The goal of the exhibit is to educate the public about the fragility of our nation's cultural heritage and how libraries and library conservators are saving the books from our past.

		<Abstract>This project grew out of a desire to attain a deeper understanding of the complex multicultural phenomenon that is Latin music. Born in West and Central Africa, raised in Haiti, Cuba, Brazil and New Orleans, and attaining its full bloom in New York, Latin music is truly a global phenomenon that embraces two centuries, three continents and innumerable cultural traditions.  Today, salsa and Latin jazz are played and enjoyed all over the world by musicians and dancers of all ethnic origins. Until recently, full-length studies on this subject were scarce. In the past ten years, research on the origins and development of jazz yielded information and renewed interest on the parallel, intertwined development of its close cousin, Latin music.  Since 1999, seminal studies have been published by John Storm Roberts, Robin Moore, Isabelle Leymarie, Lise Waxer, Leonardo Acosta, and Raúl Fernández. A traveling bilingual exhibition on Latin Jazz: The Perfect Combination, sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, opened in Washington D.C. in 2003 and will circle the nation for the next three years.  A generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities enabled Professors Ana María Hernández, Max Rodríguez and Gustavo Moretto to form a study group under the direction of consultant Edgardo Díaz-Díaz to delve into recent publications on the subject and listen to CD reissues of sources long unavailable. While the grant project resulted in a series of instructional modules to be used in three specific courses, we felt the need to extend our findings to a larger public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bunraku, Japanese puppet theater, is an unusually complex dramatic form, a collaborative effort among puppeteers, narrators, and musicians. Columbia University Libraries' Bunraku collection is one the most extensive in the world, documenting its rich performance tradition, which has been recognized by UNESCO as a "masterpiece" of humanity.  The Bunraku gallery is divided into plays, productions, authors, backstage subjects, kashira, and characters. It documents the form's revival in the second half of the 20th century, through more than 12,500 slides and nearly 7,000 black-and-white photographs of rehearsals and performances.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Completed in 2008 to the plan laid out in 1993, the Archive provides students and scholars with access to all of DGR's pictorial and textual works and to a large contextual corpus of materials, most drawn from the period when DGR's work first appeared and established its reputation (approximately 1848-1920), but some stretching back to the 14th-century sources of his Italian translations. All documents are encoded for structured search and analysis. The Rossetti Archive aims to include high-quality digital images of every surviving documentary state of DGR's works: all the manuscripts, proofs, and original editions, as well as the drawings, paintings, and designs of various kinds, including his collaborative photographic and craft works. These primary materials are transacted with a substantial body of editorial commentary, notes, and glosses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Not only was John Durang the earliest American-born theatre professional, but he also established a theatrical dynasty that continues to this day. In the course of his lifetime, Durang exercised nearly every ability that the stage offered or demanded, from dancer to actor, scene painter to puppeteer, choreographer to dancing master, arranger to translator, clown to acrobat, musician to manager, and more. He performed with the eminent theatrical organizations of the day, including the Old American Company, Ricketts Circus, and the Chestnut St. Theatre. He toured the major theatrical towns of the northeast, and, with a troupe of his own, he pioneered theatrical presentations in rural Maryland and Pennsylvania as well as in Quebec, Canada. In the course of Durang's life in the theatre, he participated in the transition of his homeland from colonial status to revolutionary upstart to newly established, independent nation. That course involved the shaping of a sense of being an American — a shaping played out on America's theatrical stages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>More than 1,000 hours of complete oral histories with 350 diverse  narrators are available online. The topics covered range from women's social history, labor and ethnic studies to Long Beach Area history and the musical developments in Southern California. Some of the interviews in the Asian American, Mexican American and women's history collections were recorded as early as 1972 and include interviews with narrators who were born in the mid- to late-19th century.    The entire interview can be heard, or segments can be accessed for an individual narrator or across interviews based on topic searches.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Welcome to the Virtual Oral/Aural History Archive of California State University, Long Beach. This site provides access to the full audio recordings of oral histories that have been deposited in Special Collections of the University Library. It enables the user to hear the voice, pitch, and rhythm of the narrations as well as the emotions these convey. It offers the actual spoken words of oral history narrators, rather than seeing a written version of them in the form of a transcript. While users are able to listen to the streamed sound, they cannot download it without authorization.

		<Abstract>This project presents the complex network of connections between a diverse group of historical actors through a document archive, annotated gallery, interactive maps, interpretive essays, and visualizations to emphasize connections between literacy, visual, and historical movements of Americans in Africa during the so-called "New Imperialism" era. It focuses on the period from 1862—when the United States officially recognized Liberia diplomatically—to 1919—the year that the belligerent powers of World War I signed the Versailles Treaty that made provisions for the redistribution of Germany's colonies, including those in Africa. 1919 also marked unprecedented anti-Black violence that erupted across the United States in hundreds of recorded lynchings of Black people and over 26 anti-Black race riots that took more Black lives. During this 57-year period, U.S. international relations with Africa and domestic policies affecting African Americans underwent substantial transformation.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Making Meaning of May 4: Teaching about the Kent State Shootings is a Web site featuring sample teaching plans, pointers to a wealth of May 4 resources, and the in-depth account in the successful nomination for the shootings site's designation as a National Historic Landmark in 2016. Web site materials are for use by educators from K–12 through college to teach students about the Kent State Shootings on May 4, 1970, and their meaning for today. On that day, members of the Ohio National Guard dispersed onlookers and student protestors against both the invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War and the presence of the National Guard on campus. When they appeared to be leaving the area and without warning, guardsmen turned, aimed, and fired, killing four Kent State students and wounding nine other Kent State students. The May 4 story relates to significant issues for students and citizens today, including the First Amendment and the importance of civil discourse even when we disagree.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Mesolex is a bilingual data portal for lexicosemantic data from a range of Mesoamerican languages. The primary resource material is accessible through two paths: Language Index and Topical Index. The first has been expanded to include 7 language groups and approximately 20 potential terminal languages. The second comprises a Library (pdfs of written resources), Audio and Video (catalogue and presentation of multimedia), and Flora &amp;amp; Fauna (links to all material in this semantic field be it text, audio, video, or lexicons). The Mesolex portal thus will include dictionaries, word lists, comparative word lists and dictionaries, comparative plant nomenclature, and other materials for understanding the languages and cultures of Mexican Indigenous communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Bridging the Antietam" is a project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and designed to boost student performance in composition classes and produce curricula to support writing across the disciplines by focusing on memory and its constructions as expressed through the folklore, narratives, and interpretation of history of the Antietam Creek region (western Maryland, south central Pennsylvania, and eastern West Virginia) that Hagerstown Community College (HCC) serves. The project also focuses on how memory changes history and our lives located within that history. The project not only helps students improve thinking, reading, and writing skills, but it also engages faculty and the community in productive discussions related to local folklore and history.  In Phase One of this project, students attending a Summer Bridge program at HCC will be the first to contribute their work to this site, primarily in the form of oral history interviews. As a local history project, the site will begin with basic information on a few select locations in the region, students will be encouraged to contribute work that further develops the site throughout the 2021-2022 academic year.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jonathan Street: Out of the Past is a 10 minute YouTube video created as a result of an oral history interview project for Bridging the Antietam project. In this video, HCC faculty conducted interviews with local businessmen Reggie Turner and Tereance Moore of the Western Maryland Community Development Corporation about their efforts to save and restore a historic cabin located at 335 Jonathan Street, Hagerstown Maryland. The cabin is located in a historically redlined community in Hagerstown, Maryland. This video is used by the Bridging the Antietam project as a curriculum tool and an example of place-based oral history video.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Borderlands of Southern Colorado is a Landmarks of American History and Culture Workshop presented by History Colorado and supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities. This place-based workshop in Colorado's San Luis Valley shares the multidimensional history of the American southwest through the intersections of geo-political, geographic, cultural, ethnic and religious landscapes. Through the workshops in summer 2021, educators will learn from a diverse and highly-qualified team of scholars, mentors, and community members to examine how shifting historic borders and borderlands in the region have impacted individual and community identity, power, government, ecosystems, economy, land and water, religion and spirituality; and how these borderland issues continue to resonate today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dubuque Museum of Art  Opens Major Exhibition of Vietnam War Photography  Citywide program connects local veterans' stories and iconic Associated Press images   For Immediate Release  Contact:                                         Katherine Schroeder Marketing &amp;amp; Engagement Manager  (563) 599-9486   October 15, 2021 (DUBUQUE, IA) – The Dubuque Museum of Art (DuMA) announces an expanded version of the Huntsville Museum of Art and the Associated Press traveling exhibition Vietnam: The Real War opening November 13. That collection features more than 50 iconic AP images that made and changed history—and won four Pulitzers. These photos transformed Americans' understanding of soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict.    DuMA expanded that experience to a citywide series of programs that ask, "How do we tell the truth in war?"  Alongside the AP photographs, visitors will explore artifacts carried by U.S. soldiers into battle. That installation—of a local collection—is inspired by Tim O'Brien's acclaimed book, The Things They Carried. Newly recorded oral histories bring local veterans' memories to life for the first time publicly—a collaboration by the Veterans Freedom Center, University of Dubuque, DuMA and the Grout Museum. Concurrent DuMA exhibitions include reporting of the Vietnam War by local journalists Bob Woodward Jr. and Jim Geladas and photos by Ron Testa, an official Navy combat photographer. MercyONE has created special museum resources about brain health and the effects of Agent Orange.  Vietnam: The Real War is made possible in part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities with support from the Dubuque Racing Association (DRA), Cottingham &amp;amp; Butler, the City of Dubuque's Arts and Culture Special Projects funds and Humanities Iowa.  Veterans' health programs are made possible by MercyOne. The public radio partner is Wisconsin Public Radio.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Welcome to a special issue of DuMA's Newsletter devoted to  Vietnam: The Real War. This issue is your guide to a community-wide series that explores the question "How do we tell the truth in war?" This is the first large-scale program to embrace our new mission:  We create engaging art experiences that excite, inspire, and connect our community. Two core goals are at the heart of this mission:  1) Connect our community. We strengthen the fabric of our  community by sparking connections across generations,  backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives.  2) Create engaging art experiences. We build these connections through active learning, making, and experimenting. Vietnam: The Real War offers a singular experience out of multiple perspectives that can be encountered in our galleries, online, and around town. Inside the Falb Family Gallery, you'll see iconic images  by the photojournalists who documented and changed history as part of The Associated Press's Saigon bureau. These photos transformed Americans' understanding of soldiers and civilians on both sides of  the conflict. You will also find an installation of artifacts carried by  U.S. soldiers into battle. That installation—of a local collection—is inspired by Tim O'Brien's acclaimed book, The Things They Carried. Concurrent exhibitions in the McNamer Gallery include photography and oral histories by local journalists who were reporting from Vietnam. Images taken by a Navy combat photographer from Chicago offer a different way of looking at the War.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This site aggregates a lot of the work that has been done on the Book of Fortresses digital project, especially the 3D GIS layers. It is in a near constant state of development as more fortresses are modeled or scanned and as the images of the book are annotated and structured in the database. The site is intended (primarily) to act as a portal into the digital work that is discussed in much greater detail in forthcoming written publications.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) curriculum features workshops, tutorials, glossaries, resources, reading materials, and more that have been developed at The Graduate Center, City Univerity of New York since 2016. Part of a 2019 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Office of Digital Humanities (ODH), DHRI's curriculum, which was originally developed for in-person workshops, was revised in Summer 2020 to better meet the needs of virtual instruction due to the covid-19 pandemic. While the curriculum has always been available openly on GitHub, this site creates a more user-friendly and functional interface that is open and free for public use.  The DHRI curriculum focuses on technical skills and concepts upon which additional technologies and tools rely. We call these foundational skills. Approximately one-third of all workshops at the Institute could be described as foundational: they introduce concepts such as the command line, version control &amp;amp; data collaboration, data literacy, and an introduction to programming with Python. The materials and workshops on this site are designed for users who are either unfamiliar with technology or could simply benefit from filling in gaps in their knowledge. Workshops and tutorials here encourage the use of open source technologies making them accessible to the widest possible audiences. We believe our emphasis on foundational skills demonstrates our commitment to empowering humanities researchers to become confident self-teachers and mentors in their own right who can make informed decisions about their research materials and methods that will lead to successful, sustainable, and long-term research goals.  Read more about our philosophy on the DHRI website.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Typing, searching, and archiving text can be a challenge for those working with historic materials in Latin American Studies - both for text in the Latin (Roman) script as well as text in other scripts, such as Maya hieroglyphs. One problem is that text may appear one way on a computer, but when sent to another device the characters can appear as a question mark, nonsense characters, or as boxes. SEI works with users to help get scripts and characters into Unicode, shepherding proposals through the multi-year approval process. Another goal of the project is to ensure proposals have been reviewed by experts. To date, SEI has assisted in getting over 70 scripts (or blocks of characters) into Unicode, including Egyptian hieroglyphs (Gardiner set), Anatolian hieroglyphs, and Linear A and B.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The SYRIOS Project began in 2016 both as an outgrowth of research into ancient Syria and in response to the current crisis within the modern region. By focusing on the dynamic presentation of Syrian material culture and the stories of its cities within the Greco-Roman period, we seek to:  transform public awareness of the ancient world and Syria in particular revitalize the perception of Syria as a diverse and vibrant metropolitan region exemplify the power of objects as testimony to everyday lives and struggles offer historical professionals an enhanced, digital data source and model applicable to research, teaching, and community outreach invite new perspectives into the research and engagement with this historic place  This current exhibit serves as Phase I and "Proof of Concept" for the overall project. It focuses on the history of the Syrian capital city of Antioch and the concept of studying coins as pieces of art and objects that move. From a technical perspective, this initial exhibit provided a platform for investigating overall design, interactivity, and usability.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Giovanni Battista Piranesi was an innovative graphic artist most known for his architectural studies of Rome and imaginary prisons. "The Digital Piranesi" aims to make this rare material accessible in a complete digital collection and, in an interactive digital edition, to make it visible, legible, and searchable in ways that the original works are not. The scale and breadth of Piranesi's works require innovative methods of presentation, discovery, and analysis. By digitally illuminating and enacting many of the graphic features of his designs, this project will provide new ways of seeing this rare and complex historical material.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Under "Exhibits and Experiences," the Museum is promoting the upcoming Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley exhibit, which is set to open on September 17, 2022. It highlights the five key stories: 1. Emmett's personal story, 2. How Emmett's murder fueled the Civil Rights Movement, 3. How a community and family have worked to keep Emmett's memory alive, 4. How the vandalized historical marker connects to us today, and 5. How together as a community we can commit to racial reconciliation. It states the other host venues and recognizes the institutions that made the touring exhibition possible.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Eiteljorg has taken the initiative to change the way museums typically tell Native Americans' stories by creating a space for the peoples themselves to tell their own stories. The capstone phase of Project 2021 is the complete reconstruction of the second-floor Native American Galleries, showcasing Native art in a modern space. The galleries provide a contextual experience organized around the themes of relation, continuation, and innovation, demonstrating the continuum of Native art.</Abstract>

Our goal is to overcome the barriers of time and technology to make this music easier to hear, appreciate, and understand. In this period, the broad genres we tend to take for granted, like blues, jazz, folk, country, or Latin, didn’t yet exist. Record companies were still figuring out how to market recorded music, and they looked for novel ways to re-package earlier conventions. For example, a record marketed as a “blues” in 1914 might sound like a marching band playing a tango. We want to make sense of these strange-sounding records.

Modern genre conventions often depend on some idea of racial or folk authenticity</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>The Allen County Museum will present the exhibition, The Ohio Presidents: Surprising Legacies, highlighting many interesting aspects of the Presidents and their lives.  The United States has had eight Presidents from Ohio, serving between the years 1841 and 1923.  Supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the exhibition will include various items related to the lives of the presidents and their wives, including clothing, china and personal items, such as hats, fans, walking sticks and more. In addition, campaign materials from their political life and emphasis on lesser-known facts will be highlighted. By looking at their lives before their presidencies, the exhibit can also draw connections between early events that may have affected their time as President.  This exhibition was originally organized by the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio and highlights past achievements of our Ohio presidents while also bringing to light the private side of their lives and careers.  Funding from the NEH provides for the creation of a virtual component, where viewers will have the opportunity to scan a QR code, providing additional information such as a three-dimensional view of an object or additional images and facts.  A first-time exhibition catalogue, A Snapshot of Democracy:  The Eight Ohio Presidents, will be available for purchase.  Public programs will also be provided throughout the run of the exhibition to provide educational opportunities for the public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities made it possible to give conservation treatment to 35 of the 103 books that comprise the Actas de Cabildo or Minutes of the City Council of the City of San Juan Bautista. The process included the evaluation, cleaning, punctual consolidation according to the degradation caused by iron gall ink or by insects, and the flattening of folds that prevent the reading of the text. This treatment was necessary to be able to safely digitize the bindings and make these valuable texts on the history of our Country accessible. Here is a sample of the consolidation treatment by the paper conservator Viviana van Vliet.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On the occasion of the celebration of the 500 years of the City of San Juan, the first documents that are digitized in the General Archive of Puerto Rico are the "Actas del Cabildo" of San Juan, Capital City. These documents date back to 1730. Thanks to the National Endowment for the Humanities, the most deteriorated volumes are treated by a paper conservator and, thanks to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, digitized. The process is not easy and requires a lot of care. In this infographic we explain how our work team safely digitizes these #documentaryjewels.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the past year, and thanks to a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the General Archive of Puerto Rico of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, has carried out a special project focused on the conservation of the Actas de Cabildo de San Juan. Once the project is finished, we invite the public to enjoy a small sample of the work done to ensure that these historic documents can be preserved for posterity. They will have the opportunity to learn about the various treatments carried out and their justification.   The selection of books will be exhibited in the Old Chapel, in the General Archive of Puerto Rico in Puerta de Tierra in San Juan from Thursday, August 4, 2022 to August 31, 2022 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  This project was made possible by the National Endowment for the Humanities:</Abstract>

Multimedia elements are presented corresponding to the mobile-optimized website's featured locations, including historic map layers, audio stories, photographs, and illustrations. A companion printed map showing locations of buried ships, historic structures, and historic landscape features is available for download as a PDF document from the website, so a visit to the Exploratorium is not necessary to pick up a map and enjoy the rich content of the website and walking tour. The physical map supplements the website's interactive map through its inclusion of marker icons which trigger augmented reality (AR) overlays within the web browser when users point their mobile device or computer's camera at the markers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Warriors in Uniform website and database is a key component of an educational initiative inspired by the National Native American Veterans Memorial, which recognizes and honors Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians who served in the military. The goal of Warriors in Uniform is to provide students, educators, scholars, and the public with information about the critical roles Native American service personnel have played in our nation's military and to preserve their stories of patriotism, loyalty, and bravery for future generations of native and non-native communities.  The content in this project, and the Lesson Plans that are included, provide an introduction to Native American Warriors in Uniform both on and off the battlefield and reflect a number of compelling educational themes available for exploration and study. Topics include a look at why Native Americans enlist in the military at higher percentages than any other ethnic group, despite being disenfranchised until after World War I. And the use of tribal languages as a military code in World War I and II even as Native American children were forced into boarding schools and deprived of their Native languages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>the Maria Edgeworth Letters project aims to create a standard digital edition of letters written by Maria Edgeworth that is as complete as possible, accessible to all, and fully searchable. Additionally, the project will provide a corpus of plain-text transcriptions of all of the letters for data mining, text analysis, and visualization. In providing this open access digital resource, we will be able to locate Edgeworth in her historical and social context and demonstrate her importance for studies of gender, race, religion, education, and science of and beyond the period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Corresponding with Quakers is the transcription site for the Ballitore Project. This project investigates and digitizes an archive of Quaker documents to reveal new perspectives on early feminist and abolitionist thought, while also confronting systemic racism in archival studies and the digital humanities through a collaboration between a large public research university, a public teaching-intensive university, and an HBCU: the University of California, Santa Barbara; California State University, Northridge; and Howard University. The project focuses on the Ballitore Collection, an archive of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Quaker correspondence and journals held at UCSB's Special Research Collections. This unique, virtually unknown collection sheds light on the intersection of gender, race, class, and religion in the period, a turbulent moment in which British and American abolitionists were pushing to end the slave trade. The primary author is Mary Leadbeater (1758-1826), an Anglo-Irish poet and essayist and central figure in Quaker circles. Quakers were key players in abolition despite their small numbers and secondary political status, and they also exhibited proto-feminist tendencies with their emphasis on female preaching. But the collection also reflects many structural hierarchies, as its contents were assembled by a middle-class white woman and the Black voices in the collection are filtered through a white framework—from that of Leadbeater, who first compiled the documents, to that of its twentieth-century archivization and dissemination. The collection opens onto a host of identities from the eighteenth-century British Empire and early United States to today.  To find new ways of surfacing these competing perspectives, Hidden Archives applies computational techniques to a manuscript archival collection. We are using two primary techniques: topic modeling and network analysis. Topic modeling is a method that breaks documents and collections into lists</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This community transcription project seeks to engage the public with the People's Contest Digital Archive through transcription of the diaries and personal accounts collected by the Archive from the Eberly Family Special Collections Library at Penn State and from archives and museums across Pennsylvania.  By transcribing these diaries, volunteers will assist scholars who study the lived experience of Pennsylvanians during the mid-19th century, or who wish to conduct text analysis of these personal accounts. They will also assist the University Libraries in establishing workflows for building and maintaining libraries of text from our digital collections as objects of research and study. Finally, they will themselves learn more about the history of the people and places of Pennsylvania during the Civil War era.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Beginning in late 2021 and continuing through 2023, PEN America and the American Historical Association (AHA) are co-hosting Flashpoints: Free Speech in American History, Culture and Society. This series presents the fascinating and complex history of free speech in American democracy to public audiences in cities across the country. The historical flashpoints highlight pivotal moments in which artists, activists, writers, filmmakers, and intellectuals tested the limits of free speech, challenging the public to redefine "freedom" and realize it anew for populations and causes that were at risk of having their liberties denied.   This educational resource hub features videos, primary sources and further resources culled from the PEN America Digital Archive. In 2023 downloadable discussion guides tailored for middle school and high school educators will be included.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The government-led process that came to be known as "Indian Removal" occurred over a period of many years and involved numerous tribes of Native people. Georgians were singularly aggressive in their resolve to remove their Native populations, primarily Muscogee and Cherokee, and had secured what they believed was a firm promise from the U.S. government to do so when they surrendered the part of their claimed territory in 1802 which eventually became the states of Alabama and Mississippi. These long-simmering tensions finally came to a boil with the election of populist U.S. President Andrew Jackson in 1828, leading to the Indian Removal Act and the eventual forced removal of tribes in the Southeast. This series of events later came to be known as the Trail of Tears, and for the Cherokee Nation it dealt a devastating challenge to their long struggle to maintain sovereignty in their Appalachian homeland. The Trail of Tears is now a federally recognized National Historic Trail administered by the National Park Service, covering over 5,045 miles across nine states, interpreting what has long been recognized as a pivotal event in the history of our nation. This driving tour focuses on the military round-up that occurred in the spring of 1838 in Northwest Georgia. This tour, developed by the Funk Heritage Center with funding from the Georgia Humanities and in partnership with the Georgia chapter of the Trail of Tears Association and an NEH Landmarks teacher workshop, will give you a better understanding of the circumstances leading up to the Cherokee Removal, the initial round-up of the Cherokee by government troops, and the effect of these horrifying events on the Cherokee who lived in present-day Georgia. While some of the stops on this tour have only a historic marker to indicate the events that happened there, others are fully-developed interpretive sites and museums that grapple with the effects of the Trail of Tears historically, individually, and collectively.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>OpenTour Builder is an open source software platform for building geospatial tours that are optimized for mobile devices. OpenTour Builder continues to be developed by the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, who began development of the web app in 2014 in its first iteration. The current version of OpenTour Builder, v. 3.0, was launched in March of 2019, and continues to be improved.

With this tool, tour builders can easily create interactive, attractive tours that guide users from stop to stop using their smartphone's GPS and OpenTour Builder's native Google Maps instructions. At each location, the designer can include images, video, text, and external links to provide historical and cultural context, tying that information to the physical space.

An Emory-supported instance of OpenTour is now available for those who intend to use the technology for educational purposes or the exhibition of research. Tours need to fit within the ECDS and Emory mission. The Emory Center for Digital</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>"The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even past." Barack Obama used these words in 2008 to argue that we can only truly understand—and begin to overcome— the bitterness of modern race relations through a brave and accurate accounting of history. Obama's line borrows from one that appears in a book by Southern author William Faulkner. In other words, he turned to literature as a source of wisdom about the difficult subject of race in America, and built on what he found there to imagine new pathways towards justice, healing, and unity.  Similarly, the "Deeper Than Our Skins" theme is grounded in literature that can help us look beneath the surface of racism in America to reveal how the past is alive in the present. This theme uses powerful stories of oppression, resistance, suffering, and triumph to identify the roots of racialized experience in the United States, and to inspire discussions about how to construct more equitable futures for the people in our country and world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The old adage goes "children should be seen and not heard." That conventional wisdom implies that speaking up and out is the exclusive realm of adults. It also suggests that children and young people don't have important things to say — that they should stay out of adult conversation.  The truth is that young people have been vital to making change by speaking and showing up in the face of adversity. Take Joan of Arc, for example. In 1429, while just 18 years old, she led a French army to the besieged city of Orléans in a victory over the English.   But we don't have to go back to 15th-century France to find young heroes. On November 14, 1960, 6-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first African American child to integrate a white Southern elementary school. Her mother and U.S. marshals had to escort young Ruby to class because of violent mobs in her hometown of New Orleans. Bridges was born the same year that Brown v. Board of Education made "separate but equal" public spaces illegal, and her bravery was a milestone in the Civil Rights movement. There are countless examples of young people speaking out and taking a stand against injustice.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Produced, directed, written, and edited by Oscar®-nominated and triple-Sundance award-winning filmmaker Arthur Dong, "The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor" is a singular documentary on one of the most well-known survivors of the Cambodian genocide. It uses an iconic movie, The Killing Fields, as a springboard to combine history and biography into a dramatic transnational narrative. The feature-length film fuses animation with the spoken word, interlacing a rich palette of archival material. Anchored by an adaptation of Ngor’s richly layered autobiography, Survival in the Killing Fields (co-authored with Roger Warner), the film serves as a personal indictment of the global politics that were thrust upon Southeast Asia, and the consequences that continue to surface today as Cambodia grabbles with corruption, poverty, and the impunity of aging former Khmer Rouge leaders still at large.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Coins of the Bactrian and Indo-Greek Rulers (BIGR) is an innovative research tool which provides a typology and catalogue of the coins issued under the Graeco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kings and queens who ruled over an area consisting of parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, eastern Iran, and Pakistan. From the initial period of independence of the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom from the Seleucid empire under Diodotus I in the mid-third century BCE to the final Indo-Greek rulers at the beginning of the first century CE, coins provide the best, and in many cases, only evidence of the sovereigns under whom they were produced. Given the lack of other sources, much about the history of this period is uncertain and BIGR aims to make clear the limits of our knowledge, for example, by avoiding mint attributions and specific dates.  BIGR is organized using a new typology of Bactrian and Indo-Greek coins, created by Gunnar Dumke and Simon Glenn, published first here. The current version will soon link to coins in the major collections of the American Numismatic Society, Ashmolean Museum, Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Münzkabinett of the State Museum of Berlin, British Museum, and the Fitzwilliam Museum. A print volume with commentary on the BIGR typology and other aspects of the coinages, published by the American Numismatic Society, will follow in 2024. Funding for the project, a joint initiative between the American Numismatic Society and the Ashmolean Museum and Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents at the University of Oxford, was provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council.  BIGR includes Kharo??hi Unicode characters in legends and for control marks throughout the typology. A Kharo??hi font might not be installed by default in your operating system. We recommend the open source font at https://fontsource.org/fonts/noto-sans-kharoshthi.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Circulation has always been a problem for anyone interested in periodicals. Data have remained difficult to obtain and verify. Scholars, for example, often depend on unreliable and anecdotal circulation numbers cited in letters or memoirs.   The Circulating American Magazines Project addresses the critical absence of reliable circulation information by digitizing data publishers submitted to the Audit Bureau of Circulations (A.B.C.), building a robust database of circulation data covering the period 1919 to 1972. This data was extracted from the A.B.C. Blue Book, Periodical Publisher's Statements, copies of which are held at a handful of research institutions and the archive of the Alliance of Audited Media.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This site is a digital companion and archive for the two summer institutes Professor Noonan directed in 2015 and 2020, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).   At the 2015 institute, faculty fellows participated in discussions led by experts in American periodicals; visited sites important to the rise of New York's periodical press; attended Digital Humanities workshops; and read scholarship on periodical history and pedagogy. Because of the pandemic, the 2020 institute was held fully online. While we were unable to access the archives and streets of New York in person, participants considered issues related to space and place, social justice, and press freedom with renewed urgency.   The site features taped lectures, virtual walking tours, reading lists, and additional resources developed at the institute, aimed at fostering continued discussion and inquiry.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This StoryMap aims to offer an accessible introduction to the complicated issues at hand in debates about what kinds of living arrangements are ideal for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It is a companion project to my book in progress, On the Spectrum: Refugees from Nazi Austria and the Politics of Disability and Belonging in the UK and US. I focus on the Camphill movement, an international network of residential communities were people and with and without disabilities live together in extended-family style households and work together on the land and in the crafts. Disabled community members are cared for by their non-disabled household members, most of whom choose not to earn an income. Rather than paying them wages, the community provides for their housing, food, and other needs. Camphill's first community was founded in Scotland in 1939 by refugee physicians from Nazi Austria. They had been trained in Curative Education at the University of Vienna Medical School, one of the research centers from which the autism diagnosis emerged. Today, there are about 140 Camphill and Camphill-inspired communities in Europe, North America, and a few other places around the world. Camphill is championed by some disability self-advocates, allies, and scholars—including Temple Grandin—and strongly criticized by others, which makes it a useful example through which to unpack debates not only about housing, but about disability inclusion and belonging more broadly.   I created this project for three reasons: First, to investigate whether there was a spatial dimension to Camphill's history that would generate insights I might otherwise have missed (there was). Second, to share visual material—images and interactive maps—that are difficult or impossible to include in traditional publications. And third, to communicate the complexity of a fraught topic accessibly, to a broad audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the years following the publication of the first and second editions of Leaves of Grass, Walt Whitman began compiling a scrapbook. It's unclear what purpose he had in creating the massive document, comprised of portions of textbooks, magazines, newspaper clippings, and manuscript notes—more than 1,000 individual text surfaces in total—all relating, in some way, to world history and geography. Whitman in these years was both searching for ways to extend the vision he had laid out in the first two editions of Leaves, and also working and drafting in a variety of other genres. What we do know is that, in the late 1850s, as the nation appeared more and more in danger of fracturing, Whitman created a document that, between two hardbound covers, brought the whole world together, a laborious and sprawling act of union—and a document that contained the seeds of several works that found their way into print in the following years, including a number of poems in the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass.  Although scholars have been aware of this scrapbook, it has received scant attention, in part because it is housed in a relatively small collection of Whitman materials (the Bayley / Whitman Collection at Ohio Wesleyan University), and in part because of the daunting size of the artifact itself. With the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the assistance of Special Collections staff at Ohio Wesleyan University Libraries, the Walt Whitman Archive has digitized the scrapbook in its current state. Our transcription includes all material relevant to the scrapbook's theme and surfaces marked by Whitman; we have omitted transcriptions of unrelated printed verso material and printed text formatting such as italics and underlining, and have included in brackets descriptions of charts, tables, and figures for ease of searching.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Charles W. Chesnutt Archive seeks to make Chesnutt's writings conveniently accessible to all. Writing in the years after Reconstruction as white supremacy took new virulent forms, Chesnutt addressed topics of vital concern, then and now, including race, identity, violence, class, and the familial and economic relations that zigzag across America's color line.  Drawing on the resources of libraries and collections from around the world, the open-access, online Charles W. Chesnutt Archive is the most comprehensive record of works by and about Chesnutt.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This website documents the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on musicians and communities throughout the United States. The site contains 240 short video interviews conducted during 2020 with musicians in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 U.S. territories. Among the music genres represented are Native American traditions, jazz, blues, gospel, country, zydeco, norteño, mariachi, salsa, rock, hip hop, klezmer, and Western classical, as well as traditions from such countries as Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, Brazil, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Ghana, Ethiopia, Turkey, Iraq, India, Indonesia, China, and Japan. The website also includes biographical notes on each musician interviewed and an interpretative essay. Collectively, the interviews offer a snapshot of what it was like to live in a society in which, for the first time in a century, concert halls, nightclubs, schools, places of worship, and other music settings largely turned silent.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Produced, directed, written, and edited by Oscar®-nominated and triple-Sundance award-winning filmmaker Arthur Dong, The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor is a singular documentary on one of the most well-known survivors of the Cambodian genocide. It uses an iconic movie, The Killing Fields, as a springboard to combine history and biography into a dramatic transnational narrative. The feature-length film fuses animation with the spoken word, interlacing a rich palette of archival material. Anchored by an adaptation of Ngor’s richly layered autobiography, Survival in the Killing Fields (co-authored with Roger Warner), the film serves as a personal indictment of the global politics that were thrust upon Southeast Asia, and the consequences that continue to surface today as Cambodia grabbles with corruption, poverty, and the impunity of aging former Khmer Rouge leaders still at large.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>The Duchamp Research Portal is an online platform that aggregates a selection of digitized archival holdings and museum collections at three partner institutions (PMA, Centre Georges Pompidou, and AMD) to make a significant portion of primary source materials related to the French artist Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968) accessible and discoverable through a single interface. The outcome of eight years of collaboration between institutions across the globe, the creation and public debut of the portal connects researchers, scholars, and the general public to Duchamp's subversive and inquisitive work. The platform is dynamic and will continue to grow and improve through new collections and technological advances. Today, the portal hosts nearly 50,000 digitized primary sources including correspondences, drawings, technical plans, photographs, exhibition ephemera, newspaper clippings, and scholarly articles. Some highlights include the artist's passport and vaccination record, magazine article proofs, and photographs of Duchamp by the surrealist photographer Man Ray (1890–1976).  The portal is easily searchable by object, type, contributor, timeframe, and person, and features 23 finding aids which echo the arrangement of the collections in their original institutions. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of all three institutions, the Duchamp Research Portal is a free, accessible, and first-of-its-kind primary resource for anyone interested in learning about Duchamp.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>The Duchamp Research Portal is sectioned into Documents and Museum Collections, reflecting the partnering institutions’ administration of the materials. Consisting of nearly 50,000 digitized images and accompanying metadata, the site has served more than 28,000 users from over 140 countries to date. Archival materials can be searched for by object type, contributor, timeframe, and person, as well as through individual collections. In the future, the partners hope to continue refining the portal, collaborating with other institutions, adding collections, and enhancing search functionality.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>This is a task-based, open-access Spanish language curriculum that centers Blackness in Latin America and Black language learners. It is a free resource for Teachers to use in their Spanish language classrooms. This curriculum was designed based off of a needs analysis study that we conducted with over 100 Spanish language learners at Florida Memorial University (South Florida's only HBCU) and Florida International University (the largest HSI to graduate Hispanic students in the nation). It is thus based on students' real-world needs.  Teachers will find units with accompanying lesson plans and tasks. Every lesson plan is designed following a task-based methodology. Assessment is also task-based and criterion-referenced. For each unit, we have created a Community Leader video that features a Black scholar and/or community leader who uses Spanish in their life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Teach in Spanglish is founded on a simple idea: while just a small fraction of today's college students will progress to the high-level, all-in-Spanish courses offered by language departments, more than two-thirds enter college with the ability to understand Spanish when given context in English, support from their instructor, and time. If you are a professor whose research analyzes materials in Spanish or Spanglish, you can teach in Spanglish regardless of how comfortable you feel speaking in Spanish. If you are a teacher who can read a basic text in Spanish, you can also teach in Spanglish.</Abstract>

This free collection of activities, lessons, and further readings is intended to support students by helping them:  - Make connections between the past and the present  - Critically examine history - Shape perceptions of Africa and expand their worldview  The Teacher's Guide begins and ends with a series of activities to contextualize the Caravans of Gold story and to help students understand what is at stake in learning this history. Individual lessons explore different facets of the story through key objects and case studies. We offer prompts for looking closely at objects, and we share background information that can help teachers and students learn more about medieval trans-Saharan trade. The Recommended Resources document contains resources for extending your exploration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As Americans of all backgrounds confront structural racism and seek to understand our own roles and responsibilities, learning about racism and its history is critical.

		<Abstract>Our project website contains biographical essays, interpretive essays, and (eventually) demographic data visualizations as well as access to a searchable database for users who wish to query our dataset for their own research.   Sharing Stories from 1977 captures the history of the 1977 National Women's Conference, the only federally funded, bipartisan supported, and most diverse gathering of American women in U.S. history. This conference was held as the U.S. corollary to the United Nations International Women's Year initiative after the first World Conference on Women in Mexico City. Today, it stands out for the comprehensive National Plan of Action passed by delegates, addressing issues that speak to our own times from LGBTQ rights to childcare.  Our ambition is to present all the stories of all conference attendees by the NWC's fiftieth anniversary in 2027. In addition to the almost 2,000 elected national delegates, we also want to include the 150,000 plus participants in lead up state and territorial meetings. Finally, we are incorporating the thousands more staff, volunteers, onsite observers, international dignitaries, presidentially-appointed commissioners, journalists, and three First Ladies. We also plan to track the impact of the NWC in two important ways: by tracing the legislative outcomes of the 26 policy areas outlined in The Spirit of Houston report and by examining the imprint the NWC left on advocacy networks and political careers. We are finding, through initial research, that not only were Americans more civically engaged in the 1970s than scholars assume, "being there" in Houston was a significant catalyst in many people's lives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Welcome to People, Religion, Information Networks, and Travel – Migration in the Early Modern World. How did news travel in the seventeenth century? What role did religion play in people's mobility? Help us transcribe Quaker letters to understand how their authors' social and religious networks shaped their movements. PRINT is a collaborative digital humanities project that traces the communication networks of early modern European religious minorities (Anabaptists, Quakers and Pietists) and the ways they shaped the dynamic patterns of migration in the Atlantic world. Housed at the University of Central Florida, PRINT is creating a digital repository of letters and tools for visualizing the complex connections the correspondence reveals. We seek to understand the links that arose in response to religious persecution and missionary work and the way those connections influenced migration flows. Our goal is to work with archives and citizen transcribers to provide access to documents not readily available and to create digital tools to foster new textual and network analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While roaming about St. Croix, people wonder about the stone towers dotting the landscape. Many of these towers were windmills built for crushing sugar cane (why we use the word windmills, not sugar mills). Of the 150-160 windmills for crushing sugar cane ever built on St. Croix, 119 have been located. This website provides the location of each windmill, how each one appears on historic maps, and current photos. Explore this website to learn more about specific places of interest, how mapmakers presented St. Croix, and how sugar was manufactured. Each estate where a windmill may have been built has a dedicated page to review the history as depicted on historic maps and how it currently appears.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Coral Bay Community Council (CBCC) has undertaken a project with two goals: (1) accomplish the necessary work to register two historic schoolhouses in the East End and Coral Bay area of St. John in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Virgin Islands Registry of Historic Buildings, Sites and Places (VIRHBSP), and (2) encourage public interest in preservation and knowledge of cultural and historic properties in the Coral Bay area.  The impetus for this project is to provide recognition and protection for two important historical and cultural places on St. John – schoolhouses that were attended by parents and grandparents and other elders in recent memory. The project documents this local history so it remains accessible for future generations and involves local culture bearers so they can learn key research techniques to conduct this type of work in the future, building local capacity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using selected moving images from Northeast Historic Film, this project employed a team approach for open access. The project emphasized contextualization of archival footage, building tools to provide access to articles, scene-by-scene notes, both item-level and collection-level descriptive records. Three China scholars provided content and used the work in their scholarship and teaching.  The project was built on archival footage of China, 1928-1936, with rights to reuse. Teachers participated in evaluation.  White Paper available, http://www.neh.gov/ODH/Default.aspx?tabid=111&amp;amp;id=21</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Main Street, Carolina is designed to encourage and facilitate the production of digital projects about the history of towns and cities in North Carolina. We work in collaboration with local organizations around the state to originate, plan, and develop online projects that engage local audiences around the history of their communities through the "location" of multimedia content on historical maps.  A unique feature of Main Street, Carolina is its system for displaying and manipulating more than 1000 large-scale, color, fire insurance maps of 45 towns and cities in North Carolina published between 1885 and 1923. Projects can also use more than 300 other georeferenced historical maps of North Carolina drawn from North Carolina Maps. As its name suggests, Main Street, Carolina recovers and represents the turn-of-the-century history of "downtowns" in North Carolina in an especially powerful way, enabling a wide range of users to discover previously invisible connections among people, events, stories, images, and places. It also encourages them to connect that history with the lived experience and built environments of their communities today.</Abstract>

Using these tools, teachers can help students see how connections among art works, primary &amp;amp; secondary documents, and images reveal themes and movements in American art, history, and life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Grotta Scaloria, or Scaloria Cave, was discovered in 1931. A rock fall had closed the entrance to the cave for thousands of years. Excavations for an aqueduct in 1931revealed a fissure in the ground which was actually a break in the ceiling of the cave. Exploration of the cave revealed burials, Early Neolithic pottery, flint tools, polished stone tools, and many bones. A short study was conducted in 1936, but World War II intervened, and stopped exploration of the cave by all except a few tombaroli, or tomb robbers. Scaloria Cave was rediscovered by several young speleologists in 1967. Beginning that year, faculty and students from the University of Genoa, led by Professor Santo Tinè, along with the speleologists and members of the Apulian Antiquities Department, undertook several limited explorations and reported their findings at national and international conferences. This inspired the late Marija Gimbutas, Professor of European Archaeology at UCLA, to join her Italian colleague Professor Tinè in the project "The Neolithic of South-East Italy," jointly sponsored by UCLA and the University of Genoa. They conducted two excavation seasons in 1978 and 1979, along with a 1980 study season that took place in the National Archaeological Museum in nearby Manfredonia, on the Adriatic, where many of the materials from Tinè's earlier explorations of the Cave and those from the joint excavations are stored. Scaloria was "lost" again as the scholars then moved in different directions. Professor Gimbutas died in 1994 but during her last weeks asked, or rather insisted, that Dr. Ernestine Elster, also of UCLA, promise to see that the Scaloria Cave material was published. With the help of Professor John Robb of Cambridge University, Professor Tinè, and many other participants from the United States and Europe, Dr. Elster has worked to publish the materials, and have this website created</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The papers of Eliza Lucas Pinckney (1722–1793) and her daughter Harriott Pinckney Horry (1748–1830) document the lives of two observant and articulate founding-era women who were members of one of South Carolina's leading families. Their letters, diaries, and other documents span nearly a century (1739–1830) and provide a window on politics, social events, and people of the late colonial and early national periods. They richly detail the daily life of maintaining family ties and managing households and plantations. Pinckney's correspondence illustrates the importance of women's social connections and transatlantic friendships. Horry's correspondence documents the strength of personal ties that linked the elite families of the North and the South to each other even as connections were threatened by disputes over slavery, commercial differences, and political and constitutional conflict.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The focus of this URL is the statue of Caligual now at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.&amp;#x0D; The website overall is devoted to studying ways in which 3D digital technologies can be applied to the capture, representation and interpretation of sculpture from all periods and cultures. Up to now, 3D technologies have been used in fruitful ways to represent geometrically simple artifacts such as pottery or larger-scale structures such as buildings and entire cities. With some notable exceptions, sculpture has been neglected by digital humanists. The Digital Sculpture Project will fill this gap by focusing on the following issues:&amp;#x0D; •3D data capture and documentation&amp;#x0D; •Digital restoration&amp;#x0D; •Digital tools for the processing and analysis of digitized sculpture, including colorization&amp;#x0D; •Analysis of earlier forms of sculptural reproduction, particularly the cast.&amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The impulse to tell stories about courtship, love, and intimacy is universal and timeless. Romance fiction, which holds the largest share of the consumer book market, taps into archetypal stories in ways that are culturally and historically revealing. The Popular Romance Project Website — combining video segments and scholarly essays with games and primary sources — will shape and facilitate a substantive discussion about the writing, production, and consumption of popular romance. It will engage a mass audience in thoughtful and provocative exploration of the roles romance narratives play in popular culture and individual lives. The website serves as the core component of the larger Popular Romance Project that includes a feature-length documentary film, an academic symposium (Library of Congress), and a national library program (American Library Association).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Continuing its organizational strategy of using digital technology to attract and engage visitors, Historic Hudson Valley created a mobile app entitled "Montgomery Place: An American Arcadia." Designed for use by on-site visitors as well as off-site learners, this free mobile app serves as a contemporary alternative to traditional printed guidebooks and audio tours. It allows self-guided visitors to see additional images and historic footage related to 18 points of interest on the landscape of the estate. The app serves to enrich the self-guided experience and draw people to parts of the estate that they otherwise might have missed. It also enables visitors to view a virtual tour of the mansion when the mansion is closed. The app supports the overall interpretive themes, provides a quick reference of "who's who at Montgomery Place," gives three self-guided tour routes of varying lengths, captures seasonality at the site, and offers historic footage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Digital Index of Middle English Verse (http://www.dimev.net) includes all the records of Middle English verse collected in the 1943 Index of Middle English Verse [hereafter "IMEV"] and its 1965 Supplement, while adding the first two and last two lines for each witness to every record.  The original print edition only included a first line from a random witness.  Linne R. Mooney and Elizabeth Solopova collected most of the data for the Oxford and Cambridge libraries, as well as numerous smaller private and public collections (with support from NEH in 1995-97 ). Mosser was invited to collaborate in 2008 and marked up the data in XML encoding and, with Prof. Dave Radcliffe's assistance, created a robust online edition with over 7,000 records and 19,000 witnesses. The NEH Summer Stipend allowed Mosser to collect transcription data from fourteen London-area archives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Funded by the Ford Foundation, the first stage of this project included twenty-seven staff members and grant consultants who scanned and uploaded more than 130 of Margaret Walker's personal journals, dating from the 1930s to the 1990s and totaling more than 10,000 handwritten pages. Those journals constitute just 10 percent of the Margaret Walker Papers–one of the single largest manuscript collections of a modern, black female writer anywhere in the world. Thanks to a federal grant from NEH, the second stage will allow the Margaret Walker Center to digitize another forty percent of Margaret Walker's collection, making half of her papers available online to the public. For researchers and others who wish to access this material, the website is ready for immediate use.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Justice Talking is a national reading and discussion program for service volunteers featuring discussions that use short philosophical and literary texts, images, videos and news articles on the nature of justice, service, and related themes. In partnership with the Ohio Humanities Council, the Illinois Humanities Council, and the Project on Civic Reflection, ServeOhio hosts AmeriCorps program staff and members for Justice Talking facilitation training and presents curriculum.OHC Logo&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Workshop participants become more familiar with the art of humanities-based discussion and have a better understanding of the importance of civic reflection. Participants leave the workshop prepared to lead similar discussions and to advocate for reflection that complements individual service efforts.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Project on Civic Reflection (PCR) leads discussions, blending brief presentations, group discussion and hands-on facilitation. Participants take turns leading discussions and receiving feedback, learn different types of questions to pose and receive guidance on handling the responsibilities and challenges of facilitation.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Libretto is an Android app that patrons can use to read and study media-enhanced editions of texts and musical scores that exist in multiple versions using the newly-released ePub 3.0 ebook format and the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. The first release of the app (now available for free download on the Google Play store and from GitHub) includes a variorum (multiple version) edition of the libretto and score of the once enormously popular but now largely forgotten 1866 melodrama, The Black Crook. Using the software developed for this project, readers are able to read the libretto and sheet music in multiple versions and hear the associated music. We believe Libretto is the first open source software capable of presenting variorum and multimodal ebooks on an Android platform.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A number of institutions that have significant New England Indian collections (Yale University, the Connecticut State Library, the Connecticut Historical Society, the Massachusetts Archives, and the National Archives of the United Kingdom) have organized into a cooperative endeavor called The Yale Indian Papers Project to address these problems by publishing an electronic database known as The New England Indian Papers Series.  The Series represents a scholarly critical edition of New England Native American primary source materials gathered presently from the partner institutions into one robust virtual collection, where the items are digitized, transcribed, annotated, and edited to the highest academic standards and then made freely available over the Internet, using open-source software. By providing annotated transcriptions, the Project's editors provide the Series users with useful information within a well-researched and balanced context necessary to understand the complexities of the historical record.  Thus, the Series offers students, educators, researchers, Native American tribal members, and the general public, visual and intellectual access to significant historical knowledge for the purposes of teaching, scholarly analysis, and research.  In doing so, the Series furthers the Project's mission and the missions of its cooperative partner institutions to encourage new scholarship, and promote a greater understanding and appreciation of New England's earliest culture among a broader segment of the general public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What do the digital humanities look like on your campus? What types of projects are your faculty undertaking? Which will require longer-term support, and where will that support come from? What roles do your service units, centers, and digital labs play in the various life-cycle stages, and is this clear to faculty? This toolkit will help administrators create a coherent institutional strategy for supporting digital humanities activities and the valuable outputs that they generate.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The toolkit walks you through three steps, each with its own set of instructions and supporting materials. Step 1 will help you evaluate who on your campus is creating digital projects, the problems they are facing, and where they are finding help now. Step 2 offers a framework to analyze where there are overlaps and gaps in the services offered by various units on campus, for all stages of the digital project lifecycle. Step 3 provides tools to facilitate meetings with key stakeholders to develop plans to support faculty and their digital research projects in a way that is in line with campus mission and priorities.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Behind the Veil Oral History Project was undertaken by Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies from 1993 to 1995. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the primary purpose of this documentary project was to record and preserve the living memory of African American life during the age of legal segregation in the American South, from the 1890s to the 1950s. Over the span of three summers, teams of researchers conducted oral history interviews with more than one thousand elderly black southerners who remembered that period of legal segregation. The audio-cassette tapes and selected transcripts of the 1,260 interviews in this collection capture the vivid personalities, poignant personal stories, and behind-the-scenes decision-making that bring to life the African American experience in the South during the late-19th to mid-20th century. It is the largest single collection of Jim Crow oral histories in the world, housed in the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and Culture, in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp;amp; Manuscript Library at Duke University.&amp;#x0D; 410 of the 1,260 interviews have been digitized and made available on this site totaling about 725 hours of recorded audio. 165 of the interviews include transcripts comprising more than 15,000 pages of text. &amp;#x0D; 310 of the interviews in the digital collection were conducted with North Carolina residents. The Charlotte and Enfield regions of North Carolina are especially represented in the collection; there are also many recordings from the Durham, James City, New Bern and Wilmington regions. The North Carolina recordings were all digitized as part of the Triangle Research Libraries Network's project "Content, Context and Capacity: A Collaborative Large-Scale Digitization Project on the Long Civil Rights Movement in North Carolina." Other collections from that project are also accessible as Duke digital collections. &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Focusing on a neglected but important repertory of polyphonic songs from mid-sixteenth-century France, this unique project puts old books before a diverse audience of modern scholars and musicians in ways that will prompt renewed understanding of these cultural artifacts and their meanings. It is dedicated to sixteen sets of books expertly crafted by the Parisian printer Nicolas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568. In them, we can trace changing literary tastes, musical fashions, and above all the impact of the relatively new medium of printing on musical culture of the day.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Here readers will find facsimiles of all sixteen sets of books, plus modern transcriptions, scholarly commentaries, and tools for research. There are also links to related projects sponsored by the CESR, including a broader database of the sixteenth-century chanson repertory, a project devoted to the reconstruction of pieces with missing voice parts, and another devoted to the study and editing of the literary texts of the chansons themselves. All of this has been assembled under a number of headings designed to encourage researchers, students, and performers to explore the rich world of the chanson at mid century. We invite readers to make productive use of these resources, and to tell us about what you have learned from them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>http://edillo4.wix.com/equiano-gis#!essay&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Atlantic World is a spatial concept.  Literally, the Atlantic is an ocean, and in recent years, historians and literary scholars have increasingly called upon this ocean to define the field of study in which they work.  Scholars who might once have worked in the areas of early American literature or British imperial history have traded a politically and nationally delimited field for a spatially and geographically defined one.  There are many good reasons for this development, not least of which is the challenge and excitement of constructing a field imaginary in which the nation-state does not (for those who work in pre-national American contexts, for instance) anachronistically organize the canon of meaningful works and the shape of intellectual inquiry.  And indeed, the Atlantic world is a term that seems to catch at the lived reality of the many people, goods, ideas, biota, and texts that circulated between and among Europe, Africa, and the Americas in the period of European colonization of the Americas, as well as in later periodsperiods that may, in turn, be productively viewed in terms of the neo-imperial and/or postcolonial national cultures accreted on the bones of this (Atlantic) colonial history.  But what are the ramifications of turning to a spatial term to define a field of history and literature?  More broadly, we might ask, what is the relation of Atlantic space to the humanities work being performed under the rubric of its title?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, DAAR presents ways for scholars to examine data at varying scales and with multiple dimensions. For studies using data from the US census, voting statistics, or any other spatially-referenced data, the tools permit researchers to group and map categories easily and in new ways or to aggregate data by user-defined classifications. The tools enhance GIS to make maps more complex, more visually dynamic, and more easily interpreted.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Welcome to Indiana University Art Museum Pictures America, a web module for fifth-graders funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The sixteen examples of artwork illustrated here represent the museum's extensive American painting and works on paper collections and serve to complement the images and themes of the NEH's website Picturing America.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Reflecting the museum education department's philosophy of building visitors' knowledge through inquiry-based explorations of the artwork, this web module was designed to be image-driven. For example, as the cursor moves over the image of the artwork, bullets of information pop up at appropriate places. Questions are provided in a right-hand-side menu to encourage and challenge further visual exploration and analyses. A Teachers' Resource section with essays, questions for the classroom, and curriculum materials for each image is also provided.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The IU Art Museum has created a gallery tour program for fifth grade students called "American History through Art." To arrange tours of the museum's American collection, please contact Patsy Rahn, the museum's tour coordinator, at prahn@indiana.edu.

		<Abstract>One of the essential approaches in preservation of architectural heritage is documentation of 3D geometries and surface textures of historical buildings. However, precise colour information, irrespective of lighting effects, which is an intrinsic property of the surface materials of building interiors and exteriors, has not been accurately documented in the scale of whole building surfaces, except for small sample areas. Every day the materials of historical buildings are decaying and their colours are fading. The goal of this project is to develop a method to assist in recording and documenting the intrinsic chromaticity information of building interiors and exteriors of architectural heritage with low cost and high efficiency. The method takes advantage of the emerging High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDRI) technology, which can store rich information about colour and illumination through digital photography. The significance of this research lies in that by recording the colour information, in addition to the geometry and texture information that can be obtained through other technologies, we can achieve more complete documentation for architectural heritage. In this paper, we present an overview of the problem and our effort of utilizing the advances in computer vision to document the colour information of architectural heritage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection of essays emerged from the research projects that 24 NEH Scholars developed during the NEH Summer Institute "Leonardo da Vinci: Between Art and Science" (Florence, Italy, June-July 2012), hosted bythe Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz (KHI).&amp;#x0D; Over a period of three weeks, NEH Scholars explored the relations between art and science in the works of Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), the versatile, canonical artist of western art who moved with equal ease among artistic, literary, intellectual and scientific circles.&amp;#x0D; The Institute was organized around three major themes:&amp;#x0D; ¦ Word and Image&amp;#x0D; ¦ Painting and Drawing&amp;#x0D; ¦ Craftsmen and Scholars&amp;#x0D; Selected to address cogent issues in the study of Leonardo's works and writings, these three themes are more generally significant to understand the relations between art and science in the early modern period.&amp;#x0D; Within these three themes, NEH Scholars developed their individual research projects and the essays gathered here are the first outcomes of those projects.&amp;#x0D; The essays vary greatly in themes and approaches, reflecting the diverse background, training and interests of their authors. They all provide unique points of entry into the many aspects of Leonardo da Vinci's works and writings and suggest possible use of new materials for undergraduate teaching and scholarly research.&amp;#x0D; This website includes also additional bibliographical resources and the program of the NEH Institute.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The focus of Making Modernism is the literature of Chicago in connection with the unique urban, economic, and cultural history of the city. Chicago's contributions to international modernism have predominantly focused on architecture, which we acknowledge with a design derived from the windows of Frank Lloyd Wright. This exhibit, however, gives emphasis to the literature of Chicago and its connections to developments across the arts.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Making Modernism emphasizes four thematic lines of inquiry relating to twentieth-century Chicago's literary and cultural life: (1) the geographic centrality of Chicago both locally and internationally; (2) modernism's distinctive reception history in Chicago; (3) the historically overlooked women in Chicago who served as important cultural arbiters; and (4) the connections between the "Chicago Renaissance" in the arts, which occurred between 1910 and the mid-1920s, and the "Chicago Black Renaissance," which began in the 1930s and continued through mid-century.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>What is the value of a liberal arts education? Many students considering college may be asking themselves this question. One of the main goals of this website is to provide resources to students that will help them to think through this question and come to their own conclusion about it. A second goal of this website is to serve as a resource for faculty members who are interested in teaching a course on the liberal arts. While many faculty members have developed an expertise in the liberal arts, the humanities, or the sciences, often enough they have not taught a course on the value and meaning of a liberal education itself. On this website, faculty will find a variety of different resources that may help them design and teach their own course on the value of a liberal arts education.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>This site proceeds from "Early Modern Digital Agendas" (EMDA), an NEH-funded institute offered by the Folger Shakespeare Library in July 2013. Our aim is to draw attention to what is fragmented, ephemeral and lost in digital approaches to the early modern period. Digital tools tend to give an impression of completeness, promising a new horizon of quantification and preservation. We proceed from the idea that, if digitization is the tip of the iceberg, the ice melted long ago.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article initially grew out of Ian Gadd's presentation to the Folger Institute's Early Modern Digital Agendas (2013) institute. The primary authors, Erica Zimmer and Meaghan Brown, argue that understanding the development, current use, and limitations of EEBO allows students and scholars to fully consider the source of their information and the limits of this digital tool. This essay covers the scope of EEBO, its uses and limitations, as well as pedagogical considerations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article on the history of EEBO grew from discussions in the Folger Institute's 2012 Workshop on Teaching Book History and the summer 2013 Early Modern Digital Agendas seminar (EMDA2013). The latter was an NEH-ODH Institute in Advanced Topics. At EMDA2013, visiting faculty member Ian Gadd led participants through a two-day investigation of EEBO. Members of EMDA argue that understanding the development, current use, and limitations of EEBO allows scholars to fully consider the influence of the digital tool on our understanding of early modern texts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This blog will look at one of the most important periods in Thomas Jefferson's life, during which he wrote and published one of the most important books in American history: Notes on the State of Virginia. The year 2015 is the 230th anniversary of its first private printing in Paris; the 230th anniversary of its formal publication will take place in 2017. I intend to prepare the first annotated edition of Notes made from Jefferson's original manuscript.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project is dedicated to the study of the Sara-Bagirmi languages, a group of the Central Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan languages. They are spoken principally in Chad and northern Central African Republic. A outline of current information about the languages' geographical location, distribution, numbers of speakers, and classification can be found with SIL's Ethnologue. It is often difficult to find all the sources for these languages, and one is constantly coming across unpublished works -- student theses, missionary works, etc -- for which it is difficult to find a published reference.  All languages will be additionally identified by their Ethnologue tag, indicated by square brackets. For example, the Bagirmi language is tagged as [bmi].  </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Encyclopaedia Iranica, as an online resource available (gratis) at www.iranicaonline.org, represents a vast fund of searchable information, where coverage of subjects can continue to be updated, expanded, and enriched. Since it covers Iranian influences and interactions over a wide range of time and space, it inevitably addresses many topics that are pertinent, not only to the modern states of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, but to the Central Asian republics, the Caucasian republics, Iraq and Turkey,  India and Pakistan.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>African Origins contains information about the migration histories of Africans forcibly carried on slave ships into the Atlantic. Using the personal details of 91,491 Africans liberated by International Courts of Mixed Commission and British Vice Admiralty Courts, this resource makes possible new geographic, ethnic, and linguistic data on peoples captured in Africa and pulled into the slave trade. Through contributions to this website by Africans, members of the African Diaspora, and others, we hope to set in motion the rediscovery of the backgrounds of the millions of Africans captured and sold into slavery during suppression of transatlantic slave trading in the 19th century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The GHI supports a range of programs at Montgomery, including course revisions, international partnerships, conferences, and public programs that address the humanities in a global context. One of the most significant projects so far has been the creation of a fellowship program in which faculty undertake a year of intensive study leading to the redesign or creation of new globally focused humanities courses. Through this more intentional focus on global issues and influences, the college hopes to create a curriculum and cocurriculum that better serves the diverse student body, says Rita Kranidis, director of the GHI. "We're creating a pedagogy that integrates the global perspectives students bring into the classroom, and also meets the needs of American students."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>MARKUS is a semi-automatic markup platform that is designed to automate the markup process of specific types of named entities (personal names, place names, temporal references, and official titles) in classical Chinese. Users can also tag their texts automatically by uploading their own lists of words or regular expressions, as well as edit or add any markup manually after the automatic markup process. A range of online reference tools have been integrated in the platform. Users can consult these reference sources while reading texts or verifying markup. The final results can be exported into tabular format for further statistical, temporal, spatial, and social network analysis.</Abstract>

		<SecondaryURLDescription>The publication of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary: A Multispectral Critical Edition reveals for the first time the original record of a remarkable and traumatic period in the life of David Livingstone, the celebrated British abolitionist, missionary, and explorer of Africa. The date of publication coincides almost exactly with the date Livingstone completed this diary in Central Africa 140 years ago. The original, previously unpublished text of the diary has remained inaccessible until now, due to the fragility of the paper and the near-illegible script. The David Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project has restored the full text of the diary by using spectral imaging and processing technology to make the diary available through this electronic edition. </SecondaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>This "Finding Aid" for the records of the M. Knoedler &amp;amp; Co. archive is now publically available online for research. As a result of this NEH: HCRR grant, the finding aid was enhanced with series level biographical, scope, and content notes. As stated in the published finding aid abstract, the records of M. Knoedler &amp;amp; Co. document the business of one of the most important American art dealers over more than a century (1848-1971), and trace the development of the once provincial American art market into one of the world's leading art centers. The archive includes stock books, sales books and commission books; extensive correspondence with artists, collectors and other art dealers; photographs of the artworks sold by the gallery; business records from affiliate offices in Paris and London; department records; and research files, catalogs and ephemera. Currently the stock books, sales books, commission books, inventory cards, shipment records, and general correspondence are available for research. The remainder of the archive is still being processed—each series will be made available for use as processing is completed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thousands of videos from the Fox Movietone News Collection available for free, streaming access online. About the Fox Movietone collection: The collection contains seven million feet of nitrate motion picture film and four million feet of safety motion picture film documenting the national and global politics and culture from 1919 through 1934 and from September 1942 through August 1944. Paper holdings provide detailed notes generated by original camera crews as well as ephemera related to individual stories. Within the collection are elements from two distinct newsreel products. One is a silent newsreel, Fox News, which ran from 1919 into 1930. The other is the original sound newsreel, Fox Movietone News, which ran from 1927 through 1963. The majority of films in the collection were not used by the Fox corporation as part of a released newsreel. The collection does contain over 200 released newsreels from 1942 to 1944.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Atlanta, originally named Terminus, has a profound history which is extensively intertwined with transit. This project visualizes how the city's public transit system, now a shadow of what it once was, falls short of its far-reaching intentions. By highlighting the routes which have been proposed in the development of these systems, this project aims to contribute to larger discussions taking place around the topic of public transit in Atlanta. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This story map was created by a team of Student Innovation Fellows at Georgia State University (GSU) working within the University Library's Collaborative University Research and Visualization Environment (CURVE) during the 2014-2015 academic year.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The goal of Shakespeare, Editor is to deploy digital and traditional analytical methods to visualize the "hand" of William Shakespeare in a selection of works to which he contributed so as to better grasp his role as collaborator and editor. Primary among is Robert Chester's 1601 multi-author pamphlet, Love's Martyr, a singular collection containing poems by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, George Chapman, and John Marston as well as Robert Chester, the traditionally assumed editor of this volume, to whom only this printed work has been attributed. The hypothesis behind this study, which mines and visualizes Love's Martyr's authorial boundaries using the NEH-funded Lexos suite and other stylometric applications, is that portions of text attributed to Chester within Love's Martyr indicate stylistically significant departures from work signed by him here and in manuscript. Moreover, as findings suggest, these sections of text align stylistically and technically far more with Shakespeare's poetry than with the work of either Chester or the other authors who contributed to the volume.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Located in western Anatolia on a major route connecting the Aegean with inland Turkey and built on a naturally defensible citadel by the banks of a river with golden sands, Sardis was blessed with many natural advantages. The city became the capital of the Lydian empire in the seventh and sixth centuries BC, when a dynasty of kings from Gyges to Croesus conquered western Anatolia, invented the world's first coins, and concluded treaties with the great civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. Under the Achaemenid Persians (547 - 334 BC), Sardis was the capital of a major satrapy (province) of Asia Minor, and the mustering-point for the invasions of Greece under the Great Kings Darius and Xerxes. &amp;#x0D; The newly developed website provides much information on the site in English and Turkish and offers full electronic access to publications and finds.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Welcome&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Scholars' Dashboard project was a series of three two-day workshops, teaming humanities scholars, librarians, and technologists in innovative application development to optimize use of humanities collections from the OhioLINK Digital Resource Commons (DRC). The DRC was a 500,000 item open access collection from Ohio academic and cultural heritage organizations. Workshops allowed researchers and scholars to specify features needed to rapidly expand DRC functionality. This model will then be used as a magnet for further digital humanities collections, as scholars, librarians, and archivists contribute collections in order to benefit from the Scholars' Dashboard design and capabilities.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The workshop produced technical requirements for a Scholar's Dashboard.  These should be considered for any online digital humanities repository.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What Is Racial Difference? is a blog for asking what race consists of: is it color? culture? geography? This is a site for asking what race does: does it produce division and strife? define and maintain communities? create and uphold structures of inequality? provide a platform for passing down rituals and values? This is a site for examining how race functions in daily life: does race affect a person's perception of herself? her educational decisions? his professional performance, whether positively or negatively? This is a site for reflecting on where race operates: is race with us at the grocery store? at the academic conference?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Contributors include students in Professor Cord Whitaker's What Is Racial Difference? [English 291] at Wellesley College and professional scholars who think about race from a variety of disciplinary perspectives: English, French, Spanish, History, Biology, Genetics, Psychology, Anthropology, Political Science, etc.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; To answer ‘What is race?' is to deal with a vast and varied array of evidence and a variety of analytical approaches that varies even more. This blog's objective is to bring evidence and approaches—especially those that may be less well known—to light and into conversation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A digital version of the critically edited collection of essays, entitled Interpretations of Poetry and Religion, that first takes up topics Santayana continued to explore throughout his career. Published in 1900, the book already exhibited Santayana's lifelong concerns with consciousness and its interpretation of material existence and the resulting poetic and religious expressions of human experience. Because it is critically edited, this text is superior to other electronic versions available on the internet, which contain typographical and editorial errors that detract from the author's original intention.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When George Santayana wrote The Sense of Beauty, he had the benefit of consulting notes taken by a former student who had attended Santayana aesthetics lectures. Horatius Bonar Hastings, who graduated from Harvard University with an A.M. in 1893, was a student in Santayana's 1892–93 aesthetics class. Santayana wrote to Hastings: "Mr. Henshaw showed me yesterday the very careful and full notes you took in Phil. 8. Might I borrow them long enough to have them copied? They will be very useful to me as they are much more full than the brief headings from which I lectured. I am thinking of publishing a little book based on these discussions, so that your notes will be invaluable to me" ("To Horatius Bonar Hastings, 14 April 1893", LGS, 1:127). The notes are presented here electronically in both facsimile and transcribed formats.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The archaeological site of Inca-Caranqui is located near the foot of Mt. Imbabura in the northern highlands of Ecuador. Situated at the very northern edge of Tawantinsuyu, Inca-Caranqui likely represents the last major imperial building event prior to the Spanish invasion. The Inca-Caranqui Archaeological Project was designed to investigate the role of this site within the larger imperial agenda as well as how it figured in the context of the local political landscape. The archaeological research conducted at Inca-Caranqui over the past several years offers new insights into the origins, nature and affiliation of this site; Inca strategies of statecraft during the "mature" phase of empire; and the ways in which imperial state installations communicated and compelled new systems of order in the distant provinces.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In late 2006, the local historic preservation organization known as FONSALCI (Fondo de Salvamento de Patrimonio Cultural, Cantón Ibarra) undertook exploratory excavations and cleaning operations on a recently acquired municipal lot in the parroquia of Caranqui. Situated on the lower northern slopes of Mt. Imbabura, Caranqui has long been recognized as the "centro antiguo" of the city of Ibarra by local residents. Numerous large earthen mounds or tolas dating to the late precolumbian period (AD 1200–1500), which once served as platforms for the construction of chiefly residences (Athens 1980; Oberem 1981), are known to have been clustered in this zone. Also preserved in Caranqui, directly across from the parish church, are two standing stone walls with multiple doors and niches that form part of a large rectangular Inca building (Bedoya 1990; Almeida 1995:44–46). The size of this building and its construction features suggest that it likely represents an Inca kallanka or great hall. The western edge of the lot acquired by FONSALCI in 2006 is situated approximately 50 meters to the northeast of this Inca building.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While Lessing made numerous contributions to aesthetic theory in his lifetime, the text that most cogently and comprehensively documents his dramatic theory—and the text that has had the greatest historical and intellectual influence on the practice and theory of theater—is the Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie, 1767-1769). This  collection of 101 short essays represents one of the first sustained critical engagements with the potential of theater as a vehicle for the advancement of humanistic discourse. Our translation is the first complete and annotated translation into English of this key text in theater history.</Abstract>

This website hosts the peer-to-peer review draft of the first complete, annotated English translation of G. E. Lessing's Hamburg Dramaturgy, translated by Wendy Arons and Sara Figal, and edited by Natalya Baldyga. The project is currently under contract with Routledge Press, which has allowed us to prepublish our work online for open review. The draft manuscript with comments will remain online even after the translation has been published. The published book will incorporate comments and suggestions made on the website into the final version of the annotated translation, and it will be enhanced by the addition of critical introductions contributed by Wendy Arons, Natalya Baldyga, and Michael Chemers.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>The Charles Brockden Brown Electronic Archive and Scholarly Edition builds on, supplements, and contextualizes the Bicentennial Edition of The Novels and Related Works, published between 1977 and 1987 under the general editorship of Sydney J. Krause and S. W. Reid. This consisted of six volumes containing the novels Wieland (1977), Arthur Mervyn (1980), Ormond (1983), Edgar Huntly (1984), Clara Howard and Jane Talbot (1986), and the dialogue Alcuin (1987). The Charles Brockden Brown Electronic Archive and Scholarly Edition also aims to identify, transcribe, organize, and ultimately edit Brown's uncollected writings, making them searchable in an electronic environment. Access to these texts will cast new light on Brown as a novelist, editor, and historian, revise his stature among the intellectuals of the new republic, and enhance our understanding of authorship and the dynamics of print culture in his day.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>LOGAR is a geographical index and map of places relevant to Andean studies. It focuses initially on the towns established during the mass colonial resettlement program known as the Reducción General de Indios (General Resettlement of Indians) of the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo. The Reducción forcibly resettled approximately 1.4 million native Andeans into over 1,000 reducción (literally, "reduction") towns. Reducciones were founded (at least nominally) during the Visita General (Toledo's tour of inspection and resettlement) between 1570 and 1575. The scope of LOGAR is initially limited to the area under most direct jurisdictional control of Viceroy Toledo—specifically, the audiencias of Lima and Charcas. LOGAR will be continuously updated by edited contributions by scholars of Andean history in various countries, who have expressed interest in having a tool and repository such as LOGAR.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Most Southern" portfolios are developed annually by undergraduate students from University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Duke University who are part of the Robertson Scholars Leadership Program. The students are assigned to The Delta Center for Culture and Learning via the Community Summer component of the program. Community Summer is designed to increase the Robertson Scholars' awareness of the social and economic challenges of the Mississippi Delta. Their direct involvement with developing the portfolios represents a quite valuable educational partnership and service learning experience. The portfolios allow the Robertson Scholars to acquire and apply expertise in project management, team management, photography, and report writing. The portfolios also serve as an educational resource and programmatic reference for past, current, and aspiring workshop participants, as well as NEH Landmarks Program staff.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This website was created to disseminate information on the NEH-sponsored "Bridging Cultures" partnership project of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Russian and East European Studies (REES) and the Community College of Beaver County (CCBC). The site includes freely downloadable course modules that were developed by CCBC faculty participants to incorporate content on East European cultures into classes across multiple disciplines, along with reflections written by these faculty members about the impact of their participation in the project. In addition, the site provides videos of several faculty development discussions held at CCBC in 2015-16 through the "Bridging Cultures" project, including videoconferences with REES's East European partner institutions and guest lecturers. These resources are intended to assist faculty from other community colleges who seek to internationalize their curricula.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>SEVENTEEN MOMENTS IN SOVIET HISTORY is a multi-media archive of primary materials designed to introduce students and the general public to the richness and contradictions of Soviet history. It provides a cross-section of Soviet life in seventeen different years, following the title of a beloved television spy serial from the seventies. Each module covers politics, society, culture and economics, so that users might experience a given time through the words, sounds and sights that a common Soviet citizen would have encountered. We hope the materials presented here help students understand the more complicated truth about Soviet history — that at all times life in the Soviet Union offered experiences of great good and great evil. Soviet citizens lived their lives and made their country's history in circumstances of incredible peril as well as promise. The objective of this web site is to give users a sense of what this total experience was like, using the original words of the participants.  THE ARCHIVE MAY BE ACCESSED BY YEAR OR BY THEME. Subject essays written by a contributing scholar provide brief  introductions to over 200 subjects.  These essays are supported by more than 1400 images,  270 video clips,  music with translated lyrics, and over 600 primary texts, as well as links to relevant materials outside the website.   The Glossary tab features a list of historical terms and abbreviations, and the Personages tab provides dates, photos and basic biographical information for over 600 people in Soviet history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A website containing online exhibitions produced by my seminar "What is a copy?" taught in the Fall 2015 at Tulane University. Students collected metadata, built records and curated online exhibitions of copies found in their rooms, encountered in readings and in their own research. The exhibitions incorporate reflections on readings done in the seminar and each student was responsible for populating and building an online exhibition on a copy or a copying practice for their final project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This website offers a bibliography as a service to scholars, students, and general readers.  It is a companion site to the conference American Civil Wars: The Entangled Histories of the United States, Latin America, and Europe in the 1860s.  This three-day conference, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, will be held March 19-21, 2014 at the University of South Carolina and will bring together leading historians from the US, Latin America, and Europe to reexamine the hitherto disconnected histories of the rebellions, civil wars, conquest, and emancipations that shook the Americas and Europe.  The bibliography will highlight scholarship on the interconnected, transnational linkages that fueled these events, formed their trajectories, and followed into their aftermaths.  This is an active project that will receive updates along with regional and thematic pages, and welcomes input from users/readers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presented here are a collaborative set of inquiries into the historical effects of a singular ancient Native American phenomenon--Cahokia. Our research seeks to understand (1) how the Cahokia that we can still see today came to be, some nine centuries ago, (2) how it changed the known human and nonhuman world of the Mississippi valley centuries ago, and (3) how it is relevant for our 21st century world.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>In 1990s-early 2000s, Principal Investigators Timothy Pauketat and Susan Alt began work in the Richland Complex, a Cahokia-related farming district in the upland hills east of Cahokia proper. Then, as now, the remains of the farming sites of people long past were under serious threat of destruction. Many were lost; more continue to be destroyed. Crews of students and volunteers excavated large portions of Cahokia-related farming settlements, a ritual-administrative complex, and a shrine complex. All of the remains from these excavations are currently under analysis, and are introduced here thanks to the financial support of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</PrimaryURLDescription>
		<SecondaryURL>http://www.cahokia.illinois.edu/richlandproject/index.html</SecondaryURL>
		<SecondaryURLDescription>This page introduces the NEH funded study examining the relationship between Cahokia’s dramatic mid-11th century CE construction as a monumental capital and its diverse, rapidly urbanizing population of immigrants and locals. The precise causal connections between immigrant farmers, climate change, and religion are being delineated using eight highly productive salvage-archaeological field excavations in the 1990s and early 2000s at four sites east of the American Indian city of Cahokia.</SecondaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Fernão Lopes (1380/90 - c.1460) was appointed royal chronicler in 1434 by King Duarte of Portugal (1391-1438).  Fernão Lopes is recognized as the father of Portuguese historiography. The magnitude of his work, his research methodology, the precision invested in registering complex events, the range of information and perspectives offered, combined with the deliberate narrative structure and techniques he adopted to fulfill his task, clearly mark him as one of the most interesting chroniclers of the late Middle Ages. The website is about him and his works.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is the role of the material world in shaping the tensions and paradoxes of imperial sovereignty? Scholars have long shed light on the complex processes of conquest, extraction, and colonialism under imperial rule. But imperialism has usually been cast as an exclusively human drama, one in which the world of matter does not play an active role. Lori Khatchadourian argues instead that things—from everyday objects to monumental buildings—profoundly shape social and political life under empire. Out of the archaeology of ancient Persia and the South Caucasus, Imperial Matter advances powerful new analytical approaches to the study of imperialism writ large and should be read by scholars working on empire across the humanities and social sciences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Citizenship Under Siege&amp;#x0D; "We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice. . ."  So begins the Preamble to the US Constitution.  But who is recognized as belonging to "We the People," not just legally with full rights and responsibilities, but also in terms of culture, language, and recognized identities?  And if granted citizenship by law, can one fully practice it if curtailed by economic inequality or by racism?  Who is entitled to be seen as an American citizen is still entangled with issues of social justice, race, religious belief, property, wealth, national origins, gender, language, and ethnicity.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In an age of fractious differences about this topic when finding common ground seems elusive, The Association of American Colleges and Universities and The Democracy Commitment are joining with seven community colleges to orchestrate a series of public forums, each with accompanying programs and educational resources to bridge the rifts.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Organized under the common theme, Citizenship Under Siege and supported by a grant from The National Endowment for the Humanities, the events are framed through the powerful historic, ethical, and narrative lenses of the humanities.  We believe this tapestry of forums underscores how the humanities still are "the heart of the matter, the keeper of the republic—a source of national memory and civic vigor, cultural understanding and communication, individual fulfillment, and the ideals we hold in common" (American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences, 2013, 9).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Clashes Over Citizenship: Webinar Series on Promoting Listening, Learning, and Engagement&amp;#x0D; The US Constitution's preamble speaks of "We the People"—but who is considered part of that sacred circle, and how has this group varied over time? When national identity is hotly contested, what does it mean to experience citizenship as partial, denied, or fully acknowledged? How can the humanities illuminate differing narratives and open up space for understanding, connections, and shared visions of the future?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Association of American Colleges and Universities and The Democracy Commitment invite faculty, staff, students, and campus community partners to join in one or all of three FREE webinars. These events are designed to expand campus expertise on how to hold constructive conversations about contentious issues and how to institute practices in and out of the classroom that foster engagement across differences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Located in the Northern Rocky Mountains at the center of the largest wilderness complex in the lower 48, the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness is iconic in the wilderness preservation system. Although human beings have been steadily interacting with the land that now comprises the Selway-Bitterroot since prehistory, the human impact on the area is negligible compared to other wild lands in the U.S. Why? What kinds of people chose this area as their home? What kinds of decisions did they make about living on the land? What kinds of laws did they establish and why? What "accidents" of history made human impact in the Selway-Bitterroot so low? How did the rigors of the land itself aid in the preservation process? Answering such questions is vital to an understanding not only of the Selway-Bitterroot, but also of wilderness areas more broadly, at a time when U.S. citizens throughout the country struggle with the question of how best to interact with and manage wild lands, which arguably, are among our most important national resources. The project uses podcasts of oral history interviews, historical documents, and photographs, to help answer these questions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>History of Between the Waters - Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and Humanities South Carolina, Between the Waters is a production of South Carolina ETV. The first project about Hobcaw Barony produced by SCETV was a television documentary entitled The Baruchs of Hobcaw, which was broadcast in 2012. This hour-long program left the producers with the desire to find a way to explore the complex story of Hobcaw Barony more deeply and interactively. Intrigued by the idea of applying immersive transmedia techniques and formats to history, they began development of a prototype of Between the Waters.

		<Abstract>On February 4, 2017, the Westborough Public Library asked Westborough residents to bring in historical and cultural items relating to our town for the library to scan and digitize at its "Westborough: Your Town - Your History" Scanning Day. People brought in photographs, documents, uniforms, posters, and other items from their homes that they thought captured the spirit of our town. After the library digitized these items, the people went home with their possessions, digital copies of them, and advice on how to store and preserve their valuable historical objects.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This exhibit highlights the major themes that emerged from this special day.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Marzamemi Maritime Heritage Project is a collaborative excavation, survey, and heritage management initiative focusing on the maritime landscape and seaborne communication off the southeast coast of Sicily, Italy. The concentration of accessible sites and their location at the intersection of the eastern and western Mediterranean facilitates inquiry into long-term structures of regional and interregional maritime exchange from the early Roman era (3rd/2nd c. BC) through Late Antiquity (6th/7th c. AD). The first field seasons undertake the excavation of the so-called Marzamemi "church wreck", which sank while carrying prefabricated architectural elements for the construction of an early Byzantine church alongside other cargo from the northern Aegean during the 6th c. AD. This ship's cargo, personal items, and hull remains may offer unique insights into the relationship between state-driven and independent commerce as well as the ambitious reconstruction program integral to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian's projection of imperial ideology across his realm. Equally important to this research, the project situates fieldwork within a broader dialog on responsible collaborative natural and cultural heritage practices. We aim to utilize community archaeology and public outreach to implement site management alongside local initiatives for environmentally sustainable tourism and economic development.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Mark Twain Papers contain the voluminous private papers of Samuel Langhorne Clemens (Mark Twain).  Before his death in 1910, Clemens passed these documents to his official biographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, who published sparingly from them until his death in 1937. Several successive editors served as literary executors for Clemens's estate and custodians of the Papers, which became part of The Bancroft Library in 1971.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>All landscapes, because they have been moulded by human action, are to some extent political. This is particularly evident in the Mediterranean Basin, a crossroad where civilisations have coalesced and often clashed. Although the larger of the Mediterranean Islands have been the home centres of great civilisations (Chapters 3 and 5) during prehistoric times, they have been unable to resist the repeated invasions of mainland-based powers that battled successively for political and commercial authority.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>No event in American history matches the drama of emancipation. More than a century later, it continues to stir the deepest emotions, and properly so. In the United States, emancipation accompanied the defeat of the world's most powerful slaveholding class and freed a larger number of slaves than did the end of slavery in all other New World societies combined. Clothed in the rhetoric of biblical prophecy and national destiny and born of a bloody civil war, it accomplished a profound social revolution. The Freedmen and Southern Society Project was established in 1976 to capture the essence of that revolution by depicting the drama of emancipation in the words of the participants: liberated slaves and defeated slaveholders, soldiers and civilians, common folk and the elite, Northerners and Southerners</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Selected Papers of John Jay is an ongoing endeavor by scholars at Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library to organize, transcribe and publish a wide range of politically and culturally important letters authored by and written to American Founding Father John Jay that demonstrate the depth and breadth of Jay's contributions as a nation builder. More than 13,000 documents from over 75 university and historical collections have been compiled and photographed to date. Printed volumes illustrate Jay's roles as a patriot, jurist, diplomat, peacemaker and governor. Of seven planned chronological letterpress volumes, four books have been completed and span the years 1760 - 1788; three more volumes are scheduled for release dates of 2017, 2019 and 2020. An online, indexed database of the letters in these volumes and more was first launched in 2003. The papers also shed light on the lives of other key Founding Fathers like Washington, Adams, Franklin, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton.[1]</Abstract>

		<Abstract>DigitalDonne constitutes volume 1 of The Variorum Edition of the Poetry of John Donne (8 vols. in 11 parts, Indiana UP, 1995-), a collaborative edition drawing on the labors of over 30 scholars from the United States and abroad.  This website provides information about the edition's history, materials, procedures, and personnel, as well as access to a substantial arsenal of Scholarly Tools and Resources for the further study of Donne (in particular) and other Renaissance writers.  Included are first-line indexes of major editions and manuscripts; a comprehensive Excel data base listing headings, first lines, and bibliographical details of all appearances of Donne poems in seventeenth-century artifacts; an archive of downloadable transcriptions of source texts; collation and transcription software; various cross-reference and finding lists; a gallery of manuscript images exhibiting the hands of 195 seventeenth-century scribes who copied one or more Donne poems; and a comprehensive electronic concordance to Donne's poems. Also present are PDF versions of the first three of John R. Roberts's annotated bibliographies of modern Donne criticism (which cover the years 1912 to 1995); and—as an original online publication—the fourth volume in Roberts's series, John Donne: An Annotated Bibliography of Modern Criticism 1996–2012. A significant recent innovation, which provides virtual access to the most important of the early editions and manuscripts upon which the Variorum is based, is a collection of Digital Facsimile Editions. In addition to Donne's holograph verse letter to the Lady Carey, this collection includes the 1633, 1635, and 1669 editions of Donne's collected Poems, as well as the St. Paul's, the Westmoreland, the O'Flahertie, and the Dolaucothi manuscripts. Editions of the Dublin I and the Cambridge Balam manuscripts of Donne's poetry are in progress, and a uniquely annotated copy of the 1654 Letters to Severall Persons of Honour is also presented.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Huon d'Auvergne Digital Archive is a collaborative scholarly project that presents for the first time to a modern reading audience the Franco-Italian Huon d'Auvergne romance epic. The first phase of the project (January 1, 2014 - August 31, 2017), funded by the generosity of the National Endowment for the Humanities, develops the first version of the Huon digital archive, which includes diplomatic editions of all four extant manuscripts, an accompanying English translation, and a reading interface that demonstrates protocols for textual analysis and comparison of variants. From the initial foundation of phase one, the Huon editorial team will build additional functionality involving high-resolution scans of the four Franco-Italian manuscripts, creating an interactive and linked reading environment. It is our hope that the results of phase one will already be useful to researchers, teachers, and students of medieval epic. A technical report of the project can be found on our GitHub repository.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Center for the Humanities at Washington University in St. Louis, in collaboration with stakeholders both within and outside of the traditional humanities disciplines, was awarded an NEH Next Generation Humanities PhD planning grant during AY 2016-17 in order to plan for a full reconceptualization of doctoral training in the humanities at our institution.  Our project, titled "Cohorts, Courses, Qualifications, and Careers: Reconceptualizing the Humanities PhD at Washington University," brought together faculty, administrators, current graduate students and alumni in four working groups, each meeting monthly to address challenges that impact the successive stages of humanities PhD training, from the constitution of incoming cohorts through academic coursework and ABD training/internships through career advising and post-dissertation placement. We also invited four outside consultants from peer institutions, who met with a range of stakeholders both inside and outside the working groups. The white paper we published at the conclusion of our planning period identifies some of the action items that emerged from this work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is the project website for "The New PhD: A Renaissance of Public Engagement." Although the project has officially ended, this website continues to serve as a repository of the goals and ideas generated by the project's planning committees.  The Graduate Center of the City University of New York was awarded a Next Generation Humanities Ph.D. Planning Grant by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) for the 2016-2017 academic year. Planning activities at the Graduate Center encompassed three planning themes:      curriculum: ways to integrate multiple career outcomes early on in students' experience in graduate school;     data: collecting and publicly disseminating data about retention rates and student post-doctoral career paths; and     partnerships: initiation of partnerships with non-academic institutions.  During the course of the grant, our planning committees met regularly to discuss desired changes for the Graduate Center and the implementation of those changes. Following each meeting, key ideas were documented on our project reports page.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This exhibit makes The Chinese Colony in Peru, a community album published by in 1924, accessible to readers and also provides a reading of the album as a snapshot of a translocal Cantonese Peruvian ecumene. This translocal reading suggests ways of conceptualizing the history of Asians in the Americas and ways of engaging with questions of traffics, territories and modes of belonging (i.e. citizenship) that do not default into methodological nationalism. Rather, it suggests a way to take the social, cultural and geographic complexity of migrant worlds as both the point of departure and the end goal in the conceptualization of those histories. By shifting the analytic lens away from a focus on the album's narrative of integration, traces of this translocal world become more visible. When read critically as a snapshot of a bigger Cantonese Peruvian ecumene, the album offers a glimpse into the social, physical and imagined geographical contours of this particular translocal migrant world that is all too easily eclipsed by the consolidation of bordered and settler nation states during the long 19th century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The armed conflict in the east of Ukraine brought about an emergence of a distinctive trend in contemporary Ukrainian poetry: the poetry of war. Directly and indirectly, the poems collected in this volume engage with the events and experiences of war, reflecting on the themes of alienation, loss, dislocation, and disability; as well as justice, heroism, courage, resilience, generosity, and forgiveness. In addressing these themes, the poems also raise questions about art, politics, citizenship, and moral responsibility. The anthology brings together some of the most compelling poetic voices from different regions of Ukraine. Young and old, female and male, somber and ironic, tragic and playful, filled with extraordinary terror and ordinary human delights, the voices recreate the human sounds of war in its tragic complexity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Nasher Museum presented a multi-media exhibition that brought to life the city of Venice through Jacopo de' Barbari's iconic View. Printed in 1500, this mural-sized woodcut portrays a bird's eye view of the city that was instantly recognized as a technological and artistic masterpiece, a portrait of an urban marvel. No other city view rivaled its grandeur, ambition, or detail. With staggering precision, the View of Venice visually describes the dense fabric of the city—thousands of buildings, hundreds of bridges, and a complex network of islands, canals, narrow streets, squares, and wellheads. The original print was on loan from the Minneapolis Institute of Art for this exhibition. For the first time, this exhibition animated the View of Venice with interactive displays that told stories of one of the wealthiest, most powerful and greatly admired cities in the early modern world. Touchscreens revealed the production of this extraordinary print as well as the historical and social themes that emerge from the image: the celebrated uniqueness of Venice, detailed city views, women and men, the state, religious life, collections and lost treasures. An augmented reality highlights the stunning continuities and remarkable transformations to the city in the more than 500 years following the View's publication in Venice. This exhibition was curated by Kristin L. Huffman, Instructor of Art History in Duke University's Department of Art, Art History &amp;amp; Visual Studies. The project, part of the Visualizing Venice initiative, is the result of multi-disciplinary and collaborative research developed over three years in the Wired! Lab at Duke.</Abstract>

Born in 1878, George Michael Cohan joined his parents' vaudeville act in infancy. His first full-length production opened on Broadway when he was just 23, and for the next 40 years he wrote, composed, directed, produced, or starred in over 100 Broadway productions. Thanks to a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for Humanities Collections and Reference Resources, the Museum is engaged in digitizing over 70 of Cohan's plays, musicals, and sketches, which will be made publicly available for the first time on the Collections Portal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Iowa Museum Association is building a community of practice around teaching Iowa history with primary sources held in public collections in support of Iowa Social Studies Standards.  There are two key components of the project, both of which will continue to grow and develop. Component 1 is a database of primary sources submitted by over 60 (as of August 2018) Iowa museums, historical societies, and archives.  These institutions have contributed images of objects, art, documents, etc., from their collections, resulting in a database of over 650 primary sources associated with Iowa history.  Submitted primary sources are cataloged and tagged in multiple ways, augmented with additional research, and made available to project partners for use in the development of lesson plans.  The database of cataloged primary sources is live online.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1838 Thomas Mulledy, S.J. signed his name to an agreement selling the 275 enslaved persons who resided on Jesuit-owned estates in Southern Maryland to Louisiana. The sale served as the culmination of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus's fraught experience with slaveholding in the colonial and early national period. While much historical work has been written on Jesuit slaveholding, that writing has primarily focused on the implications for the religious community and the moral universe in which these men made their decisions about slavery. Thus far, however, no scholar has studied the enslaved people themselves.  This project focuses on the lives and experiences of the enslaved, rather than on their Jesuit owners. Focusing on the enslaved community itself makes this project ideally suited for digital methods. With an eye to the events and relationships that formed the warp and woof of the daily lives of this enslaved community, Sharon Leon has identified the individual enslaved people present in the documentary evidence beginning in the 1740s and situated them within their families and larger community. The source base for this work consists of a number of collections related to the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, which are housed at the Booth Family Center for Special Collections at Georgetown University. Many of the key documents are available through the Georgetown Slavery Archive.  In processing and representing this archival research, the project employs linked open data and social network analysis to assess the entire community of enslaved people and their relationships to one another across space and time. This approach allows for both a focus on the distinct individuality of each enslaved person and the ability to pull back to grasp the community in aggregate, noting trends and changes in their experiences and relationships during their time in Maryland.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection consists of administrative records that were held by the Amerikan Bord Heyeti (ABH), which was the Turkish office of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), at its headquarters in Istanbul. It comprises correspondence of the ABH's local financial officers and reports by staff, committees, and mission stations, which document the activities of stations, schools, medical facilities, publishing and evangelistic ventures in Anatolia and the Balkans, and also in Syria and other regions of the Middle East. ABCFM was a Protestant agency founded in the United States in 1810 to send missionaries abroad for religious and altruistic labor. Its first personnel arrived in Izmir in 1820, and up until 2010, when ABH closed permanently, ABCFM and its successors pursued education, health, and publishing work in Turkey and the surrounding regions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Around three quarters of a million people applied to be American Citizens in 2017. But what does citizenship actually mean? The way Americans have defined citizenship has changed over time and many have found their citizenship challenged, undermined, resisted and even revoked. On this episode of BackStory, Brian, Nathan and Joanne discover the path to citizenship has never been easy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Google the phrase "divided America" and you'll find numerous, stories, opinion pieces and even psychological theories on why we're so disconnected. From race and class to gender and politics, it seems that Americans can't see eye-to-eye – to the point that a recent NBC News headline stated, "Americans are divided over everything except division." On this episode, Ed, Nathan and Joanne look at other times in history when Americans were split.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Chicago 1919: Confronting the Race Riots" is a year-long initiative to heighten the 1919 Chicago race riots in the city's collective memory, engaging Chicagoans in public conversations about the legacy of the most violent week in Chicago history. Funded by a National Endowment for the Humanities "Community Conversations" grant, the project is being coordinated by the Newberry Library in partnership with 13 other Chicago institutions. At the heart of Chicago 1919 are 11 dynamic public programs designed to activate audiences and encourage them to examine the mechanisms through which segregation and inequality have been created, solidified, and reinforced over the past 100 years. Each program will focus on a specific expression of institutionalized racism, from policing and education to housing and the media. Chicago 1919 aims to address difficult history, to come together in recognition and reconciliation, and to imagine possible ways forward.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project compiles the available resources related to the impact and recovery process of libraries, archives, museums and other cultural institutions in Puerto Rico. It is not exhaustive, but, hopefully it will provide enough documentation for future generations to understand part of the recovery events that took place immediately after Hurricane Maria or at least inspire other projects that can help tell a more holistic story.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Two dollars in 1880 bought a yearlong subscription to the Southwestern Christian Advocate, a newspaper published in New Orleans by the Methodist Book Concern and distributed to nearly 500 preachers, 800 post offices, and more than four thousand subscribers in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The "Lost Friends" column, which ran from the paper's 1877 inception well into the first decade of the 20th century, featured messages from individuals searching for loved ones lost in slavery.   Begun in 2015, the database nearly doubled in size during the grant period. It traveled with the "Purchased Lives" exhibition (both object-based and panel versions). In its current form, the database provides access to 2,450 advertisements that appeared in the Advocate between November 1879 and November 1896. Digital reproductions of the Lost Friends advertisements are courtesy of Louisiana State University Libraries Special Collections, Hill Memorial Library.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A consortium of California State University (CSU) archives participated in the CSU Japanese American Digitization Project (CSUJAD) which was funded by a 2016 NEH Humanities Collections and Reference Resources (HCRR) Implementation grant to digitize textual documents, images, and oral histories that shed light on the removal of 120,000 law-abiding U.S. residents of Japanese descent during World War II. In the end, 4,500+ records were cataloged using the NEH funding. Initial funding from NEH has led to other grant support, which has resulted in over 33,000 records being added to CSUJAD to date.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project aims to preserve, publish, and promote understanding of the ancient cultural center of Salmon Pueblo and builds from the prior work of the Chaco Research Archive (http://www.chacoarchive.org). SPARC is the result of a collaboration between four institutions dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage: the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Archaeology Southwest, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, and the Salmon Ruins Museum. This resource allows users to search more than 140,500 records, including 13,006 photographs, 29,395 documents, and 24 data tables with information on particular artifact types, such as ceramic vessels, ornaments and bone tools. The records are from the comprehensive excavations of the Salmon Pueblo completed in the last 40 years and led by the late archaeologist Dr. Cynthia Irwin-Williams. Around 1090 AD, ancient Pueblo people built a large village on the north bank of the San Juan River near the modern city of Farmington, New Mexico. This three-story, 275-room pueblo was the first major colony established outside of Chaco Canyon. Chaco was an urban center 45 miles to the south, recognized today as UNESCO World Heritage Site and preserved as a National Park. These builders were the ancestors of contemporary Native Americans of the Southwest.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Who are the Hmong? There is a large presence of a little known Asian group of people called Hmong that reside in Catawba County and the surrounding counties of North Carolina. North Carolina is home to the fourth largest Hmong population in the United States. Hmong, a sub-ethnic group from Southeast Asia have lived in the United States since 1975, as refugees of the Vietnam War. Identifying the need to recognize and include this population as a part of the local history of Catawba County, the Catawba County Library in partnership with the Historical Association of Catawba County, applied for and received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to complete a preservation endeavor, known as Hmong Keeb Kwm — "keeb kwm" being the Hmong word that embodies history, tradition, and culture.  During the spring and summer of 2018, five collection events took place at the Catawba County Library branches and at True Life Alliance Church, a local Hmong assembly. There was an all-call for Hmong community members to bring their traditional artifacts, immigration documents, letters, photographs, and share their personal oral histories to be recorded. Collaborations were established with local Hmong organizations, such as Hmong Southeast Puavpheej, which helped in the success of the project. Culturally enriching programming such as a performing arts showcase, a panel discussion, and book discussions took place at the library. Through Hmong Keeb Kwm artifacts were collected from 16 participants, yielding over 145 digitized items, and 14 oral history recordings. All artifacts were returned to the original owners but a display of traditional artifacts that were donated to the Historical Association of Catawba County, can be found as part of the Unpacking exhibit, housed in the History Museum of Catawba County in Newton, North Carolina. The digital collection is made available online through a partnership with DigitalNC.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Hardworking actor, playwright, and stage manager Harry Watkins (1825–94) was aprolific diarist. For fifteen years (1845–60), Watkins regularly recorded theplays he saw, the roles he performed, the books he read, and his impressions ofcurrent events. Performing across the United States, Watkins collaborated withpreeminent performers and producers, recording his successes and failures as wellas his encounters with celebrities such as P. T. Barnum, Junius Brutus Booth,Edwin Forrest, Anna Cora Mowatt, and Lucy Stone. His is the only known diary ofsubstantial length and scope written by a U.S. actor before the Civil War—makingWatkins, essentially, the antebellum equivalent of Samuel Pepys.  This searchable digital edition includes the entire uncorrected text of Watkins's diary, encoded in XML, prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org). It is archived by the University of Michigan Library as a companion to the University of Michigan Press volume: A Player and a Gentleman: The Diary of Harry Watkins, Nineteenth-Century US American Actor, eds.

		<Abstract>As part of the National Endowment for the Humanities funded Hellenistic Royal Coinages project, Ptolemaic Coins Online (PCO) is a new research tool that will ultimately provide wide access to the coins listed in the print volumes of Coins of the Ptolemaic Empire by Catharine C. Lorber, the first attempt to provide a new, comprehensive standard typology and catalogue for the coinage produced by the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt since Ioannis Svoronos's ?a ??µ?sµata t?? ???t??? t?? ?t??eµa??? published in 1904–1908. The print volumes of Coins of the Ptolemaic Empire will eventually appear in four parts: Volume I appeared in 2018 covering the gold and silver coinage (Part I) and bronze coinage (Part II) of Ptolemy I (r. 323–282 BC) through Ptolemy IV (r. 221–204 BC). Volume II covering the gold and silver coinage (Part I) and bronze coinage (Part II) of Ptolemy V (r. 203–181 BC) through Cleopatra VII (r. 51–30 BC) is expected to appear in print by 2020. The current version of PCO, released in December 2018, covers the coinage found in Volume I, Part I of Coins of the Ptolemaic Empire; in early 2019 PCO will be updated to include the coins found in Volume I, Part II. Subsequent updates to PCO will occur when Volume II of Coins of the Ptolemaic Empire is released.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The book at the heart of this digital resource is a newly identified volume in the collection of the Newberry Library: Georg Rem's Inscriptiones picturae et emblemata quae in aula magna curiae Norimbergensis publice extant (VAULT Wing MS 279). The Inscriptiones is a hybrid book: it contains a printed copy of Rem's and Peter Isselburg's Emblemata Politica (1617), which depicts emblems from the Great Hall of the Nürnberg town hall, surrounded by pages of notes and descriptions written by Rem himself no later than 1620.   This digital resource is at the heart of this project. In this website, you will be able to explore Rem's unique manuscript and learn about the many stories it has to tell us about its creators, their interests, and the cultural forces that shaped their experience. "Emblematica Politica in Context" underscores the importance of funding long-term research, the synergies between research libraries and scholars, and the excitement for scholars, students, librarians, and research staff working across the disciplines of book history, Renaissance Studies, and digital humanities.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Richard Cross (1950–1983) began his career as a photographer at the Daily Globe in Worthington, Minnesota, where he worked until 1973. Cross spent four years (1974–1978) as a volunteer in Bogotá, Colombia, working as a photographer and audio-visual consultant for the Peace Corp’s Agricultural Communications program. Colombian anthropologist Nina de Friedemann invited him to join a project she had started in the early 1970s documenting what is considered the first Palenque (community of free Black slaves) in the Americas, Palenque de San Basilio, near Cartagena, Colombia. In 1979, he was drawn north to document the wars raging in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as well as the refugee crisis in Southern Mexico. There, Cross freelanced for major news outlets including U.S. News and World Report, Newsweek, and the Associated Press, and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his work in Nicaragua.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>The Kharaneh IV project explores the nature of interaction and aggregation at the end of the Pleistocene through the multi-component Early and Middle Epipalaeolithic site Kharaneh IV, Jordan. The high density of artifacts, repeated occupation, and the presence of multiple habitation structures suggests that Kharaneh IV was a hunter-gatherer aggregation site—a focal point on the landscape for community interaction. To address long-term changes and explore the nature of hunter-gatherer behavior at the cusp of agriculture, this project examines the high-resolution archaeological record of multi-season, prolonged, and repeated habitation of the region's largest and densest hunter-gatherer aggregation site.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Project website for "Image Analysis for Archival Discovery (Aida)"  Libraries, archives, museums, and other groups are creating millions and millions of digital images as we digitize the cultural record. For the most part, though, these digital images are under-utilized, and we leverage little of their information potential. At the same time, locating relevant materials in digital collections is often already a difficult endeavor and will become increasingly so as more content is digitized. The Aida team is exploring what more we can do with the millions of images that represent the digitized cultural record—particularly digital images of textual materials—and we are interested in the types of discovery that serious attention to digital images might yield.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Website for a two-day, NEH-sponsored workshop brings together pioneers in archaeology and computing to discuss the use, creation, and implementation of mobile tablet technology to advance digital archaeology, i.e., fully digital recording systems to create born-digital data in the field. Session themes are aimed at facilitating presentation, demonstration, and discussion on how archaeologists around the world use tablets or other digital tools in the field and lab and how best practices can be implemented across projects. The workshop highlights the advantages and future of mobile computing and its challenges and limitations. The workshop consists of formal paper sessions and opportunities for informal discussion of the issues and themes at moderated discussions, demonstrations, round tables, and speaker meals. The workshop's goal is to synthesize current practices and establish a blueprint for creating best practices and moving forward with mobile tablets in archaeology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Slave Societies Digital Archive (SSDA), directed by Jane Landers and hosted at Vanderbilt University, is dedicated to identifying, cataloging, and digitally preserving endangered archival materials documenting the history of Africans and their descendants in the Atlantic World.  The SSDA's largest and oldest collections were generated by the Catholic Church, which mandated the baptism of African slaves in the fifteenth century and later extended this requirement to the Iberian New World. The baptismal records preserved in Slave Societies are the oldest and most uniform serial data available for the history of Africans in the Atlantic World and offer the most extensive information regarding their ethnic origins. Once baptized, Africans and their descendants were eligible for the sacraments of Christian marriage and burial, adding to their historical record. Through membership in the Catholic Church families also generated a host of other religious documentation such as confirmations, petitions to wed, wills, and even annulments. In addition, Africans and their descendants joined church brotherhoods organized along ethnic lines, through which they recorded not only ceremonial and religious aspects of their lives but their social, political, and economic networks as well.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Trans-Atlantic and Intra-American slave trade databases are the culmination of several decades of independent and collaborative research by scholars drawing upon data in libraries and archives around the Atlantic world. The new Voyages website itself is the product of three years of development by a multi-disciplinary team of historians, librarians, curriculum specialists, cartographers, computer programmers, and web designers, in consultation with scholars of the slave trade from universities in Europe, Africa, South America, and North America. The National Endowment for the Humanities was the principal sponsor of this work carried out at Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, the University of California at Irvine, and the University of California at Santa Cruz. The Hutchins Center of Harvard University has also provided support.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Discography of American Historical Recordings (DAHR) is a database of master recordings made by American record companies during the 78rpm era. It is part of the American Discography Project (ADP)—an initiative of the University of California, Santa Barbara that is edited by a team of researchers based at the UCSB Library.  DAHR is an expansion of the Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings (EDVR) incorporating previously published discographic data licensed from various publishers, folding them into the search and display framework of DAHR. Documentation of the activities of the Victor Talking Machine Company and RCA Victor derives primarily from consultation of publications of the companies and original documents held in the archives of Sony Music Entertainment in New York City. DAHR entries describing recordings made by Columbia Records, the Berliner Gramophone Co., OKeh Records, Zonophone Records, Leeds &amp;amp; Catlin Records, and Decca are based on authoritative published discographies, supplemented with new research, examination of recordings in the collections of the University of California Santa Barbara Library, and submissions from record collectors and archives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Automated Music Performance Analysis and Comparison Toolkit for the MATLAB programming environment automatically analzyes performance data from recordings where a score is available By using the information available in the score about what notes are expected in the performance and the order in which they occur.  AMPACT provides estimates of note onsets and offsets for tones with non-percussive onsets (e.g., vocalists) that are more robust than blind onset detection algorithms The alignment algorithm and the analysis portion of toolkit are be available in AMPACT Version 0.3. The analysis portion for monophonic audio includes the extraction of various performance parameters: inter-onset intervals between notes and tempo information; relative dynamic level between notes; mean frequency for each note and interval sizes in cents; vibrato rate and depth. For polyphonic audio, AMPACT produces estimates of onsets and offsets for all of the voices in notated simultaneities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Vamonde web page and phone app for a 10-mile bike tour through the South Side neighborhoods where violence erupted during the summer of 1919. The tour starts at the only marker of the riots in the city--at 29th Street and the lakefront--and then moves through Bronzeville, Bridgeport, the Stockyards, and back toward the lake. Historical photographs of and information about sites of violence encourage riders to visualize the past. Where did the events of 1919 take place? How have neighborhoods changed over time? Where does one see boundaries and segregation while riding these streets? How can one see and feel history in the city's built environment?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Reading Chicago Reading" is a digital humanities project that takes as its starting point the popular and much-imitated "One Book, One Chicago" (OBOC) program operated by the Chicago Public Library (CPL) since 2001. Each year (originally every six months), the library chooses one book around which to organize city-wide events, discussions, and other programming. For our purposes, the OBOC program acts as a natural experiment. The 25 different books that have been chosen since the program's inception can be thought of as probes into the reading behavior of the city. The dependent variables of interest are, of course, the patterns of reading behavior that these probes elicit. We make use of scholarship in the history and sociology of reading as an interpretive baseline representing the standard approach. But our study, by bringing together Computer Science and Humanities research methods, promises new kinds of insight and new forms of quantifiable data.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1830 until the 1890s, already free and once captive Black people came together in state and national political meetings called "Colored Conventions." Before the War, they strategized about how to achieve educational, labor and legal justice at a moment when Black rights were constricting nationally and locally. After the War, their numbers swelled as they continued to mobilize to ensure that Black citizenship rights and safety, Black labor rights and land, Black education and institutions would be protected under the law.  The delegates to these meetings included the most well-known, if mostly male, writers, organizers, church leaders, newspaper editors, and entrepreneurs in the canon of early African-American leadership—and thousands whose names and histories have long been forgotten. What is left of this phenomenal effort are rare proceedings, newspaper coverage, and petitions that have never before been collected in one place. This project seeks to not only learn about the lives of male delegates, the places where they met and the social networks that they created, but also to account for the crucial work done by Black women in the broader social networks that made these conventions possible.  Please see the About Us page for information about the project team.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project examines medical discussion as well as news reporting during the Russian influenza epidemic, from its outbreak in late 1889 through the successive waves that lasted through 1893. It will collect English and German-language reports in digitized newspapers and medical journals, leading to the first comprehensive searchable documentation of the disease. The data will be used to extract facts and timelines regarding the disease, investigate medical and public reaction to the spreading epidemic and research how medical knowledge was disseminated via popular reporting. As a bilingual project, developing methods and tools that work across both English-language and German-language sources, this project offers unique insights into a historical era when transnational medical research and global news reporting were important parts of the collective human experience</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The MTAAC project develops and applies new computerized methods to translate and analyze the contents of some 67,000 highly standardized administrative documents from southern Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) from the 21st century BC. Our methodology, which combines machine learning with statistical and neural machine translation technologies, can then be applied to other ancient languages. This methodology, the translations, and the historical, social and economic data extracted from them, will be offered to the public in open access.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>GeoPACHA (Geospatial Platform for Andean Culture, History and Archaeology) is a browser-based, edited geospatial platform for discovering and mapping archaeological sites in the Andean region of South America. It is designed to facilitate the identification of archaeological sites through "virtual survey" of satellite and aerial imagery and consists of a simple browser-based interface that enables users to visually scan imagery and plot the locations of archaeological sites to a central GIS database using point themes. GeoPACHA also enables the registry of attribute data with site locations via form-based data entry. A grid-based system tracks coverage and sites are recorded.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Curated by  Christian Keathley— Middlebury College   This special issue of [in]Transition is the second featuring work that emerged from the June 2017 workshop Scholarship in Sound &amp;amp; Image, hosted at Middlebury College and generously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities. The workshop brought 15 participants -- graduate students this time -- in film and media from the United States and Europe to work with a team of experts to collectively explore how to produce and conceptualize videographic criticism. The participants had a range of video production experience, but the majority were novices. By the end of the two weeks, all participants had started producing a piece of videographic criticism based on their research area.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Yellowtail Dam Struggle and the Following Court Case Over Control of the Big Horn River --  Yellowtail Dam- Raphaelle interviewed four people regarding the development of Yellowtail Dam in the 1950s. All four felt that the deal reached with government was unacceptable and stole money and control of the reservation's water from the Crow people. There is no River Crow perspective given in the interviews. That said, many discussed the factionalism of the period and that it had ramifications politically to this day on the reservation by normalizing this behavior.  Big Horn River Case- These interviews were with individuals who worked in some capacity in the federal case that took control of the Big Horn River away from the Crows at its conclusion in the US Supreme Court. Some participated in protests, while others worked on legal briefings during the case. All interviewees discussed the effects of the case on the Crow people at the conclusion of each interview, which they obviously thought was not very positive.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Reparations for African-Americans has been a hot topic on the presidential campaign trail, with Democratic candidates including Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren coming out in favor of compensation for unpaid African-American labor.  But the debate around reparations is nothing new. In fact, it goes back centuries.  On this episode, Nathan, Ed and Brian explore the complicated – and often contentious – history of reparations, from the first mass reparations movement led by Callie House, an ex-slave, to a unique moment when African-Americans in Florida received compensation for the destruction of their community.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Edward A. Rogers collection is the largest known vestige of the archive of the Cardinell-Vincent Company, the official photographers of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915. It comprises approximately 6,700 photographic prints housed in albums, 2,166 glass negatives, 124 film negatives, and 115 panoramic film negatives. The great majority of images document the exposition throughout its 1915 run, but some commercial photographs taken by Cardinell-Vincent date from the decade after the fair. During the construction period in 1913 and 1914 the exposition's photographic contract was held by H.S. Crocker &amp;amp; Co., and a significant number of their images are present.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mapping the 1919 Chicago Riot is a collaborative project from researchers at the University of Chicago to visualise the 1919 riot combining original historical sources with modern geospatial technologies. They have compiled official reports and contemporary newspaper articles to map and detail incidents of deaths, injury, and arson that occurred during the riots, as well as geo-locating original photographs taken during that time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Newspapers, public figures, and family stories have crafted lasting explanations of the violence in 1919 that are still popular. One account suggests that the riots were the result of white ethnic working-class Chicagoans feeling vulnerable in the wake of the Great Migration; in other words, white immigrant laborers felt threatened by black workers as they vied for jobs, housing, and cultural influence in the city. This narrative is an apology for white supremacy, however, and fails to account for the decades of black prosperity in Chicago prior to 1919 that did not result in violence. Archival items held at the Newberry Library tell a deeper story, one about racist housing and labor policies, incendiary newspaper articles, roving bands of violent white youths, and a pivotal moment when black Chicagoans demanded equal protection under the law.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Black history has a long presence in Indianapolis, and makes up the very fabric of the city. Six years after the founding of Indianapolis, out of the 1,066 total residents 55 were African American (source). There is no history of Indianapolis without Indianapolis' vibrant and diverse Black population.     The Black History, Indianapolis History digital archive owes its existence to the dedication of the Indianapolis community to preserve and share family history. Thanks to a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) between 2018 and 2019, seven community cultural heritage preservation events were held at Indianapolis Public Library branches around the city. These Scan-A-Thons invited community members to bring family photos and memorabilia to be scanned, recorded, and made publicly available in the Black History, Indianapolis History digital archive by Indianapolis Public Library staff.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The city of Los Angeles became the epicenter of a public relations scandal on March 3, 1991, when an amateur cameraman captured on video four uniformed LAPD officers beating motorist Rodney G. King. In addition to generating public outrage, the incident cast a dark shadow over the LAPD and called into question the integrity of the nation's third largest municipal police force. Subsequently, the ten member Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department was formed to conduct a full and fair evaluation of all aspects of the LAPD's structure and operations related to the use of force when making arrests. Included in this collection are the documents that were collected and analyzed by the Commission over the course of its study.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Chaired by former federal judge and FBI and CIA Director William H. Webster, the Los Angeles Webster Commission assessed law enforcement's performance in connection with the April, 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest. The collection consists of materials collected and studied by the Commission over the course of its investigation. Materials pertain to both the Los Angeles incident specifically, and civil disturbance, civil unrest control, and policing tactics in general.  Included in the collection are the following: interviews with LAPD officers, law enforcement personnel, government officials, community leaders, and activists; articles, broadcasts, and press releases covering the civil unrest; various tactical and contingency plans created for disasters and emergencies; reports, studies, and manuals about civil unrest control and prevention; literature about community-based policing strategies; emergency plans and procedures developed by other cities; and after-action reports issued once the civil unrest had subsided. Also featured are items related to the internal operations of the LAPD both before and during the civil unrest, including activity reports, meeting agendas and minutes, arrest data, annual reports, curricula and educational materials, and personnel rosters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The collection is comprised of the reports created as a result of two seminars and a conference related to a critque of the McCone Report following the 1965 Los Angeles civil unrest. In addition to the reports directly related to the seminars and conference, the materials include documents from training programs for U.S. Air Force Security and Law Enforcement Officers for 1965, 1966, and 1967. These publications were the result of work done through USC with Air Force Law Enforcement personnel to help them establish skills in administration and in dealing with race relations, relative to the work done on the McCone report. Each of the participants was assigned a different city administrator -- many of whom had been educated at the USC School of Public Administration -- to gain experience, share ideas, and prepare a written report.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The collection consists of the report published by the governor's commission following the Los Angeles civil unrest of 1965, also known as the Watts Riots, and the supporting documentation. The report itself is titled, "Violence in the City—An End or a Beginning?: A Report by the Governor's Commission on the Los Angeles Riots, 1965". While the additional documents are primarily transcripts of testimony, the testimonies come from a wide range of people directly and indirectly involved in the civil unrest, including Governor Pat Brown, Lieutenant Governor Glen Anderson, several leaders of the Los Angeles Police Department and National Guard, some business leaders, and many members of the affected communities. Some of the other documents include reports about different aspects of the communities and the civil unrest, including arrests, damages, and employment. The commission was headed by John A. McCone, former CIA director. This is copy 7 of the report.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public Knowledge was a collaborative, multifaceted project that promoted public dialogue among a dynamic network of partners on the cultural impact of urban and technological change in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the stakes involved in surviving, resisting, adapting to and attempting to shape these changes. Public Knowledge operated from 2017 through 2019, and was led by SFMOMA in collaboration with the San Francisco Public Library. Public Knowledge was funded by a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  Our collaborators—including artists, librarians, and community partners—researched and created relevant, accessible and imaginative experiences for museumgoers and library patrons that nurtured a culture of inquiry and fostered public participation on key questions related to the profound shifts taking place in San Francisco. Public Knowledge comprised their contributions, including thought-provoking projects led by contemporary artists from near and far; free talks, discussions, performances and creative workshops; and interviews and essays from The Stacks, our online publication.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Civic Data Solidarity invited participants from organizations that generate and manage independent databases on a range of civil society issues to bring their data and learn how to create interactive maps to "untangle complex relations that impact them and their communities." Through workshops and Graph Commons, Burak's free online collaborative platform for making, analyzing and publishing network maps, participants created bridges and connections between different sets of data across organizations and even political interests. Ultimately, the goal was to teach people how to use mapping and visualization tools to strengthen communities, connect resources and knowledge, and foster civic solidarity through data. Check out the Civic Data Solidarity workshop maps: Silicon Valley Diversity: Companies and Their Investors and Treasure Island Cleanup and Redevelopment, interact with our own Public Knowledge map, and use Graph Commons to begin mapping your own network.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Kerameikos.org is a collaborative project dedicated to defining the intellectual concepts of pottery following the tenets of linked open data and the formulation of an ontology for representing and sharing ceramic data across disparate data systems. While the project is focused primarily on the definition of concepts within Greek black- and red-figure pottery, Kerameikos.org is extensible toward the definition of concepts in other fields of pottery studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>PEN (originally P.E.N., an acronym for Poets, Essayists, and Novelists) is an international writers' organization with member centers present in over 100 countries worldwide. Founded in London in 1921 by Catharine Amy Dawson Scott, PEN began as a simple dinner club, meant to bring writers together to socialize and share ideas. Within a few years, the organization grew to include centers throughout Europe, and by the 1930s included centers in Asia and South America. PEN remains one of the top international writers' organizations in the world and its members continue to champion the organization's ideals: celebrating literature, defending free expression, protecting writers at risk, supporting writers in exile, and promoting linguistic rights around the globe. The PEN Records, 1912-2008 (bulk 1926-1997), occupy 362 boxes (153 linear feet) documenting the history and activities of the English PEN Centre and PEN International, as well as the formation (and sometimes dissolution) of other PEN centers around the globe. The PEN Digital Collection contains 3,500 images of newsletters, minutes, reports, scrapbooks, and ephemera selected from the PEN Records. To further enhance research, the English PEN newsletters (1927-1964) and minutes (1931-1970) have undergone OCR conversion to create full-text searchable documents, enabling users to locate names, events, and topics in their original chronological contexts and use that information much like an index into the rest of the archive.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This digital mapping project combines historical photographs, newspapers articles, documents, digital sites, and oral histories to tell the story of the Historic West End, a network of rich and vibrant African American neighborhoods that surround the campus of Johnson C. Smith University and are currently faced with rising concerns of displacement and change as Charlotte grows. The project seeks to tell the stories of these communities through the eyes of those who lived there and still do by conducting oral histories with long-time residents, and by documenting the businesses, churches, schools,  nightclubs, parks, restaurants, and dynamic personalities and events that have shaped the corridor.      This project uses a large archive of unseen photographs and negatives from the James G. Peeler Collection held at Johnson C. Smith University and also utilizes material from other local archives, libraries, institutions, and agencies including the Carolina Room of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Public Library, Special Collections at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, the Charlotte Observer and the Charlotte Post, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department, and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2005, the Amarna Project began a long-term study of the cemeteries of Amarna, with the goal of better understanding the health, life experiences and beliefs of the people of Akhetaten through an integrated study of human remains and burial practices. From 2005 to 2013, fieldwork focussed upon the largest of the city's non-elite burial grounds, the South Tombs Cemetery, located in a long wadi adjacent to the southern group of officials' tombs. In Spring 2015, a second phase of the cemeteries project began, with a shift in focus to the north end of the Amarna bay, where there are a several additional non-elite burial grounds near the North Tombs . The largest, which probably includes several thousand interments, occupies a broad wadi between North Tombs 2 and 3 (see image above). There is a smaller cemetery at the base of the cliffs adjacent to the tomb of Panehesy (no. 6) and another in the low desert some 700 m to the west of this.  The study of the northern cemeteries is funded primarily by a National Endowment of the Humanities Research Grant, awarded to Southern Illinois University in partnership with the Amarna Project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The GWFPP exists at the intersection of two challenges editors currently face: managing complicated editorial work and navigating the world of digital publication. The project focuses on a particularly difficult and dynamic dataset—financial documents. Work has advanced on three interconnected fronts: 1) developing document templates for both traditional financial documents, such as account books and ledgers, and for more esoteric texts, including receipts, journals, and memoranda; 2) developing taxonomies and data visualizations; and 3) constructing an open-source platform for content management, editing, and publication. In the course of tackling these challenges, the project has not only developed an open-access digital edition of GW's, but also laid the groundwork for a Drupal for Editors prototype. This Drupal-based, open-source, editorial/publication platform will provide editors with a stable, flexible, and powerful platform to build engaging digital editions of financial documents.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The associations between America and Asia that dominated the geographical and cultural imagination of Europe for two centuries after 1492 pose a fundamental conceptual challenge, making it necessary to suspend the definition of the words "America" and "Asia" and imagine an early modern "Amerasia." Even when it became common to separate the continents on maps, themes of Amerasian thinking remained in place. This web portal aims to bring the Amerasian worldview back to life for contemporary readers.  In 1545, the German mathematician and cartographer Caspar Vopel (1511-1561) designed a famous and influential map of the world that spectacularly embodies the Amerasian worldview. Vopel's original is now lost, and we know it through a reprint made by Venetian printer Giovanni Andrea Vavassore in 1558, a large-scale, woodblock-printed wall map in twelve sheets entitled A New Complete and Universal Description of the Whole World According to the Modern German Tradition.  Although well known in its time, today a single copy of the Vopel/Vavassore map survives in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Using an interactive, high-definition interface, this website explores the map's content—its toponyms, cartouches, figurative images, and textual descriptions—amplifying the map through a wide-ranging explanatory apparatus. Pink pins offer short entries about locations on the map, blue pins indicate translated cartouches, and yellow pins offer more extended essays pegged to sites and inscriptions with particular Amerasian significance.  In the spirit of the National Endowment for the Humanities Collaborative Fellowship that supported its creation, we present this online platform for the Vopel map as an invitation to collaborative scholarship. We invite additional entries on toponyms or themes relevant to the Amerasia problem, hoping that this new digital tool encourages an accelerated and dynamic scholarly exchange.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Chicago Black Social Culture Map is an online public humanities project documenting Black social culture from the Great Migration through the early 21st century with a focus on the emergence of house music and dance in the 1980s. The map features profiles for over 350 different venues, including basic information, first-person stories, and supplemental media, all collected through collaborative community research. The CBSCM exists to preserve Chicago's black social cultural lineage - past, present, and future - through an experience that is both fun and informative. In Fall 2018, we launched this interactive digital initiative with a community archiving day including panel discussions, archiving stations, and hands on demonstrations of the online map. In 2019, we are growing that experience into a series of roving map and archiving days focused on the social scene across the city's South, West, and North sides. Each day features public spaces, personalities, and cultural history connected to specific city geographies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Mapping Renewal beta website focused on creating access and providing context to segregation and urban renewal in the city of Little Rock, Arkansas. Geographic segregation in Little Rock was, in part, the result of urban renewal projects of the kind that swept the nation in the mid-twentieth century. In the 1960s, urban renewal in central Little Rock comprised one of the largest demolition and clearance programs in the country. Instead of reinvigorating the city, these programs, like so many others carried out across the U.S., further promoted segregation and white flight. Mapping Renewal aims to make valuable humanities content widely accessible through digitization and geolocation of a unique compilation of materials that will allow a range of users to integrate the history of Little Rock into larger studies of the twentieth-century American metropolis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association (1988) case made headlines in national and international arenas as several California Indian tribes were protesting the building of a road between Gasquet and Orleans in Northern California. The sacred spaces, geological and ecological formations and the ongoing practice of traditional ceremonies in the High Country were of little concern to the Forest Service. They had already built paved sections in the region and now all they needed to connect Gasquet to Orleans was to pave the six mile section which ran through the High Country. While the case culminated in the 1987 Supreme Court arguments, it had been fought for many years before through grassroots organizing and lower court cases which had all sided with Native tribes and upheld an injunction that stopped the building of the road.   Students at Humboldt State University have been working with Native American Studies Professors Dr. Cutcha Risling Baldy (Hupa, Karuk, Yurok, enrolled Hoopa Valley Tribe); Dr. Kayla Begay (Hoopa Valley Tribe); and Special Collections Librarian Carly Marino to document and create an online archive of materials about the G-O Road. These items will be publically available on a website to help people explore the history and continued impact of the case. The archive features documents like letters from Ceremonial Leaders, written by hand, that ask for protection of the High Country. It also features a journal kept by Karuk artist and activist Julian Lang, who participated in the protests and fight against the G-O Road. In one of his journal sketches he wrote: "Protect Indian Religion. NO-GO. Fix the Earth. NEVER SAY I'M NOTHING. If you fix the Earth you ARE somebody! Stop the Gasquet-Orleans Road in Northern California. STOP THE ROAD."</Abstract>

Ko, along with co-principal investigator Dr. Sungyoung Kim (RIT) and aural heritage consultant Dr. Miriam Kolar, research how building acoustics influence human experience, particularly in religious, performance and other public gathering spaces. The researchers will develop, test and share their aural heritage process via three case studies, which represent culturally, architecturally and temporally distinct examples of endangered aural heritage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The ICAA Documents of 20th-century Latin American and Latino Art digital archive provides access to primary sources and critical documents tracing the development of twentieth-century art in Latin America and among Latino populations in the United States. Recovered texts provide a much-needed intellectual foundation for the exhibition, collection, and interpretation of art produced along this cultural axis. Countries featured in the first phase of this multiyear project include Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Latino USA. The ICAA Digital Archive reflects the findings of this monumental digitization project and is now available, free of charge, to the research and teaching community as well as to the public at large. The uploading of documents to the archive is an ongoing process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Timeline of African American Music is an engaging and innovative digital resource that makes humanities content on African American music, culture, and history accessible to a broad public audience. Based on the work of lead scholar Dr. Portia Maultsby, the Founding Director of the Archives of African America Music and Culture at Indiana University, the digital timeline presents a survey of the evolution of African American musical genres over the past 400 years—from the earliest folk traditions to contemporary popular music. It serves as an introduction to the richness and diversity of African American music, focusing on the distinct characteristics and development of each genre and offering an in-depth look at the pioneers who defined some of America's most influential artistic expressions. Visitors can learn about various genres and historical movements through multimedia stories, photos, historical images (including related holdings from Carnegie Hall's Archives), and listen to musical works.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Notch8, a web consultancy based in San Diego, California, is ARCE's development partner on the Conservation Archives web portal front-end. ARCE hired Notch8 to build an Archives web portal interface, as well as harvest digital assets from UCLA Library in order to publish the pilot collections online. Notch8 has been involved with digital repositories since 2016, including multiple Blacklight-based applications like this project.   This prototype site eventually will go live in the form of an open access and free to use web portal adopting a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA), in early Fall 2020. The arce/archive web portal will host five different collections (Red Monastery Architectural Conservation, Conservation of Alsam Al Silahdar, The Funerary Enclosure of Shunet El Zebib, Conservation of Luxor Roman Wall Paintings and Tomb of Anen) making available images, reports and graphic documentation to the public.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>This URL is a staging site that contractor Notch8 developed and shared with ARCE project team so they can experience the feeling of the interface and work on the desired facets and discuss on possible improvements. Also, staging site ascertains that the forthcoming ARCE conservation archive web portal will resemble the arce.org frontend.
There's no fixed timeline to pull down the staging site, and it should be live at least until we have a live production site url to share with the public by early Fall 2020.
However a prototype site in working order is not guaranteed as the staging server is more vulnerable and developers might move to different server.In this case the prototype site might not load.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Primary sources and essays revealing stories of women's activism leading up to the right to vote.  Long before the women's suffrage movement brought about the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, women were making themselves heard in a variety of ways that broadly transformed the American experience, including working for moral reform, abolition, and increased opportunities for education and employment. The Philadelphia region was among the most important centers for these movements.  DISCOVER Use search and browse tools to find documents and collection descriptions.

		<Abstract>The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has awarded the American Numismatic Society (ANS) a substantial grant of $262,000 to fund the web-based Hellenistic Royal Coinages (HRC) project. Under the direction of Curator Dr. Peter van Alfen and Director of Data Science Ethan Gruber, this three year project (Phase 1, planned for 2017­ - 2020) promises to radically transform the ability of students, scholars, and collectors to identify and research Hellenistic royal coinages, and to incorporate this numismatic material into broad analyses of political, economic, and social history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Legends, literature, media, and history are full of stories about heroes who rise to the occasion in moments of need, taking on great risk for the good of others. What makes a person able to perform heroic acts? Is this something that certain people are just born with, or does it grow out of our circumstances and upbringing? Related to this is the essential question of how much control we actually have over our own self-making. Major thinkers have debated these questions for centuries, and individuals continue to grapple with them as they face down the challenges — sometimes seemingly small, other times impossibly large — of everyday life.   The books in this series each take a different view of what it means to be a hero, considering how the combination of unique social circumstances, compassion for others, and inner resources can make it possible for young people to perform acts that they may not have imagined themselves capable of achieving.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Empathy has been held up as a balm for our divided society by everyone from neuroscientists to primatologists to political thinkers. Yet as the consensus grows that we need to cultivate more empathy, the scarcer it seems to become. From political debates, to cultural choices, to classroom conversations, we seem increasingly unable to engage in empathetic exchange. Instead, we pick sides and dig in against perceived enemies.  Recent studies have made the case that literature is perhaps our greatest resource for developing empathy; as authors push us to inhabit the lives of their characters, we find ourselves a little less likely to retreat behind the walls of our own moral certainty. 2 The books chosen for this series complicate that equation: each text encourages readers to explore the power of empathy, but also helps us understand why empathy can be so hard to come by. Each text invites the readers to, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, "slip ... into another's skin, another's voice, another's soul." They also confront readers with the dangers of feeling — and acting on — another's pain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Growing from a child to a teenager to a young adult usually involves a number of rites of passage. From bar and bat mitzvahs, sweet sixteen parties, and quinceñeras, to getting a driver's license, attending prom, and graduating from high school, there are any number of formal and often public rituals that mark the steady journey from childhood to adulthood. While these events vary from culture to culture, they usually include educational milestones, parties that celebrate maturity, and special responsibilities that reflect newfound trust from one's community. These moments can be both scary and exciting.  However, many formative moments for young people happen in more informal settings. Everything from dating to dealing with family or society at large all provide opportunities for challenge and growth. And the truth is that young people are not navigating these public and private moments in a vacuum. Indeed, young people are sometimes figuring out their morals, values, and increasing independence while living in societies that do not always value their newfound voices. This circumstance is drawn into particularly sharp relief for young people in historically marginalized groups. Not only do they have to figure out all the "normal" stuff that comes with growing up, they have to do so with the added burden of negative social pressure. The books in this series emphasize the role of discovering one's own power, exploring how protagonists find out who they are and what they stand for. They also emphasize fighting the powers that be, often by banding together with other scared, but brave, folks who are not only willing to fight for themselves but for the good of the greater society. Finally, they explore the consequences of bravery, illustrating how young people's choices can have an impact on themselves and the world around them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even past." As a candidate for president for the United States in 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama used these words to argue that we can only ever truly understand — and begin to overcome — the bitterness of modern race relations in the light of brave and accurate accounting of history. Obama's line is a slightly altered version of a quote from Southern author William Faulkner; in other words, he turned to literature as a source of wisdom about the difficult subject of race in America, and built upon what he found there to imagine new pathways towards justice, healing, and unity.  The "Deeper Than Our Skins" theme is grounded in literature that can help us look beneath the surface of racism in America to reveal how the past is alive in the present. This theme uses powerful stories of oppression, resistance, suffering, and triumph to identify the roots of racialized experience in the United States, and to inspire discussions around how to construct more equitable futures for the people in our nation and world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The old adage goes "children should be seen and not heard." That conventional wisdom implies that speaking up and out is the exclusive realm of adults. It also suggests that children and young people don't have important things to say — that they should stay out of adult conversation.  The truth is that young people have been vital to making change by speaking and showing up in the face of adversity. Take Joan of Arc, for example. In 1429, while just 18 years old, she led a French army to the besieged city of Orléans in a victory over the English.   But we don't have to go back to 15th-century France to find young heroes. On November 14, 1960, 6-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first African American child to integrate a white Southern elementary school. Her mother and U.S. marshals had to escort young Ruby to class because of violent mobs in her hometown of New Orleans. Bridges was born the same year that Brown v. Board of Education made "separate but equal" public spaces illegal, and her bravery was a milestone in the Civil Rights movement.   This series includes books that highlight the necessity and power of young people speaking up against injustice despite challenges, social pressure, and even the threat of bigger dangers. Whether it is finding righteous anger as a superpower or pursuing activism through poetry and art, Finding Your Voice features young people speaking out against racism and other systems of oppression in order to change the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1619, the first Africans were brought against their will across the Atlantic Ocean to the Virginia colony. It marked the beginning of the institution of slavery in the Unites States. Over 400 years later, the United States is still grappling with the legacy of slavery and systemic racism. Generations of African Americans have been subject to untold cruelty. However, it is also true that much of America's current prosperity can be traced back to the contributions of slaves. This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, provide a retrospective of the origins of the African slave trade in the U.S. The episode raises difficult questions about how we should commemorate the 400-year anniversary of this dark moment in American history. Using modern perspectives, students will form arguments on how to best approach the legacy of slavery in the United States.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This month marks the 400th anniversary of the first Africans' arrival at what would become British North America. It wasn't the first time Africans set foot in what became the United States – they'd arrived some 100 years earlier with Spanish colonists. But 1619 looms large in American history because it marks the beginning of slavery's development in the Virginia colony and later the entire nation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are over 28,000 threatened species in the world. But this is hardly the first time our planet has faced the prospect of mass extinction.  In the beginning of the 20th century, America's flora and fauna were seriously threatened by urban encroachment and over-hunting. And one animal at the center of this struggle was the bison.  So in celebration of World Animal Day, Brian and Nathan explore the history of bison in America. We'll find out how the bison went from an animal in excess to near extinction and we'll learn how Madison Grant's work preserving the bison went hand and hand with his theories on eugenics. Plus, we'll hear from the Buffalo Representative of the Eastern Shoshone about his efforts to restore the buffalo.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Atthebeginningofthe19th century,millionsofAmericanbisonfreelyroamedtheplains. They were an important and sacred part of the lives of Native American tribes. However, in the years following the Civil War, westward expansion from frontiersmen resulted in the rapid decline of the bison population. The expanding railroad system gave settlers unprecedented access to hunting and transporting bison herds. The United States government saw a strategic benefit in allowing overhunting, knowing that it would upend society for Native Americans. As a result, bison were nearly hunted into extinction by the end of the century. This lesson and corresponding BackStory episode explore the reasons for the decimation ofthebisonpopulationduringthe19th century.Italsooutlineshistoricalandcontemporary efforts to conserve and protect this species. Bison are often used as a positive symbol of the American Great Plains. However, as this lesson examines, the destruction of the bison population also represents darker undercurrents of United States history such as colonization and Manifest Destiny.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>If you turn on the news, you're likely to find a heated debate about big issues, from citizenship to voting rights. For Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Eric Foner, these issues are at the heart of what are often called the "Reconstruction Amendments": the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the US Constitution. They were passed in 1865, 1868 and 1870, respectively. And if you ask Eric, they've been misinterpreted and overlooked for generations.   On this episode, Ed sits down with Eric Foner, a professor emeritus of history at Columbia University, to talk about public perceptions of Reconstruction, the landmark amendments to the Constitution and how they have the power to change the country today. Foner's new book is The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the years following the Civil War, the United States government faced the difficult challenges of needing to heal the country while providing rights and opportunities to African Americans.The passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution provided unprecedented rights for African Americans. However, these rights were not always realized because of coordinated efforts in the American south to undermine federal law with state laws and regulations that maintained segregation and disenfranchisement. Though federal law had changed, these "Jim Crow" laws prevented African Americans from achieving true equality. For this reason, many historians have categorized the Reconstruction era as a "failure." This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, focus on the legacy of the Reconstruction era. The episode provides an interview with historian Eric Foner. He argues that Reconstruction should be thought of as an "unfinished revolution" rather than a historical failure. In fact, he believes that the United States is still grappling with the fallout of the Reconstruction Amendments in today's political landscape. The goal of this lesson is to provide a critical lens for viewing both the positive and negative elements of Reconstruction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>White supremacy has been in the news a lot recently. It is often seen as a movement at the fringes of American society, and discussion of it rarely includes white women. But women play a critical, if overlooked, role in the white supremacy movement, and examining their involvement shows it to be far less fringe than many think. So on this episode of BackStory, Brian, Nathan and Joanne dig into the little known history of white women and white supremacy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the wake of the 2017 "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, there has been an increased awareness of white supremacy in the national discourse. However, white supremacy movements have existed in the United States since the founding of the country. Following the abolition of slavery, white supremacy groups fought for continued segregation with Jim Crow laws. Historians have often focused on the role of men in shaping the national narrative of white supremacy. However, this lens ignores the contributions of white women throughout history who fought to maintain racial hierarchies.  This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, focus on the women of different white supremacy movements throughout American history. Far from being innocent bystanders, women frequently took an active role in trying to preserve the status quo of racial inequality. The episode discusses white supremacy in three different contexts: slavery during the 19th century, during Jim Crow-era segregation, and today. Because of the sensitive nature of the subject matter, some elements of this lesson plan may be difficult for some students to hear and discuss.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In November 2019, Sesame Street celebrated its 50th anniversary of being on television. The original concept of the show was simple: using television to teach young children. Specifically, the show's creators wanted to help young, disadvantaged children who were at risk of struggling in school. Sesame Street has evolved over these fifty years, but the show's core objective remains the same. Though income inequality has remained a significant problem in the United States, Sesame Street remains steadfast in providing equal educational opportunities for children.  As the audience for Sesame Street has grown, the show has used its characters to embody the values of multiculturalism and diversity. The show has incorporated characters with autism, HIV, and physical disabilities to provide children with relatable examples of people different from themselves. They have also embraced different cultures, languages, races, and ethnicities, giving children opportunities to see themselves in the lives of puppets. As a result, Sesame Street has become a global phenomenon with variations of the show existing in countries across the world.  This lesson focuses on the history of Sesame Street and its value in promoting diversity and multiculturalism. Using a segment about Rosita, a longstanding bilingual character, students will examine how the show explores issues of identity and diversity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>‘Tis the season for giving. Whether it's the latest gadget or the coziest sweater, many Americans are spending the month of December searching for that perfect gift. But throughout American history, gift giving has taken on many different forms. And the act of giving and receiving has allowed bonds to form across social, political, and cultural divides.   On this episode of BackStory, Brian, Joanne and Nathan bring you two very different stories of giving and receiving. One starts in Ireland, and the other looks at a time when lending a helping hand resulted in more harm than good.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This BackStory episode focuses on two different examples of giving in American history. One story chronicles the generous giving of money by Native Americans to people in Ireland suffering from the Great Famine of 1845. The other story discusses the underappreciated contributions of African Americans in providing relief to the people of Philadelphia during an outbreak of yellow fever in the 1790s. In both stories, the gifts represent a connection between people of different backgrounds, cultures, and races. As you go through the lesson, ask students to focus on how these gifts were given and received. What can we learn from gift-giving throughout U.S. history?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nostalgia is a sentimental longing for something from the past. It is a universal feeling that exists in different ways in our popular culture and politics. Just as the television show "I Love The 90s" appealed to a population of millennials, Donald Trump's campaign slogan of "Make America Great Again" harkens back to a bygone era of American history.  This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, examine different examples of nostalgia throughout American history, including music, television, architecture, and politics. With each example of nostalgia presented, students should be encouraged to consider why it gained traction among a certain population of Americans. Additionally, students need to consider whether the idealized version of America conflicts with the experience of different minority groups.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1948 to the early 1990s, South Africa used an institutional policy of segregation known as apartheid to marginalize the nonwhite population. Though whites were a minority group in South Africa, apartheid allowed them to exert control over the government, economy, and society. Apartheid faced opposition from the global community including the United Nations especially in the 1970s and 1980s. Social movements within South Africa intensified during this time as well, even as prominent black leaders like Nelson Mandela were imprisoned.  The United States government shifted its stance on South Africa throughout the 20th century. During much of the Cold War, the U.S. prioritized maintaining friendly alliances with anticommunist regimes over the fight for global equality. In competing with the Soviet Union, the U.S. also relied upon valuable minerals exported by the segregationist South African government. There were clear racial elements to U.S. policy as well, as many politicians were in favor of a continuation of domestic Jim Crow era laws promoting a segregated society.  This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, focus on the evolving history of relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Though the U.S. and South Africa have different histories, they shared racial and political upheaval throughout the 20th century. Examining the U.S. response to South Africa allows students to explore the complicated issues that shaped foreign policy during the Cold War era.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In early 2019, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam was embroiled in a political scandal regarding his use of blackface in a 1984 yearbook photograph. The photograph, from his time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, showed a person wearing blackface standing next to another person wearing a Ku Klux Klan uniform. The ensuing fallout from this revelation brought blackface and its presence throughout US history back to the forefront of American discourse. This lesson focuses on the enduring history of blackface in American culture. It emerged as a byproduct of minstrel shows following the American Civil War. Used as a form of mockery and vehicle for promoting racial stereotypes, minstrelsy was one of the most popular forms of entertainmentinthelate19th century. Thisunfortunatelegacycontinuedintothe20th century.Thoughtherearecountless examples of blackface used in various forms of entertainment, the Backstory episode highlights the legacy of blackface in the Mummers Parade. This Philadelphia New Year's Day tradition is one of the oldest folk festivals in the United States. It also has a history of explicit racial overtones and blackface. This legacy was challenged during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, leading to a conflict between African American groups and event participants. Though blackface was officially outlawed from the event in 1964, examples of racism, sexism, and bigotry have endured. Though the history of the Mummers Parade has an undeniable connection to blackface and racial stereotypes, thousands of people look forward to watching and participating in this annual tradition. Many of these participants have no knowledge of the history of the event. This lesson forces students to confront questions about the racist underpinnings of American culture. Can respected traditions of American culture be separated from their racist undertones? How does the legacy of blackface still permeate American society?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At many times throughout American history, there have been organized movements in favor of socialism. This debate continues in today's politics, as several candidates in the Democratic Party have advocated for a more socialist approach to the United States economy. For some Americans, socialism represents a more equitable distribution of power and wealth. For others, its values are completely antithetical to the "American Dream" and free enterprise. This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, focus on how the United States has grappled with socialism throughout its history. It covers the rise of labor movements in the late 19th andearly20th centuries,includingthePullmanStrikeandthecontributionsofEugeneV. Debs. It outlines the unique politics of Milwaukee, Wisconsin which elected three socialist mayors between 1910 and 1960. It discusses conservative critiques of socialism put forward by media figures such as Clarence Manion that still resonate in political discourse today. Finally, it examines the perspective of the current mayor of Jackson, Mississippi who is a self-identified socialist. For many people, there is a negative connotation to the term "socialism." This lesson explores some of the reasons behind this stigma. The goal is to get students to use a critical lens when examining the ongoing confrontation between socialism and capitalism throughout American history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Though the American Civil War concluded over 150 years ago, its effects still resonate in the social, economic, and political lives of millions of Americans. At the conclusion of the war, the federal government made efforts to rebuild the lives of former slaves. Though many of these "Reconstruction Era" efforts were well-meaning, they faced stiff opposition from former slave owners and politicians who did not want to enfranchise African Americans. As a result, many freed slaves faced generational socioeconomic hurdles preventing upward mobility. 21st centurypoliticiansandeconomistsarestillgrapplingwithhowtobestaddress significant disparities in wealth and racial equality. One frequently discussed idea is the payment of reparations to descendants of former slaves. The goal is to properly fulfill the failed promise of Reconstruction Era policies and fight against systemic and historical barriers to advancement. However, these policies come in many different forms and are contentious for many Americans. This lesson focuses on different aspects of reparations throughout American history. The goal is to force students to confront questions about how to best address ongoing disparities of race, wealth, and justice. How has the United States tried to address these questions in the past? Why has reparations endured as controversial issue in American politics today?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the early morning hours of June 28th, 1969, police officers raided The Stonewall Inn, a well-known gay bar in New York City. These types of raids occurred regularly and without incident at other gay bars and nightclubs in the city. However, on this night, patrons of the bar stayed outside and protested the police interference into their lives. Though this moment was not well-covered by the national media, it became a turning point in the fight for equal rights in the gay community. Many historians credit this demonstration as the spark that launched many different LGBTQ groups to form and start a more coordinated movement for equality. It also represents another challenge to the social and political status quo of the 1960s. This lesson, and the corresponding BackStory episode, focus the legacy of the uprising at Stonewall Inn. Because of the personal nature of many of the accounts presented, encourage students to focus on the events from a historical lens.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On July 20, 1969, the United States celebrated an amazing scientific achievement: landing the Apollo 11 on the surface of the moon. As Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first two men to walk on the lunar surface, the American public watched with nationalistic pride. This singular moment was the culmination of a decade of extensive efforts by the U.S. government and the scientific community. It also served as a public declaration of international supremacy during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This lesson reflects on the legacy of the "space race" during the 1960s. Fifty years after the fact, the moon landing is still celebrated as one of the greatest achievements in human history. However, this era is also often treated with an uncritical nostalgia. For many Americans, the Apollo 11 mission represents a moment of unity at a calamitous time in American history. For other Americans, the "space race" was a distraction from the fight for civil rights and the intractable conflict in Vietnam. As you go through the lesson, encourage students to think critically about these contradictions. Why does the Apollo 11 mission remain the subject of American nostalgia after fifty years? What role did the space race play in advancing social, economic, and geopolitical interests? How should we reflect on this time period as students of history?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Chicago00: 1893 World's Columbian Exposition reveals the history of Midway Plaisance and Jackson Park on the south side of Chicago. Over a century ago, this was the site of one of the largest and most important world's fairs in history. Millions of visitors came to Chicago to visit the temporary city of hundres of exhibitions. Jackson Park housed the White City; the Midway Plaisance was the mile long western entrance to the fair with a mix of entertainments, crass exoticism, and performers from around the world.  Offered here are 16 virtual reality panoramas of the sites, assembling historical photography from the archives of the Chicago History Museum, the Chicago Public Library, the Ryerson and Burnham Archives at the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Goodyear Archival Collection at the Brooklyn Museum Archives. The virtual reality video experience, linked in the menu, provides an animated ride on the central feature of the Midway: the 250 foot Ferris Wheel.</Abstract>

Registered users will be able to search or browse DEMCA's resources through linguistic means (e.g, Indigenous nomenclature, the semantics of plant and animal names), project or community filters, functional uses (e.g, fencing, ointments), collection data (e.g., altitude), and Western nomenclature (e.g, by binomial name, browsing by genus). Eventually users will be able to tag entries, create and store records in personalized databases, and download these sets of linked entries to their computer. Audio recordings of narratives and discussions in Indigenous languages on local flora and fauna will be accessible through continuous or line-by-line playback and the contents will be displayed in transcription and translation (Spanish) formats. Eventually video will be incorporated.  Development of the DEMCA data portal has been supported by the following programs: National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities Level 1 and Level 2 grants, National Science Foundation, Documentation of Endangered Languages Program, National Endowment for the Humanities Division of Preservation and Access, and the Endangered Language Documentation Programme. Software is based on Symbiota, data and web design by Civic Actions (for more details on specific awards, see Acknowledgements. Usage Policy. Copyright © 2016.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>DEMCA: Documenting the Ethnobiology of Mexico and Central America is a Symbiota-based portal that presents the cumulative ethnobotanical research of Amith over the past decade in over a dozen Nahuatl, Totonac, and Mixtec communities. In contrast to the more than 40 Symbiota-based portals based at Arizona State University, however, DEMCA adds ethnobotanical information to the biological information that is the type of content managed by all other Symbiota-based portals.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Undiscovered Shakespeare: The Wars of the Roses is a public arts and humanities series co-produced by Santa Cruz Shakespeare and UCSC's Shakespeare Workshop that brings professional actors and scholars together with the public for live readings and discussion of the works that made Shakespeare famous in the London theater. As a young writer at the start of his career, Shakespeare explored ambitions, rivalries, and passions that swept away the dynasty that had reigned in England for more than four centuries. Over the course of ten sessions, we will immerse ourselves in these rarely performed plays—in Henry VI, Parts 1, 2, and 3 and Richard III—and reflect on them both as points of departure for Shakespeare's career and as a mirror for the times in which we live.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Preserving and sharing the life stories of Southern Nevada's Latinx residents are important because these individuals and communities have played a significant role in our region's history but are underrepresented in our historical record. Today, approximately 29% of Southern Nevada's residents and more than 25% of UNLV's student body are Latinx.  Many Latinx residents have greatly influenced the progress of our educational system, multiple business sectors, politics, and cultural life in Southern Nevada. By collecting and preserving these oral histories, the UNLV University Libraries ensures that the perspectives of our region's Latinx residents are reflected in our collections so that present and future generations can learn and study more about their achievements, aspirations, and experiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This digital resource contains transcribed texts of handwritten documents, supplemented by contextual and explanatory apparatus, from Thomas Jefferson's papers. The main body of the content consists of the record of daily meteorological observations he maintained, with gaps, from July 1776 to June 1826. In this period Jefferson noted weather conditions at 99 locations, including his home in Virginia, Monticello; Paris, France; Philadelphia; and Washington, D.C.  The second category of source texts consists of other documents from Jefferson's papers that relate to weather or climate and take a variety of forms, including summary tables, descriptive notations, and graphs.</Abstract>

Not only will subsequent chapters (transcription and translations) be uploaded as they are completed but it is also hoped that future work on volume II of the Theologia Indorum (for a complete reconstruction of the entire text) may be added in the future, along with links to libraries that are currently scanning and making available online other manuscripts of this text.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mapping the Scottish Reformation (MSR) is a digital prosopography of the Scottish clergy between 1560 and 1689 that allows users to explore and visualize clerical careers during this essential period in Scottish history. Built with data from manuscripts held at National Records of Scotland (NRS), this is the first project to ever comprehensively chart the growth, movement, and networks of the Scottish clergy following the Reformation in 1560. For scholars and students of this era, such a resource provides crucial framing for inquiries into religious beliefs, political conflicts, and institutional change. For those interested in family history on both sides of the Atlantic, MSR offers unprecedented information on individuals whose outsized archival footprints make them critical figures for genealogical research.  This project started in 2017 with the Project Team's Directors Michelle D. Brock (W&amp;amp;L University) and Chris R. Langley (Newman University). This website reflects the findings of Stage 1 of the project, which focused on the diverse and important presbyteries in the Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. This stage was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Strathmartine Trust and supported by our wonderful Advisory Board and other generous collaborators. This pilot user interface was designed in collaboration with Hristo Meshinski, Stewart Cromar, and Ewan McAndrew of the University of Edinburgh.  We are in the process of expanding the scope of Mapping the Scottish Reformation; eventually, it will provide and visualize data on the careers of the clergy from all regions of Scotland. We welcome you to keep up with our progress on our blog and Twitter feed!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Darwin Manuscripts Project is a historical and textual edition of Charles Darwin's scientific manuscripts. Digital access to Charles Darwin's work includes over 96,000 pages of Darwin's scientific manuscripts as high-resolution digital images, nearly 10,000 of which have been transcribed and are publicly accessible. The aim of the Darwin Manuscript Project is to produce professional quality scholarly editions of Darwin's manuscripts. The project provides high-quality scanned images of Darwin's manuscripts and transcriptions indicating physical qualities of the text and instruments Darwin used to create them. The transcriptions also show the layering effect created by Darwin's revisions of his manuscripts (e.g. what he crossed out, wrote between lines, marginal notes, lettering and numbering intended to organize his manuscripts). Through these revisions the reader can reconstruct the history of a manuscript's creation by Darwin.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Charles Darwin's surviving scientific manuscripts—his original notes, notebooks, and drafts—contain the crucial documentary evidence for the birth and maturation of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. The Darwin Manuscripts Project (DMP) site offers digital access to the folios that deal directly with the theory of evolution, and contains Darwin’s botany and zoology manuscripts and embraces all those on human evolution. The site focuses on the surviving record of Darwin's life work as a practicing scientist. It is intended to be accessible to all who want to trace Darwin’s intellectual development as a theorist, observer, and experimenter. The key to understanding this science-focused collection is to realize that Darwin organized his rough manuscripts into large thematic portfolios. It was from these amassed materials that he shaped his published work, which include On the Origin of Species and fifteen other books.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Poll lists or original manuscript records of women voting in New Jersey in the Revolutionary era. The poll lists prove that at least 163 women and some people of color voted in the first generation after the Revolutionary War. The first in-depth analysis of nine poll lists by Museum researchers refutes any presumption that women in the Early Republic were only passive witnesses and bystanders of the political processes that shaped the new nation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Comparison of LISTENING PERSPECTIVE: Centralized Source with Close Listener (Proportional) in Music Row Recording Studio, Nashville, TN (left plan, below) vs. 19th-century Byzantine Revival Bank, Rochester, NY (right plan, below). This computational auralization is scaled for individual listening over headphones or earbuds. To create each auralization, a "dry", close-up recording of a mandolin (using one microphone, without acoustical context) was convolved with binaural/two-channel acoustical impulse responses as documented in the measurement session photographs below each site plan. Convolution is the name of a digital signal process that can be used to virtually locate one sound in another place, by mathematically combining audio (the mandolin recording) with measured data (the impulse response) from that space. How would you describe the differences and similarities of the sonic environments presented in these auralizations? How do you think the acoustical differences affect social interactions in these spaces during their intended uses? These are some of the social and historical questions that can be explored and tested using aural heritage data and auralization interfaces, for both researchers and public audiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>These are the materials provided to 4th grade teachers in Tompkins County to create a virtual visit to the 8 Square Schoolhouse, as a substitute for the in-person field trip. The virtual materials needed to be usable for zoom classrooms, as many of the participating classrooms continue to be entirely virtual.  The materials were distributed in a variety of different methods, depending on the security requirements of each school district. For NEH Access, we've created a shared drive with the 8 Square Schoolhosue materials. The link should provide access.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Storytelling is at the core of who we are as humans. It is how we learn, identify ourselves, and connect to others in the past, the present and the future. The intention of this exhibition is to record the diverse stories and life experiences of Muslim people living in Chicago in order to build connections in our communities through listening and understanding.   By sharing these stories, we aim to exhibit the vibrant Muslim communities in the city and suburbs, honor individual experiences and ensure that these personal stories will be preserved for future generations.   This exhibition draws from more than 100 interviews conducted with Muslim Chicagoans sharing their stories of faith, identity, and personal journeys. Dozens of objects from local individuals and organizations, such as garments, artwork, and photographs, as well as videos and interactive experiences expand on how and why Chicago is known as the American Medina.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2020, RBS responded to the pandemic by offering a varied series of free digital programs centered on bibliography and the history of the book. These programs focused on the study of textual artifacts and their crucial role in shaping understandings of cultural heritage and informing humanistic research. The offerings included five series: a Course-Related Content Series offered by RBS faculty members that will be available to students who were enrolled at RBS this summer in some cases and, in others, open to wider audiences; a Panel Discussion Series, featuring RBS faculty members and colleagues from the broader book community; a Young Book Lovers Series, designed to engage K-12 audiences as well as others new to the book; a Lecture Series, building off of RBS's traditional programming; and a BiblioVideo Series, highlighting pedagogy and research with textual artifacts.  This content, while not a substitute for Rare Book School's full courses, provided an opportunity to gather and pursue our shared love of learning what bibliographical materials reveal about human history and human nature, how to care for these remarkable objects, and how to share what we know with the wider world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awarded the HBCU Library Alliance a $365,000 one-to-one challenge grant for "The Building Capacity for Humanities Special Collections at Historically Black Colleges and Universities" project. The HBCU Library Alliance must raise $365,000 to fulfil the obligations of the challenge grant.   Building Capacity is a five-year program designed to build capacity for the long-term preservation and conservation of collections at each of the member libraries. Building Capacity will offer a menu of preservation planning documents, collection surveys, treatment and rehousing services, and educational programs to the member libraries. Through this outreach, the HBCU Library Alliance will assist the libraries in building capacity for fundraising for special collection initiatives, documenting cultural heritage materials, increasing accessibility of special collection items, and promoting the humanities significance of their broad collections of rare materials and their irreplaceable cultural heritage artifacts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We report upon the results of a research and prototype building project \emph{Worldly~OCR} dedicated to developing new, more accurate image-to-text conversion software for several languages and writing systems. These include the cursive scripts Farsi and Pashto, and Latin cursive scripts. We also describe approaches geared towards Traditional Chinese, which is non-cursive, but features an extremely large character set of 65,000 characters. Our methodology is based on Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning, and Data Science, and is directed towards vast quantities of original documents, exceeding a billion pages. The target audience of this paper is a general audience with interest in Digital Humanities or in retrieval of accurate full-text and metadata from digital images.</Abstract>

One video entitled "Image-to-text conversion for Farsi" illustrates the operation of a full implementation of the OCR pipeline on Farsi text (used as a proxy for Pashto, as at the time of creation we did not have the Pashto training data yet). The video demonstrates 97-98% accuracy on the level of characters.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>The trajectory of art history on Monhegan was forever changed when a group of New York City artists discovered the Monhegan muse after World War II. We explore the work of twelve artists who lived in New York in the winter, and spent summers on Monhegan Island.  They met at art school or through the Federal Art Project created during the Depression.  On Monhegan, they made up a large part of the post World War II art community,  choosing the island for its affordability, inspiration, and isolation. They shared close friendships, engaging in sketching groups, art critiques, and poker games with the year-rounders; but at the same time respected each other's need for creative space.  Together they contributed to the revitalization of the art colony on Monhegan Island in the mid-twentieth-century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The UA Little Rock Center for Arkansas History and Culture catalog contains thousands of digitized primary sources. We know searching a catalog for the perfect research or teaching materials can take a long time.  That's why we've done some of the work for you!  We've created a comprehensive list of all the primary sources we have digitized and made available in our online Catalog. The lists are easily searchable and downloadable and provide helpful information for identifying the materials, such as Title, Description, subjects/topics, and links to the catalog records.  Additionally, each primary source has been matched to the Arkansas Social Studies Standards to make it easier for K-12 teachers to identify relevant teaching materials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Complementing the two-volume print edition The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea (2019–21), edited by Jennifer Keith with Claudia Thomas Kairoff, the Anne Finch Digital Archive provides open access to selected materials. Both projects are edited by Jennifer Keith with Claudia Thomas Kairoff. Materials on the digital site enable readers to explore the archival elements used to construct and analyze Finch's texts. The featured poems on this site were selected from a great range and number in Finch's œuvre to illustrate her work in different poetic kinds and themes. For every featured poem, the site includes commentary with embedded links to illustrations, information about composition and printing dates and sources, audio files of the poem read aloud, and source copies showing authorized manuscript and print texts with transcriptions. We will continue to add resources to the site, including recordings of musical performances of the songs featured here. The multimedia elements of this site reflect the various ways that Finch's work engaged her contemporary readers and listeners, who knew her work in manuscript, print, or performance, or in all of these forms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Replacing electronic components can be a tricky task, but if you have the tools, training, and some practice it can be done by almost anyone!  As usual, the best way to get good at something is to do it with some guidance. BAVC has created this video workshop to walk through the process of soldering a simple PCB kit. The kit we used is a "xr2206 function generator" that can be purchased for under $15 from various online vendors. During this workshop, you'll learn how to solder and remove electrical components, how to test electrical components, and the basics of using an oscilloscope. This workshop was Produced by BAVC Preservation (https://bavc.org/preserve-media) with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Memory Lab at the DC Public Library.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During this workshop Morgan Morel, BAVC's Preservation Manager, will go over some of the main features and quirks of the unit, and then focus on one of the biggest hurdles to using the unit: The audio terminal blocks. Rather than having typical audio connectors like XLR or RCA, these units use audio terminal blocks. That means that in order to hook up the audio you'll need to strip wires and customize-build your own connectors. With the correct tools and some patience anyone can do it, and we are holding this workshop to give you what you need to utilize these units in your own preservation lab!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Norman Sicily Project (NSP) digitally registers, maps and analyzes the monuments erected during the island's Norman period (ca. 1061-1194), arguably the most auspicious years in its long history. In so doing, it provides new understandings of the complex society that produced them. The project accomplishes this by joining history and earth science in a collaboration made broadly accessible by digital technologies. Currently in prototype form, the web app offers access to an entire class of monuments - the society's monasteries - including images, geographic location, onomastic information, chronological data, types of attestation, gender, order, administrative rank, mother houses, dependencies, founders, dates of field visits, seismic region information and sustainability data. These data are made freely available to the public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Neatline is a geotemporal exhibit-builder that allows you to create beautiful, complex maps, image annotations, and narrative sequences from Omeka collections of archives and artifacts, and to connect your maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. Neatline lets you make hand-crafted, interactive stories as interpretive expressions of a single document or a whole archival or cultural heritage collection. You can import these documents (georeferenced historical maps, manuscripts, high-res photographs, etc.) from an existing collection, or create a new digital archive, yourself. Every Neatline exhibit is your contribution to humanities scholarship, in the visual vernacular.  The Scholars' Lab designed Neatline as a suite of plugins for the open-source Omeka framework, which provides a powerful platform for management and publication of the collection on which your exhibit is built. Through Neatline, you can create create rich representations of places, objects, events, narratives, and documents — like these demo exhibits.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Intertextual Hub is an experimental digital humanities reading environment that aims to situate specific documents in their broader context of intertextual relations, whether in the form of direct or indirect borrowings, shared topics with other texts or parts of texts, or other kinds of lexical similarity. Intuitively, we believe that he conceptual relationships discovered by text mining algorithms among texts in large, heterogeneous collections can fruitfully inform and guide traditional close-reading approaches. More fundamentally, our contention is that scholarly reading in the digital age—and the true usefulness of computational analysis of texts—should be foregrounded on the discovery and navigation of intertextual relationships. The model we have developed here allows users to navigate between individual and larger groups of texts that are related through shared themes, ideas, and passages. What the Intertextual Hub offers, then, along with the scalable reading tools, is an approach to federating collections that can bypass the various competing problems of quality (OCR vs. curated) and access (pay vs. public) inherent in digital collections today, and still yield meaningful results.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This website is organized around a body of 278 pre-Civil War American psalm and hymn tunes based on European classical music, most long since forgotten. All 278 tunes are gathered into a searchable "Anthology," in which each appears with a modern edition and a piano recording. But the website also includes — along with a range of essays and interpretive material — a growing "Choral Showcase" of recordings of tunes in the Anthology, as submitted by any and all interested choirs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ARCE with funding from NEH Foundations award digitised, described and published three pilot collections on ARCE Conservation Archives website. Further on ARCE hired a web developer agency, Notch8 based in San Diego, California to develop a front end interface for the website. ARCE shared the digital assets with UCLA Digital Library, to disseminate them on UCLA International Digital Ephemera Project website. UCLA Digital Library partners exposed ARCE's digital assets via an Open Archives Intitiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting to Notch8 backend and published on ARCE's Conservation Archives website.  The website went live on December 20, 2020 with more than 1,000 unique visitors and 8,900 total visits so far. ARCE has applied a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA), ensuring open access and free to use material to researchers and general public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The UCLA Library has launched an innovative and forward-looking initiative to capture ephemeral content with global partners. Through this project, UCLA Library endeavors to build international and global collections of knowledge and to preserve the historical and cultural record so that present and future generations can access and use ephemera that document the larger arena of discourse that takes place alongside mainstream media and scholarly publications.  NOTE: The IDEP website is not a grant product under NEH Foundations grant, but it became an integral part of it. The partnership between ARCE-UCLA Library, contributed to the succesful and sustainable completion of the project. This partnership enabled UCLA to harvest the NEH funded digitised collections from ARCE to their collections management system (Islandora) and expose them via OAI-PMH to ARCE's free access Conservation Archives website (funded by NEH Foundations grant) and make the assets discoverable online.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Philadelphia seamstresses like Betsy Ross and Rebecca Flower Young supported the Revolutionary War by making the large flags flown by privateers and navy ships at sea.   To highlight the global connections of the American Revolution, the Museum commissioned modern makers to create 14 large handmade flags replicating those that were flown by Revolutionary-era privateers and navy ships at sea.  The Museum debuted the flags on Flag Day Weekend in conjunction with Flags and Founding Documents, 1776-Today, which features more than 40 rare American flags alongside historic documents.    Onsite visitors interacted with the makers who recreated these early flags from countries like the United States, France, Britain, Spain, Portugal, and more, including handling the flags, trying their hand at sewing, and learning about historic textile work. Online visitors were able to follow the project's progress and take a closer look behind the scenes through the Museum's social media channels.  An activity guide for families was created for True Colours highlighting flags in the Museum's collection and flags on loan for the special exhibition, explaining how flags have been used as symbols for communication, and featuring fun activities.   The colorful flags were on display in the Museum's outdoor plaza from June 10-June 14 and again from June 28-July 5. The flags, which range in size from 7 x 10 ft., 5 x 7 ft, and 2 x 40 feet, are currently on display on the Museum's in-gallery privateer ship, where they are used as storytelling tools to bring history to life for visitors of all ages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The R.E.A.C.H. Initiative is a multi-year collaboration between the departments of Philosophy and Psychology at Salisbury University. The humanities are at the center of a needful rethinking of the purpose of undergraduate education at our institution, as well as the public mission of state-assisted universities. The R.E.A.C.H. Initiative brings together, via a slate of new curricular and co-curricular resources focused on Ethics, two major elements of institutional revision: (i) Curriculum change aimed at harmonizing professional training with early exposure to philosophical and research ethics, and (ii) Community-driven learning, where our immediate community has a say and a stake in the design of public-facing services, internships and programming.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Collection on Theatrical Broadsides is an artificial collection physically united by Morgen Stevens-Garmon, Associate Curator for the Theater Collection, in 2015, in order to better accommodate their continued preservation and access, and assess their conservation needs. As an artificial collection, the Collection on Theatrical Broadsides consists of objects from dozens of individual gifts donated to the Museum between 1928 and 1996. The majority of the material was donated either by audience members or collectors of theatrical memorabilia, few of whom had any connection to the professional theatrical world. Maintaining this material as an artificial collection based on subject matter allows for faster and more comprehensive organization and description, and is consistent with Museum practice in relation to its ephemera collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Discography of American Historical Recordings (DAHR) is a database of master recordings made by American record companies during the 78rpm era. It is part of the American Discography Project (ADP)—an initiative of the University of California, Santa Barbara and the Packard Humanities Institute that is edited by a team of researchers based at the UCSB Library.  DAHR is an expansion of the Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings (EDVR) incorporating previously published discographic data licensed from various publishers, folding them into the search and display framework of DAHR. Documentation of the activities of the Victor Talking Machine Company and RCA Victor derives primarily from consultation of publications of the companies and original documents held in the archives of Sony Music Entertainment in New York City. DAHR entries describing recordings made by Columbia Records, the Berliner Gramophone Co., OKeh Records, Zonophone Records, Leeds &amp;amp; Catlin Records, and Decca are based on authoritative published discographies, supplemented with new research, examination of recordings in the collections of the University of California Santa Barbara Library, and submissions from record collectors and archives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the AHA partnered with Fairleigh Dickinson University to develop and implement a national survey to assess public perceptions of, and engagement with, the discipline of history and the past. The 40-question survey explores the public's definition of the term "history," where audiences access history, which sources of history are perceived to be reliable, their historical learning experiences, attitudes toward historical revision, correlations between civic engagement and an interest in history, and the perceived value of history. The report provides as much survey data as possible for these topics, in a user-friendly format including over 150 charts illustrating our results. Complete raw survey data are available for download for those wanting to explore these topics in more depth.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Teaching Iowa History is a state-wide project led by the Iowa Museum Association to provide standard based instructional resources for the benefit of K-12 teachers which incorporate primary sources from public collections.  By incorporating primary sources into instructional resources, Teaching Iowa History raises awareness of the collections held in Iowa's museums and the importance of museums in preserving primary sources that inform the historical identity of Iowans, Iowa communities, and Iowa's role in the nation and world.    In the creation of instructional resources, Teaching Iowa History partners University of Northern Iowa, Simpson College, Graceland University, Iowa Public Television, and University of Iowa provide opportunities for pre-service teachers and museum educators to create lesson plans aligned with Iowa Social Studies standards using primary sources from the compiled database.  Teaching Iowa History seeks to bring Iowa's museums and schools into closer alignment and partnership, highlighting the role of museums as K-12 educational partners and life-long active, choice-driven learning environments.  Teaching Iowa History provides an opportunity for museums to increase accessibility through inclusion in the primary source database and instructional resources.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 1775 and 1850, most of the colonies in the Western Hemisphere declared and successfully won their independence from the European monarchies of Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, and France. This era of European and American history is generally thought to begin with the Revolutionary War to found the United States of America and end with number of European efforts for democratic reforms in 1848, and is often referred to as the "Age of Revolutions." In the American colonies formerly held by Spain and Portugal - what we now refer to as Latin America - colonists claimed independence in a series of military and political struggles between 1808 and 1825. White elites of Spanish descent in the colonies protested the demands and constraints of the imperial states, particularly the taxes and other economic burdens imposed by the colonial powers on their colonies, and the lack of opportunities in colonial administration. These complaints converged with ideas of Enlightenment thinkers about freedom, progress, and representative government, and the examples of the revolutions in the United States, France, and Haiti, to form independence movements. They also resonated with many members of oppressed and marginalized populations, including enslaved people, people of color, the Indigenous, the poor, and almost all women - many of whom joined the struggles for independence. By 1836, the former Latin American colonies of Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Bolivia had gained independence from Spain; Brazil from Portugal; and Uruguay from Brazil. That year, Spain formally renounced all claims to these lands. Cuba and Puerto Rico would remain Spanish colonies until the Spanish-American War of 1898; in the Dominican Republic, the fight for independence from Spain and from Haiti continued into the 1860s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>First Vote presents two case studies of the intersection of race and politics at an inflection point in American history: the arrival of African American voting following the ratification of the 15th Amendment to the US Constitution. The discovery of official polls books that preserve the votes of newly enfranchised African Americans and their white neighbors in two Kentucky counties—Garrard and Todd—enable us to follow black and white voters across multiple elections during the Reconstruction era. It reveals the political effects of network and neighborhood and shows where and how individual African Americans voted. It is a story of both political courage and cross-racial alliances, in which black men and white men in joined forces to create a new political majority in one case and, in the other case study, failed to do so.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the economic hard times of the 1930s, U.S. government art projects under the WPA (Works Progress Administration) and other agencies created a wealth of public art and supported art communities across the country. These projects had an enormous impact on American art and artists, but much of that history, particularly in the Northwest, where hundreds of artists were employed and thousands of artworks were created, has been unexplored. Organized by the Tacoma Art Museum, Forgotten Stories: Northwest Public Art of the 1930s offers an extensive overview of the bounty of work created in our region and brings forgotten treasures back to view.   From December 1933 to June 1943, the federal government sponsored a unique set of projects to support artists and create public artworks. The United States was suffering under a severe economic depression and millions were unemployed. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration created the New Deal—a host of programs designed to provide government jobs, from construction to office work. Through the advocacy of Eleanor Roosevelt and others, jobs for artists, musicians, actors, and writers were included.  The art projects abruptly ended when the U.S. entered World War II and many of the artworks and related records were lost or destroyed. Little was thought to have happened in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington (the government's Region 16). However, research now shows over 600 artists were employed, more than two thousand objects created, and hundreds of thousands of Northwest residents experienced or created their own original artworks. Forgotten Stories celebrates this important moment for public art in our region.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1986-1996, with the help of NEH funds, the Margaret Sanger Papers Project organized and microfilmed the Margaret Sanger papers in the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College and from other repositories. We organized, assembled the documents, and produced a state-of-the- art microfilm edition of over 60,000 papers and records divided into two series: the Smith College Collections and Collected Documents. The Margaret Sanger Papers Microfilm Edition (101 reels) was published in 1996 by University Publications of America. In 2018, Proquest digitized these two microfilm series and made them available online in its History Vault. The ProQuest History Vault provides access to millions of primary source, cross-searchable, full-text/full-image documents on the most widely studied topics in 19th and 20th-century American history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Speeches and Articles of Margaret Sanger (1911-1959), is a web-based edition of Sanger's writings, including articles, pamphlets, speeches, stories, and interviews, produced by The Margaret Sanger Papers Project (MSPP).  Unlike much of the historical material currently available on the Internet, this edition is a completely vetted, historically accurate digital version of her writings and speeches that conform to established standards, both in terms of technical features of its encoding, and providing accurate renderings of the texts. It provides open access to complete versions of those articles, speeches and statements, most frequently cited and those that are often inaccessible to general readers. In this digital edition, the Project seeks to make these documents much more accessible to researchers.  In a collection where there is so much material on a handful of subjects, readers may search documents by a date ranges, publication source, and type of document (speech, draft article, etc.), as well as by simple word. While such searches often return too many matches, they are invaluable for a researcher who wants to see each instance of Sanger's use of a word or term. A reader could search for the word "abortion" and go through each of them to get a sense of her views. However, in such a search will pick up not just discussions of abortion, but mere use of the word. In many instances Sanger simply said that birth control would reduce the frequency of abortions. To solve the problem of getting too many, often not relevant "hits" the Project has prepared a subject index. In the above example, this index will help generate fewer, but more relevant results.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Little Gidding harmonies are a remarkable set of religious books pasted together from the cut-up fragments of printed Bibles and engravings. They were made in England at the household of Little Gidding between 1630 and the early 1640s, mostly by the women of the extended Ferrar family. Together, they make up perhaps the largest extant collection of early modern English women's bookwork. On this website, you can view full editions of two gospel harmonies and one lavishly illustrated edition of Acts of the Apostles and Revelation. In addition, you can browse edited excerpts from a gospel harmony made for King Charles I and a pentateuch concordance made for his son Prince Charles. Each edition links the pasted fragments to their sources when known. You can also browse the library of source prints used to make each concordance and, from there, see how these engravings were cut to make the harmonies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This website, built using Digital Mappa, is a digital edition of Susanna Collet's commonplace book, completed circa 1635. It was possibly made as a present for her daughter, Joyce Collet.

		<Abstract>The GWFPP exists at the intersection of two challenges editors currently face: managing complicated editorial work and navigating the world of digital publication. The project focuses on a particularly difficult and dynamic dataset—financial documents. Work has advanced on three interconnected fronts: 1) developing document templates for both traditional financial documents, such as account books and ledgers, and for more esoteric texts, including receipts, journals, and memoranda; 2) developing taxonomies and data visualizations; and 3) constructing an open-source platform for content management, editing, and publication. In the course of tackling these challenges, the project has not only developed an open-access digital edition of GW's, but also laid the groundwork for a Drupal for Editors prototype. This Drupal-based, open-source, editorial/publication platform will provide editors with a stable, flexible, and powerful platform to build engaging digital editions of financial documents.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Videographic Essay is a collection of writings about and examples of videographic criticism, edited by Christian Keathley, Jason Mittell, and Catherine Grant. As an open access, multimodal site of scholarship, this site will evolve over time, expanding the collection of examples and revising writing as relevant. Earlier versions of some of these writings were published in 2016 and 2019 by caboose books in the volume The Videographic Essay: Criticism in Sound &amp;amp; Image.   This material emerged from ‘Scholarship in Sound &amp;amp; Image,' three workshops on videographic criticism that were hosted at Middlebury College in June 2015, 2017, and 2018; since 2019, the workshop has continued as part of Middlebury College's Digital Liberal Arts Summer Institute. The three original workshops were funded by two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities program.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Georgia Open History Library (GOHL) includes open-access digital editions of single-authored scholarly titles and two multivolume series, comprising almost fifty individual volumes in history and primary documents. The open text library was generously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities in anticipation of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States in 2026. Our title selection, not surprisingly, focuses on the colony and eventual statehood of Georgia and its relationship with other groups, colonies, countries, and the new Union. It includes studies of Adams and Jefferson; the American Revolution in Georgia; the Creek Nation; the papers of Revolutionary War general Lachlan McIntosh and the colony's visionary founder James Edward Oglethorpe; and records of the German-speaking Protestant Salzburger settlement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2026, the United States will mark the 250th anniversary of its founding. In anticipation of this event, the University of Georgia Press has developed the Georgia Open History Library: From Colony to Statehood in the New Union. This resource provides free digital access to the 45 out of print volumes focused on Georgia from the colony's founding through the American Revolution in Georgia; the Creek Nation; the papers of Revolutionary War General Lachlan McIntosh and the state's founder James Edward Oglethorpe; and records of the German-speaking Protestant Salzburger settlement. This digital exhibit showcases a selection of original manuscripts and rare books held by the Hargrett Library documented in these newly digitized volumes. A physical exhibit of these materials is currently on display at the UGA Special Collections Building; high resolution scans and transcriptions of these documents can be found in the Digital Library of Georgia.</Abstract>

These include 78-rpm recordings produced for immigrant, ethnic, and indigenous audiences by American companies in the first half of the 20th century; and more than 700 hours of original field and home recordings from the 1950s through the 1990s featuring the Upper Midwest's culturally diverse traditional musicians. Captured in kitchens and parlors, in churches and halls, amidst festivals and in professional studios, this online collection presents dance tunes, ballads, lyric songs, hymns, laments, political anthems, and recitations, together with extensive interviews of many performers.  The collection offers:      Full audio streams, whenever possible     Photographic images     Field notes     Tape Indexes     Translations of titles</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1920 Ferdinand Ingold, a poor but visionary Swiss settler in the small Wisconsin town of Monroe, audaciously launched a record label, Helvetia—invoking his homeland's ancient name and celebrating its musical heritage. Praised in the immigrant press yet beset by fiscal challenges, Helvetia issued a scant 36 sides. Scattered, scarce, and nearly forgotten, Ingold's entire catalog, newly restored and remastered, is offered here. Rollicking and somber, sentimental and lusty, these Swiss, German, and Tyrolean tunes and songs feature virtuoso instrumental combos, vocal quartets, and especially yodelers from Swiss communities in New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin. A 60-page booklet by folklorist Jim Leary, richly illustrated with rare images, offers extensive background on the label, performers, and each track, along with bilingual lyrics unlocked by a team of translators tackling dialectical challenges. Illuminating one of the first American record labels established by an immigrant for his own community, Alpine Dreaming both recalls a bygone era and resonates with all who seek better New World lives while remembering their homelands.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume of Adams Family Correspondence spans the tumultuous period May 1798 through September 1799 and chronicles in 288 documents an important period in John and Abigail Adams's public life, as well as John Quincy Adams's diplomatic career. With relations with France teetering on the brink of war and deepening divisions within the Federalist party at home, John Adams's presidency was fraught with tension. Abigail Adams served as his trusted confidant and advisor and wielded her public power to aid her husband's administration. From Europe, the couple's eldest son, John Quincy Adams, sent vital reports home on conditions abroad. The letterpress volume was published in 2017, and it was converted to the Adams Papers Digital Edition and made freely accessible to the public in June 2021.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Americorps VISTA staff member Genesis Ranel researched, planned and implemented a virtual field trip program to allow access to the museum for school children during pandemic conditions, with the goal of also allowing students outside of easy field trip distance to access the museum. The virtual tour includes lesson plans and teacher resources and interviews with former incarcerees as well as a livestreamed tour of museum facilities. By the end of the grant period, the virtual field trip had completed a live test with a group of young adults. In addition, we have paid for a license to stream the short film A Flicker in Eternity, which is a standard film used in on-site school tours.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ma?ayin is the result of a six-year collaboration between Kluge-Ruhe and Indigenous knowledge holders from the Buku-Larr?gay Mulka Centre in northern Australia. It chronicles the rise of a globally significant art movement as told from the perspective of the Yol?u people. Ma?ayin presents more than 90 iconic paintings on eucalyptus bark, inviting audiences across the US to discover this inspiring story of the sacred, the beautiful, and the power of art.   "Ma?ayin: Eight Decades of Aboriginal Australian Bark Painting from Yirrkala" is organized by the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection in partnership with the Buku-Larr?gay Mulka Centre, Yirrkala. It opens at the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth in September 2022.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Zotero (https://www.zotero.org/) shared library served to provide a curated set of references for Fellows about various geospatial technologies of interest as they pertain to spatial archaeology and/or the digital humanities more widely. Fellows were provided with an email invitation to join the group library for free. References to articles, book chapters, books, and other online materials included DOIs, URLs, and, for some of the most pertinent resources, pdfs that were uploaded to the library. A core set of references (curated by Limp and others) offers foundational texts and case studies, and important workflows that remain relevant. These References include searchable tags such as "3D data," "LiDAR," and "Digital Humanities" so that Fellows can browse through relevant titles efficiently. Klehm added a Recent Articles subfolder focusing on case studies from the past five years, with pdf provided (if the journal was behind a paywall) or links if open-source. Recent Articles seeks to keep Fellows abreast of the most recent scholarship on various topics within digital archaeology, knowing again that it may have been several years since some Fellows last took GIS and remote sensing courses (and to provide perhaps a broader set of case studies than one may have looked at as a Mayan scholar working in Belize, for example).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>n response to Covid 19, the Kingston Chamber Music Festival went online for the 2020 season with the extraordinary assistance of Swan Studios in NYC. We recorded our six festival concerts and aired them via our website in August/September 2020. The festival was an early adopter of online programming during the pandemic. People were hungry for any type of performance at that point, and the festival videos were viewed over 3000 times. As we shifted to online concerts, we realized the importance of making our website more engaging for viewers since it would be their "concert hall," and we invested in a redesign of our website. Once the website was completed, we realized that our program notes, previously provided in printed format only, seemed heavy and out-of-sync with what was needed to appeal to on-line viewers. The format for the notes had been the same for many years; they were dense and focused primarily on the musicality of each piece. While festival staff recognized that more engaging notes would encourage viewers to watch the concerts as well as inform them about the music, the festival did not have the time or resources to redesign the program notes for the 2020 season.  We were determined to make the shift for 2021, particularly when it became clear that the festival would need to deliver its concerts online for a second season.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is our attempt to convert 416 plans - 416 thumbnail sketches of towns as they existed two centuries ago - into usable historical knowledge. This might sound overly ambitious. After all, the plans have their limits. They do not describe every town in the empire. Some of the towns they describe no longer exist. They barely scratch the surface of how any one town looked - let alone what life there might have been like. They are clearly more concerned with an idealized future steeped in notions of rationality and productivity than with capturing the messy nuances of reality. Those gridded blocks and neat lines? They are nothing more than a glorious act of imagination.   But if you want to know where the breweries or butcheries were (or were supposed to be), this is a good place to start. If you want to know whether small and large towns had (or were intended to have) similar layouts, or what rivers might have had to do with Russian's urban fabric, the plans have a lot to tell us.  "Urban Legends" provides 1) access to hundreds of town plans, a subset of which have been partially or fully annotated (in most cases the annotations translate legend information from Russian into English); 2) access to a set of data visualizations built on the textual and graphic data extracted from the plans. It is a resource for teaching and for research into Russian urban history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With CARES Act Funding, the Guam Preservation Trust produced 10 instructional stories of 10 of Guam's historic sites delivered in the CHamoru language. A virtual fieldtrip was produced for each site including a song and melody in order to increase the effectiveness of the instruction and delivery directly advancing the mission of Guam Preservation Trust. Specifically, the program supported the goal of increasing appreciation of historic sites, learning and hearing of new stories of the site in the CHamoru langauge, and increasing knowledge and rethinking of how historic sites and songs associated with them can help preserve an indigenous language.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Bedford/Fairhaven Fishing Community was a year-long effort to digitize the cultural heritage of New Bedford’s fishing community. The project was a collaboration involving the New Bedford Fishing Heritage Center, University Archives and Special Collections at the University of Massachusetts Boston, Clair T. Carney Library at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, MIT Sea Grant, New Bedford Free Public Library, and New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park. The project centered around a day-long digitizing event. The event is typically held in a public space, generally a local public library, historical society or community center. This Digitizing Day Handbook is intended to serve as a guide for community groups to organize such events.</PrimaryURLDescription>
