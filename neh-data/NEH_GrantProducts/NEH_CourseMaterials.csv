443,RZ-50988-09,"This course compares and contrasts the respective ""philosophies of mind"" of the moderate realist Thomas Aquinas (ca. 1225-1274) and the nominalist John Buridan (ca. 1300-1361). Since Buridan knew, understood and respected, but respectfully disagreed with, Aquinas' doctrine, the discussions focus especially on Buridan's deviations from and criticisms of Aquinas' characteristic theses and arguments concerning the Aristotelian doctrine of the soul (such as the unity of substantial forms, the distinction of the powers of the soul, the co-formality of object and subject in intentional reception, the role of intelligible species in concept formation, the provability of the immateriality of the intellect, etc.) to find out exactly where Buridan's nominalist Aristotelianism parts company with Aquinas' consistent hylomorphism, why it does so, and whether with good reason. Also discussed is how Buridan's ideas prepared the ground for many recalcitrant dilemmas of modern philosophies of mind, quite justifiably invalidated by Aquinas' approach (dualism vs. materialism; freedom vs. determinism; representationalism vs. direct realism; externalism vs. internalism, etc.). The basic texts used are Aquinas' ""Questions on the Soul"" and ""Commentary on Aristotle's De Anima"", and the critical text and English translation of books II and III of Buridan's ""Questions on Aristotle's De Anima"", being prepared by an international team in the framework of an NEH-funded project (for more info, see: http://buridanica.org).

We are planning to strike a balance between giving an overview of recent philosophical developments and talking about our own work in progress. We will begin the semester with a discussion of recent work on grounding, followed by a detailed look at a number of more specific question about the grounding relation, e.g. about its formal properties, whether facts about grounding are fundamental, and the relationship between grounding and real definition. Next, we will focus on a specific question about fundamental reality, namely whether all fundamental facts are qualitative, or whether they include facts about which specific individuals exist and how the different qualitative roles are distributed over them. We will consider the commitments, attractions and drawbacks of different possible positions on this issue. This discussion will illustrate the connections between fundamentality and reduction on the one hand and supervenience on the other. That, in turn, will serve as an introduction to our next topic: the connection between hyperintensional and modal notions. Most likely, we will discuss the thesis—propounded by Kit Fine, among others—that modal distinctions can be explained in terms of essence. We will end the seminar by looking briefly at a few other hyperintensional notions, such as truth-making and constitution.",Graduate,"Shamik Dasgupta, Boris Kment",,,,,Hyperintensional Metaphysics,2010

2279,FN-50065-10,"Face-to-face interaction in multimodal contexts involves the integration of linguistic constructions, voice qualities, gestures and gesticulation, eye gaze, as well as other embodied actions relevant to the ongoing discourse.  Cross-cultural and cross-linguistic comparison of talk in interaction raises methodological concerns about just what is comparable across different ethnographic contexts, as well as what means researchers have to recognize actions as socially relevant to the flow of discourse when our own speaker-intuitions are not a viable source of knowledge.  In this course we will survey theoretical literature on multimodal interaction and cross-cultural conversation analysis, and build analytical skills working with video data through a focus on less-commonly studied languages recorded in their natural discourse settings.  Skills will involve tools for video editing, transcription, and the discourse coding of both verbal and non-verbal semiotic actions.  Laboratory ""data sessions"" will be conducted throughout the term in which class participants will hone analytical skills through the formulation and testing of hypotheses grounded in the turn-by-turn sequences of the transcribed video data.  Requirements are engagement of course readings, active participation in class discussions and data sessions, write-ups of data session findings, and a term project that can involve a student's own data or data from archived sources.  This course provides you with tools and experience working with interaction data different from your own language and culture and methods for productive comparison across the typological and cultural variability of the world's languages.",K - 12,Mark A.

In this course we will seek intellectual nourishment at the banquet of Dante's legacy by closely examining a broad range of responses to the poet—the man and his works—from Giovanni Boccaccio's biography in the late Middle Ages to Roberto Benigni's recent performances of TuttoDante. Between the Dante-inspired works of Boccaccio and Benigni, we will study various, often conflicting, versions of ""Dante"" in literature, art, film, politics, history, and popular culture. After establishing a foundation for Dante's influence by discussing his political treatise (Monarchia) and selected cantos of his Commedia (most from Inferno), we will embark on an interpretive journey tracing Dante's evolution from a regional to a national (then nationalist) figure before he attained the global status he enjoys today. Giuseppe Mazzini famously called Dante—Ugo Foscolo's ""Ghibelline fugitive""—the ""Prophet of the Italian Nation"": we will accordingly examine appeals to Dante's authority in promoting the liberation and unification of Italy, but we will also consider his role as a beacon of liberty in the United States. Among other areas of inquiry, we will discuss Catholic interpretations of Dante as a neo-Guelph advocate of papal political power, nationalist appropriations of the poet for territorial expansion and military interventions, and recent representations of Dante as an icon of Italian culture on the world stage.",K - 12,Guy Raffa,,,,,Dante's Afterlives,2013

The Interpretive Plan also states the desired learner outcomes (DLOs) we hope will be achieved by visitors at each station, and, where the experience is interpreter-guided as opposed to self-guided, provides suggestions for visitor participation opportunities (VPOs) and dialogue&#x0D; questions in some of the stations.&#x0D; &#x0D; The Interpretive Plan does not attempt to cover all the information that is needed for the effective presentation of Montgomery Place's themes.

Until vaccines, public health interventions, and then antibiotics helped us gained control over the major global infectious diseases, epidemics and pandemics were a fact of life. The most severe pandemic in human history was the Black Death, which struck Afroeurasia towards the end of the Middle Ages. Although total (absolute) mortality would be higher from the 1918-19 flu or the current HIV/AIDS pandemics, as a percentage of population the mortality from the Black Death (estimated between 40 and 60% in many areas) is the highest of any large-scale catastrophe known to humankind. Which makes it disconcerting that we still know so little about it. For example, while its demographic impact in western Europe and parts of the Middle East and North Africa is well known, we still know virtually nothing about its impact in Central Asia (where the microorganism, Yersinia pestis, evolved around 3000 or more years ago) or other parts of Eurasia; it may have even affected parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

5040,AC-50204-14,"Increased concern for the emotional component of doctoring has led to a revival in medical schools' inclusion of the humanities into their curriculum.  With the intention of fostering empathy, many medical schools offer reflective writing as a 3rd-year selective.  Although this has shown some positive outcomes, reflective writing requires complex writing skills that many students lack. Educators may assume that students can write easily and fluently about their emotions, but such writing is a skill, not a given.  Brief and late writing interventions limit success to those already inclined to the activity.  Further, by focusing solely on empathy, such programs ignore the potential power of writing as a multifaceted cognitive tool. This paper will present an ongoing curriculum intervention that is aimed at fully exploiting the potential of writing to develop observational, analytical, and other cognitive skills. The program we designed, a 3-year writing program for medical students, fully integrates writing into the curriculum.  This mandatory program introduces an innovative writing technique called Powerwriting to first-year students, when they use it as they learn patient documentation.  During their second and third years, students use writing toward recognizing biases and long-term consequences of treatment plans.  By the third year, all students are ready to use Powerwriting to reflect on difficult events, such as the deaths of patients.  Moving in a scaffolded curriculum, from information processing to critical analysis to reflective exploration, our approach gives students a powerful writing tool for processing all kinds of information, from humanistic to medical.   &#x0D; ",Other,Goldberry Long,http://mednarratives.com/research/syllabi-medical-narrative-in-humanities-social-sciences-and-arts/,All syllabi developed with support of the NEH can be found at this site.,,,Powerwriting for Medical Students,2014

How did the modern apparatus of the U.S./Mexico border come to be?  What are the cultural practices, social understandings, and forms of economic traffic that both contribute to its enactment of national division and difference, and are in turn regulated by its legal enforcement of political inclusion and exclusion? And how might we fashion a critical dialogue that best negotiates enduring problems of democracy and difference, freedom and security, and regional autonomy within a transnational and multiethnic space that yet belongs to an increasingly integrated and borderless world?  Examining historical clusters of texts that intersected public and private realms from the early 17th Century to the 21st Century, students will gain insight into these matters by investigating the multiple practices of social definition and political enforcement, national myth-making, and cultural boundary inscription that have contributed collectively to the construction of borderlands discourse over time.  Guiding and informing this endeavor will be the development of an intellectual repertoire of critical methods through close engagement with a host of theoretical texts preponderantly from beyond the strict purview of literary and cultural studies as such, but which promise to foster sophisticated understandings of the traffic between varieties of cultural and political representation, including epic poetry, literary fiction, oral storytelling, government documents and treaties, travel narratives, diaries, letters, visual art, and film.",Graduate,Robert Gunn,,,,,Mapping the Line: Cultural Representations of Borderlands Security,1915

Borderlands, whether historic or contemporary, have relied on various forms of legal logic to underpin their existence. This course looks at the laws, assumptions, and consequences of legal rulings in creating borders, classes and citizens. First, ""Discourses of Displacement"" will explore the idea of ""borders"" as a method that will allow us to explore new perspectives on the process of nation-building.   We will question how the idea of borders invites us to reassess political concepts of citizenship, sovereignty, and the function of law as an equitable social mechanism.  Lastly, we will simultaneously explore representations in literature and film of borders challenge us to reexamine our ideas about justice, citizenship, and the precariousness of national identity",Graduate,Lowry Martin,,,,,"Discourses of Displacement: Citizenship, Sovereignty and Dissolution",2015

The dividing line was created following the US-Mexico War and the signing of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. As border scholars have argued, however, border making does not end with the creation of a border line. During the time period covered by this class, the border shifted from a relatively open border to one increasingly surveilled and controlled. Immigration laws such as the 1917 Immigration Act, the 1924 creation of the Border Patrol, and the implementation of operations such as Operation Hold the Line in 1993 and Operation Gatekeeper in 1994 hardened the borderline. Yet, unequal economic developments, US federal policies, as well as political and social instability have continued to motivate on-going movement across the border.

One of the issues with survey courses is the inevitable generalizing because of time constraints that lead to a superficial presentation of content and analysis. One approach is to include unifying forms and theories to explore multiple historical theater forms and practices. Concepts and constructs of nationalism and its relationship to identity can provide a framework for examining how the stage and scripts support a study and critique of national cultures and identity. All cultures present and represent their history and values in performance. Disruptions of notions of history or cultural and social mores are also often performed, for example, in dada or intercultural performance.  An exploration of significant scripts and theatrical periods and styles, reflecting multiple styles of performance in South Asia, will contribute to student's understanding of the history and culture of particular regions and groups. These studies will also introduce students to conflicts and issues, both historical and current, in South Asia. Additionally, students will increase their understanding of the relationship of theatrical practices and genres historically and in intercultural performance.",Undergraduate,"Faculty: Peggy Mecham, Associate Professor of Theater",,,,,Module Title: Nationalism and Theater in South Asia,2016

It is an excellent way to bridge cultures in a course designed to improve ESL students' writing, reading and critical thinking skills. An arranged marriage is a custom that is not understood by many people across the globe. It is important for students to examine the custom of arranged marriages because it helps them to understand the values, beliefs and practices of people who come from other cultures. It helps them to understand the concept of marriage from a broader perspective and communicate empathetically with people from other cultures. The students will learn how to write reaction papers, conduct a debate, write a persuasive essay, and a critical analysis essay about the topic. They will read chapters about arranged marriages, view recent films, video clips and read a novel.

To assist students to these ends, I have chosen the topic of violence and its variants: pacifism, non-violent direct action, etc. Students are assessed primarily through two research papers which they draft and complete. The first explores the social and psychological origins of violent behavior. The second asks whether violence (or non-violence) continues to be useful as an agent of social change. I have therefore written two modules pertaining to South Asian materials for this course. The first revisits the idea of non-violence as understood by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The second looks at the uses and regrets which attend violent action in the Indian epic The Mahabharata.

Expanded Course Description: In medieval and early modern Europe, Christian church music conveyed religious doctrine and often political messages by painting texts with sound, dramatizing liturgical movement or filling space, evoking devotion, memories, or emotions, and mirroring heaven, or hell. Often regulated and mostly fixed in writing (after ca 850), religious liturgical music was usually performed by professionals and taught or composed only by the best of those initiated in that art, even though most levels of society heard it. In this course, we explore Christian music in selected European cities, from 700-1700. We will identify the music heard by different religious communities and social classes, in spaces including cathedrals and parish churches, court and private oratories, monasteries and convents, and guild chapels and hospitals. Particular emphasis will be given to the place and purpose of liturgical music, its ever evolving and changing nature, and the economy of music as demonstrated by the practices of lay benefaction.

The minor will explore ways of thinking, researching and writing about the diverse experiences of African-Americans and human culture — such endeavors at an HBCU are often more limited in the curricular sense.  The new minor seeks to extend African American history and liberal arts, formally into the architecture curriculum through new humanities offerings – and in so doing, provide a more focused historical perspective for students' current educational and professional trajectories.  The minor will be discipline specific to architecture and seeks to integrate humanities approach into the professional training of architects and builders.  Unlike many historical arguments, this minor goes beyond documenting educational inequities and offers an alternative curriculum that will advance diverse issues and inclusiveness in architecture and humanities education.   The product of the worksop will be the development of three new architecture course syllabi for classes beginning fall 2018.

How have critical art practices tested the categorically self-contained boundaries of art by asking challenging questions about art's purpose in the world, its separation from everyday life, its anti-instrumentality, or its ability to intervene in the politics of representation? The task of this course is two-fold: to both map some key post-war interventionist art practices and to query the conceptual parameters of what constitutes a ""critically engaged"" art practice.

In order to improve understanding about patients' perspectives of health and illness, their stories must be reclaimed from the diagnostic lists and treatments that dominate patient identities. As medical schools begin to select students based not only on their scientific acumen but also their understanding of the humanities, they are recognizing what Rita Charon (2008) states: Along with their growing scientific expertise, doctors need the expertise to listen to their patients, to understand as best they can the ordeals of illness, to honor the meanings of their patients' narratives of illness, and to be moved by what they behold so that they can act on their patients' behalf (p. 3). In addition to aiding in their treatment of patients, narrative medicine offers a means for medical practitioners to reflect on difficult cases by exploring their emotions and personal challenges in a career that is marked by significant stress (Roscoe, 2012).

As is well known, there are problems, generated by various paradoxes, the most famous being the Liar. We will discuss, among other things, Tarski's original approach and how it might be extended. The relevance of Gödel's work, and alternative ways of looking at the (first) Gödel incompleteness theorem. And, of course, my own work in this area, which in addition to a treatment of truth, mentions some other ways of looking at the Gödel incompleteness theorem. I also hope to discuss the relevance of various fixed points and alternative valuation schemes. In addition, the view, advocated by Yablo and others, that Truth Tellers ought to be definitely false, not indeterminate, and how this might be developed in my own approach.

In the 1970s this consensus disappeared, and it is now more generally held that an appropriate solution should accommodate a language with its own truth predicate. How that should be done is, of course, another matter.  In this course, we will be reading and discussing a number of papers that deal with that issue from a variety of different perspectives.

Art and labor became more prominent in the nineteenth century as rural society rapidly transformed into urban culture. Scenes of rural laborers such as farmers, fishermen, or workers were often received as nostalgic views of by-gone eras. Artists such as Impressionists in nineteenth-century Paris discovered images of urban workers such as shop keepers, street vendors, or railroad workers. At the same time, the genre of spectacle was being invented in industrial machines, steel and glass buildings, or newly renovated urban boulevards. In this class, we will visit a diverse range of special exhibitions held in New York City or elsewhere and think about how art (or artists) is intertwined with the creation of spectacles or spectacular new experiences at the expense of hard labor, visible or invisible.",Undergraduate,Kyunghee Pyun,,,,,"Art in New York: Art, Spectacle, and Labor",2019

What do you expect will happens in terms of job security, opportunities for promotion, wage increases, co-worker and customer relations? b) using the fashions created by the designers in the films/TV series, create two separate business models,:  one that you would believe would be successful in the time period in which the show/film is based, and one for today.

We will ask questions about who made books and other documents, how they were designed, who used them, and how they were used. These lines of inquiry (producer, design, user, and function) are closely intertwined: understanding the purpose of a book or document can help us decode its design and even the words on a page – and vice versa. This course will cover all aspects of manuscript production, dissemination, readership and reception, and ownership. The focus will be on Latinate manuscripts of Western Europe, but we will give you the tools to approach manuscripts across a range of cultures and languages.  While exploring the context of medieval manuscripts, the course will provide a practical grounding in the terms and practices of manuscript description and transcription, covering paleography (the history of scripts), codicology (the study of the material and physical history of the book), decoration, and diplomatics (the study of official documents).",Undergraduate,Anna Siebach Larsen,,,,,Manuscript Studies,2020

The story we tell here is in the elegiac mode: how cultures failed and their artifacts disappeared, how fabled texts and records were lost and forgotten, and how, with effort and ingenuity, a paltry few were clawed back from oblivion. From Europe to the Middle East, Asia to Latin America, an unsung group of scholars, adventurers, scientists, and rogues trekked across deserts and over mountains, plundered tombs and monasteries, rummaged between the legs of mummies, entered hidden caves and bricked up rooms, deciphered lost languages, and developed new technologies all so as to recover for the world a group of texts that would change the history of the past. That is if anyone actually bothered to read them.  Here is the history of the hidden canon, great yet little-known books drawn from far-flung collections: Monte Cassino, Verona, Herculaneum, the Fayum, Dura Europos, Ras Sharma, St. Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai, the Cairo Genizah, the Qumran caves, Khotan, Dun Huang, Chichen Itza, and Guatemala City. Its cast of characters includes the famous, the flamboyant, and the obscure: Petrarch, Poggio, Flinders Petrie, Grenville and Hunt, Solomon Schechter, Marcus Aurelius Stein, Zelia Nutall, Brasseur, Alexander von Humboldt, Konstantin Tischendorf, the Smith sisters.

Our focus will be on the way these manuscripts, and the authors and artists who created them, construct notions of aesthetic space and narrative time. Supplementing primary readings in Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, will be secondary theoretical readings by Cennini, Vasari, Alberti, Lessing, and Camille. Beyond literature and art, this course will also consider the problems of conservation of medieval manuscripts and early books, and their availability for a larger audience with the employment of digital technologies.

How should we regard the wishes of patients who are chronically sick, slowly losing cognitive function, or even terminally ill? If the confrontation with one's own mortality is, to a large degree, a personal issue, then how should we understand patient pain and suffering? While it is true that end-of life issues raise significant questions about the purpose and limits of scientific research, they also introduce equally important questions about what we can claim ethically about someone else's confrontation with mortality. For this reason, students will be challenged to move beyond both dogmatic scientific claims and abstract ethical arguments.

In this course we will look closely at both formats, putting these into their historical and cultural contexts. We will also think through how these materials were designed for their broad and largely literate audiences. By engaging a wide range of materials, we will consider how the goals for printed materials varied from transferring information to delineating artistic trends. Among the topics we'll study are: the early forms of woodblock printing; the development of full-color multiple block printing; popular subjects, from kabuki actors to erotica; the book as medium of transfer of painting practices; and the role of tradition in a modern world.  In considering this larger world of print, we will seek to understand how savvy publishers provoked and sated the appetites of their audiences by marketing writers and illustrators—along with many of their subjects—as brand names, even turning some into celebrities. These multi-market publishing ventures appeared as both inexpensive diversions, to be consumed and discarded, while others were designed for elite audiences, using high quality materials, techniques, and references. Publishers also dabbled in job printing in the form of producing high end works on commission for poetry groups, fan clubs, and others. In the modern era, these practices of the past were adapted by publishers, artists, and writers to serve their new markets.

How could we design digital methods and tools that reconstruct historical images like these in 3D even if they don't correspond to modern ideas about mathematical perspective or gridded Cartesian space?  For several decades, scholars of historical cartography have heeded the call to ""deconstruct the map""— to treat maps not as representations of the world as it was but as texts, which employ symbols, rhetoric and silences to make arguments about the world as the mapmaker wants it to be seen. Meanwhile, historians, literary scholars and others have applied computational analytics and machine learning to raise new questions about texts through techniques like text mining, XML encoding and data analytics. Bringing these two insights together, how might we ""read"" maps computationally without altering them to fit the constraints of machine readability?   This course, laid the foundations for students to begin to answer these questions, with a critical focus on the maps, views, and plans of medieval and early modern London and Lisbon. It offered an introduction to materials in the history and theory of cartography, medieval and early modern urbanization, and research methods in history, art history, architectural history and others, as well as critical approaches to digital mapping, procedures of map annotation and markup, Python-based techniques for importing markup data and procedural modeling (Houdini), incorporation of those data into an interactive 3D environment (Unreal), and preliminary analysis of these findings.

This course centers on how digital technologies for various forms of spatial thinking, modeling, and visualizing offer both powerful forensic tools and effective forms of public communication. Using as a starting point the current research trajectory of investigations in the ancient Greek Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace, this course aims to acquaint students with the fundamental digital tools of spatial analysis and offer the opportunity to work directly with each technology. A key objective is to enable students to make knowledgeable choices about which strategies and technologies most effectively address particular research or visualization questions.

The fame of the windswept, mile-high island of Samothrace in the northeastern Aegean emanated from its mystery cult of the Great Gods, whose rites of initiation promised protection at sea and the opportunity to ""become a better and more pious person in all ways"" (Diodorus).  Although the rites were kept secret, we can gain a purchase on their transformative power through the comments of ancient authors, the lists of initiates who left their names in the sanctuary, the innovative architecture that sheltered the rituals, the splendid dedications offered to the Gods, and the humble but crucial detritus of cult—pottery and animal bones—that built up over centuries of use spanning from the 7th century BC to the 4th century AD.  The Sanctuary of the Great Gods thus provides a key point of access into the religious, political, and cultural forces that reshaped the visual terrain of the Hellenistic world.  Students will gain hands-on experience working with the archaeological material in our research portfolio and have the opportunity to work with an array of computer programs used to manage, model, reconstruct, and share this remarkable place on earth.",Graduate,B.

Issues to be addressed include: the representation and reassessment of late Ming entertainment culture--courtesans, actors, storytellers, musicians, booksellers, painters; metatheatricality; memory and commemoration; props and material culture; the dissemination of news and (mis)information; the reenactment of the past on the stage, as we contextualize Peach Blossom Fan within the early Qing literary and theatrical world in which it was created and performed.

Greek clay vessels: How on earth did ancient Greeks construct pottery kilns capable of reaching 950º Celsius (1740º Fahrenheit)?!  What did they burn for fuel?  How were clay vessels thrown, glazed, and fired?  ?  The quarrying and transport of marble and other stones in the ancient world: How were these massive blocks weighing many tons (!) extracted from the ground, hauled over land, rafted up and down rivers, loaded onto ships, shipped hundreds of miles across the Mediterranean, and transported to workshops and construction sites?  How were these logistics of transport socially and culturally embedded?  What role did slavery and the military play?  ?  Tools: Ancient sculptors used pickaxes and marble saws, chisels and drills, abrasives and waxes.  How did they even manage to carve marble — let alone granite (!) — without steel tools or modern power?  What were the fundamental differences between Greek, Roman, and Egyptian approaches to the carving process?  ?  And what about Greek bronze statues?

Most people are aware of ancient Egypt in a very specific way, their knowledge guided by the fantastic and highly publicized discoveries of the last century of archaeological research:  Pyramids! Mummies! Previously unknown tombs! Heart disease in the mummy of a lesser princess! However, the texts written inside temples and tombs of Egypt during the time of the Pharaohs were highly restricted and written by and for specific audiences. Only the elites and royals would have been able to read them. Only royals and elites would have even had a large-scale rock cut tomb to provide texts. Only about 1% of ancient Egyptians were literate. What then of the other 99%, those that would have largely driven the Egyptian economy as the productive manufacturers and farmers?  This course focuses on understanding the broader scope of ancient Egypt beyond the monumental structures left behind by royals and elites to focus on the daily lives and lived experiences of the non-elite (those like you and me!) through analysis of archaeological remains of houses, non-elite burial grounds, and other records. The Pyramids, mummies, and statuary of ancient Egypt focus on what life was like among the highest elite. This course will use the archaeological site of Tell el-Amarna as the primary lens for discussions on the lives of the non-elites that would have comprised the bulk of the population.

19431,AKB-265638-19,"Ask any college student what they like to do in their spare time and most will mention either eating, drinking, or socializing. These activities, while enjoyable, actually have historical significance. Since the beginning of time, food and drink have been basic needs for every human being. However, the meaning behind these practices varied from culture to culture. For example, the ancient Greeks began their morning with barely bread dipped in wine. While this may be frowned upon in today's culture, this combination was thought to have healing powers. Also, the focus of a meal was to spend time socializing and please the palate, not to fill the stomach. In today's climate, the goal of eating changed to accommodate large portion sizes and busy schedules with less emphasis on the ancient philosophy of eating for wisdom, spirit, and nourishing the soul.   This course will take you back in time to explore ancient dietary customs and symbolism, including how materials for food and drink were gathered, processed and prepared, and their influence on health.

Course Description:With generous funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities BAVC Media is offering a Community-Based Preservation Education and Training program. Through this new program BAVC Media hopes to both address the urgency of preserving audiovisual content while digitization is still a material possibility, as well as broaden the diversity and inclusivity of the audiovisual preservation field. To accomplish this, we are working with community-based organizations to provide experiential training and education that is otherwise difficult or expensive to access graduate-level degree programs and on-the-job technical training.   The topics covered during this program will include: the setup and use of critical components of a tape-based audiovisual playback station, the maintenance and calibration of tape players and monitoring equipment, the repair and handling of tape-based media, and the identification or common video errors. These topics are meant to provide participants with hands-on experience working with audiovisual playback equipment, as well as experience performing tasks that are typically the responsibility of trained technicians. The goal is to provide individuals working with collections containing memory and heritage with the skills needed to properly preserve these materials amidst the coming magnetic media crisis.   Class instructions will all be provided remotely. These consist of asynchronous pre-recorded video resources as well synchronous office hours and group convenings, both facilitated via zoom. Office hours are scheduled for flexible chunks of time throughout the week. Group convenings will be minimal, but attendance is strongly suggested.

19840,AKB-265735-19,"The origins of medicine and philosophy are deeply connected. This is true not only in the Western traditions, but in many cultural and intellectual settings throughout the world. Moreover, not only is the historical development of philosophy and medicine inseparably interwoven, but they share a common motivation—and so also a common intellectual and emotional pattern. This motivation might best be expressed simply as ""care for well-being."" Medicine cares for the well-being of the body and philosophy cares for the well-being of thoughts, beliefs, and experience. Both traditions struggle to articulate what ""well-being"" means for human beings—body and mind—and both develop methods and procedures by which to remedy and avoid identifiable pathologies and errors. Furthermore, like the analogy that Plato's Socrates draws in Protagoras, whereby he imagines the similarities between those who care for the body—physicians—and those who care for the soul—philosophers (i.e., ""physicians of the soul"")—the one who participates in the cultivation of culture might be thought of as a ""physician of culture."" Both the body and the mind are experienced through the inherited cultural constellation of ideas, practices, and concerns that have shaped our lives from birth. To examine, compare, appreciate, and critique these inherited cultural ideas participates too in that same care for well-being. Despite having been ""thrown,"" as it were, into an always already on-going constellation of cultural traditions, each of us is also always in the position to evaluate these, select some, discard others, and create still more. This process of evaluation and creativity with regards to the question of what sort of life is most worth of our love and striving might be summed up as: the question and quest for the good life. Therefore, our aim in this course is to draw on both philosophy and medicine to enable us to understand the everyday practical and existential question about the choiceworth life.",Undergraduate,Benjamin Scott Young,,,,,"Physicians of the Soul: Medicine, Philosophy, and the Good Life",2020

Throughout its history Japan has fought to survive natural disasters, famines and disease in addition to the fighting between Samurais to unite the country's leadership. The customary practices—extending from daily habits (such as taking a bath or drinking tea) to superstitious rituals—often came from the fear of sickness, hope for a cure, and prayer. We will study the history of Japan and examine various artifacts (literature, arts, designed objects and spaces, etc.), which reflect these customary practices and beliefs from different time periods.  Modern Japan also faces serious social issues including suicide, overwork, unbalanced demographics due to low birth rates, and negative environmental effects associated with industrialization, natural disasters, and war. While these current issues are not unknown to other countries, there are some public health systems and services unique to Japan such as a Mother-Child Pocketbook. Thus, we will analyze the ""caring"" system in Japan from various perspectives including medical, health, nursing, and childcare.",Undergraduate,Atsuko Sakai,,,,,Experience Japan - from Hospitals to Hospitality (Omotenashi),2020

We invest money or divest, and we have the capacity to perpetuate harm or cultivate compassion within cityscapes.    While cities often are characterized as bustling epicenters of trade, consumption, development, and creation, they also are spaces rife with conflict and complexity.  This course examines social problems within cities, proposing that we can challenge and erode oppressive structures within them, and thereby contribute to the health of a city.   Through examination of social issues such as immigration and indigeneity, homelessness and place, imagined communities and so-called dangerous classes, we will identify patterns of (in)compassion and envision new paradigms and structures that give everyone a right to health in the city.",Undergraduate,Ulluminair Salim,,,,,The Compassionate City: A Social Autopsy,2020

That is, what are elsewheres and elsewhens of representing power and agency in southern spaces? Finally, what are ways in which we can critically theorize gender inequality, health, and resilience in risky spaces? How can we map them and map onto them? As such, the study of (gendered) violence, power, and socioeconomic and environmental conflict are central to the issues that this course seeks to examine.

In this course we will seek intellectual nourishment at the banquet of Dante's legacy by closely examining a broad range of responses to the poet—the man and his works—from Giovanni Boccaccio's biography in the late Middle Ages to Roberto Benigni's performances of TuttoDante and Dan Brown's Inferno. Between the Dante-inspired works of Boccaccio and Brown, we will study various, often conflicting, versions of ""Dante"" in literature, art, film, politics, history, and popular culture. After establishing a foundation for Dante's influence by discussing his political treatise (Monarchia) and selected cantos of his Commedia (most from Inferno), we will embark on an interpretive journey tracing Dante's evolution from a regional to a national (then nationalist) figure before he attained the global status he enjoys today. Giuseppe Mazzini famously called Dante—Ugo Foscolo's ""Ghibelline fugitive""—the ""Prophet of the Italian Nation"": we will accordingly examine appeals to Dante's authority in promoting the liberation and unification of Italy, but we will also consider his role as a beacon of liberty in the United States. Among other areas of inquiry, we will discuss Catholic interpretations of Dante as a neo-Guelph advocate of papal political power, nationalist appropriations of the poet for territorial expansion and military interventions, and recent representations of Dante as an icon of Italian culture on the world stage.",Graduate,Guy P.

Although Dante never said these exact words, they effectively convey his contempt for people who refuse to take a stand on questions of moral, political, and social justice. Engaged readers have had good reason to quote the ""Dante"" line at pivotal moments in US history, from decisions about entering the two world wars to John F. Kennedy's call to combat bigotry and Martin Luther King Jr's plea to end the war in Vietnam. Black Lives Matter activists and the California governor therefore drew on an illustrious tradition when they cited the medieval Italian poet in the summer of 2020 to inspire action against systemic racism.   Political engagement with Dante in the United States actually dates to the mid 19th century—in the movement to abolish slavery and during the ensuing Civil War—and is just one of several major themes we will explore in this course on the Italian poet's strong presence in American history and culture.

We begin by asking what do we mean by health—is health something fixed across time and cultures or is it variable? Is health a property of an individual or something better thought of in terms of a community? Health is something we desire and understood as a ""good,"" but also sometimes imposed upon us as a moral imperative. Health may stand in for other socially desirable qualities: beauty, youth, racialized and gendered ideals. How do we measure and track health or wellness—for ourselves, for others, for our communities? How has health, well-being, illness, disease been understood and experienced in different places and different times? Topics to be explored include cross-historical and cross-cultural concepts of contagion, disease, illness, medicine, care, and healing; public health and health disparities; uses and misuses of data; health history and why history matters for thinking about and seeking health. This course is co-taught by multiple faculty and local experts and open to all students, though particularly addressed to students in their first 4 contracts.

This ISP fulfills the ""Professionalization Seminar"" requirement for the HCS-Joint AOC.   This ISP will include meeting with a range of health and health-adjacent professionals (including NCF alums!) to learn about their work, their preparation and education. We'll be exploring together here!  Participants will be expected to attend regular meetings (some in person, some on zoom) with professionals and alumni/ae who will share their career experiences. Plan on meeting 3X in the first two or three weeks for up to 1.5 hours each, and then working independently to prepare your final project.   Some off-campus experiences may be included, schedules permitting. Some readings and website reviews will be required. A regular reflection journal is expected.  •Final project: choose a particular health-related career path, research it, and present to the group in the final week. We'll share information about how to discover interesting career options, where to research them (including informational interviews), and a format for presentations.     Projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) show that healthcare jobs are expected to increase by 18% from 2016 through 2026.  Open to students at all levels.

21594,AC-277755-21,"This interdisciplinary honors seminar focuses on what we call ""Miami Studies,"" a field of inquiry and urban studies that centers Miami and its many surrounding communities, cultures, and histories. Miami is one of the most important cities in the United States and the Americas. Yet its history, culture, politics, and overall meaning are still largely caricatured through myth, stigma, and hyperbole, all of which are deeply rooted in the region's layered past and relationship to colonial processes and empire. Although the region and the millions of people who reside in and traverse it every year remain woefully understudied and misunderstood, community and grassroots efforts have long created, fostered, and studied local knowledges that serve as a corrective to this broader national narrative that has marginalized and underscored Miami as a site of significant cultural and intellectual inquiry and impact.   This course will ask you to dig deeper into Miami's past by not only unpacking its difficult and untold histories, but also by inviting you to learn through immersive experiences, particularly through visits to museums, historic sites, archives, and cultural institutions. Visits tentatively include the Historic Hampton House, the Black Archives, HistoryMiami Museum, and the Museum of Graffiti.

How are these ideas enforced, and how have they changed over time? What social and cultural influences affect our understanding and embodiment of gender, specifically with respect to race, sexuality, and socio-economic status? And what even is gender; what does it mean to say, as many do today, that gender is performative? By analyzing gender, how might we come to understand it in the context of social justice rather than as biological fact? Might we embrace theory and literary interpretation as the praxis of enacting gender in ways that restore justice and repair harm for so many (perhaps, for all) who have suffered under gender's ideological-political regime?   This course will incorporate some canonical gender theory texts while simultaneously including literature that handles matters of gender as matters of life and love, enabling us to approach the theoretical questions as more embodied and thus relevant. By examining some of the theories contributing to the gender debates in the west, students will gain a new frame through which to interpret a variety of literature and develop a deeper understanding of gender identity, especially attending to how it is influenced by distinctions of race, class, desire, and ethnicity.

The thematic topics to be discussed include law and social control; law's role in social change; as well as law's capacity to reach into complex social relations and intervene in existing normative institutions, organizational structures, and the like. Goals and Learning Objectives   Upon completion of the course, students will have developed the following: 1. the ability to examine social structures analytically and critically; 2. knowledge of how people change society by forming social movements and using the media; 3. a comparative perspective on cultures, social structures, institutions, and practices; and 4. the ability to read and understand original research published by sociologists.",Undergraduate,Jill Weinberg,,,,,Sociology of Law - syllabus modification for TUPIT,2021

We will take a rather sweeping ""general view"" of the literature written during these one hundred and fifty plus years by paying particular attention to aesthetic experiment and innovation within the context of persistent themes and broad cultural trends. Considering some of the highlights of the English tradition, including those which challenge or revise the very notions of Englishness and tradition, we will trace evolving ideas about the function of the artist in society, practice reading poetry out loud to learn about meter and prosody, and look at some of the ways the literature of this period can help us to think about the ways we use language today.   More specifically, through an investigation of the shifting relationship between the British Literature of the past 150+ years and the sociopolitical contexts in which it was produced, we will learn how to develop historically informed methods of approaching literary texts.  At the same time, we will be attentive to the various ways writers of this period use language as an art form in order to think about how different writing styles change how an idea is understood.  Finally, by writing close analytical commentaries on the texts we read, we will cultivate an understanding of our own relationship to and use of the English language.  In sum, as we explore the flexibility of English to represent and reflect on a wide range of cultural and historical conditions, we will be constantly considering the role that the creative uses of language can play in navigating the complexities of the  world.",Undergraduate,John Lurz,,,,,British Literature Survey,2021

Why are these stories (particularly fictional ones) so important, even necessary, an element in what it means to be human?  That question is at the center of this course.  And if those stories are everywhere and in every culture, does that mean the stories are the same and work in the same way?  Do they perform different functions in those different cultures and at different times in history?  In this course we will attempt to understand those questions by reading, discussing, and writing about a selection of short fiction, beginning in the 19th century and moving to the present day. We will explore how the tradition of short fiction differs from that of the novel but also from non-fiction writing.

In this course, we will explore these questions though a sociological lens. We begin by examining the processes that create racial and ethnic difference – histories of racial formation through settler colonialism and empire; practices of prejudice, discrimination, and racial domination; and dynamics that contribute to the ongoing social construction of racial and ethnic boundaries and meanings. Students will look to how social movements have challenged the status quo in pursuit of racial justice. Though this course focuses on race and ethnicity in the United States, we will periodically examine how race operates in other national contexts and as a global phenomenon.

21822,AA-277557-21,"Understandings of Jesus have been staggeringly diverse: esoteric gnostic savior, teacher of ethics, Stoic sage, resurrected deity who defeated death, Son of God, Jewish Messiah spurned by Jews, irreverent divine man- child, willowy effeminate sufferer, hypermasculine vindicator, vanguard of the Crusaders, apocalyptic avenger, liberator of slaves, and queer icon. Sometimes these understandings of Jesus have been explicitly contradictory: defender of capitalism &amp; neoliberalism vs protector of the marginalized and forgotten. One could argue that Jesus is among the most widely (re)imagined, pliable, and repurposed figures in recorded history. This course will examine the numerous ways in which people in the ancient Mediterranean and people in the modern West have imagined and shaped Jesus in theology, visual art, and modern film. The class will begin in antiquity, as we examine the earliest depictions of Jesus, in texts and in visual art. We will read numerous ancient gospels, many of them noncanonical. The course will then consider depictions of Jesus in the writings of early Church Fathers and later portrayals of Jesus in the Middle Ages. The second half of the course will look at Jesus from the 19th to 21st centuries. We will explore Jesus as the defender of slave holders and as liberator of slaves, Jesus as feminist and Jesus as patriarch, Jesus as bastion of conservative politics and Jesus as radical revolutionary. The goal of the class is to develop an understanding of the myriad ways in which Jesus has been crafted, described, portrayed, and utilized over the centuries. This understanding necessitates an awareness for the cultural and historical context for such portrayals. Such an interest also entails an awareness of the political and social interests of those who represent Jesus in any particular manner. The course aims to help students develop critical approaches to historical figures and religious entities and to better understand how heroes, saviors, and de",Undergraduate,Jennifer Eyl,,,,,From Jesus to Yeezus,2022
21823,AA-277557-21,"Civic Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on critical reflection, ethical thinking, and action for social change. People who think and act together to improve society must address problems of collective action (how to get members to work together) and deliberation (how to reason together about contested values). They must understand how power is organized and how it operates within and between societies. They must grapple with social conflict, violence, and other obstacles to peaceful cooperation. When tensions arise within a group, people face questions of justice and fairness, and they must confront questions about appropriate relationships to outsiders of all types. This introductory course explores ethical, political, and theological frameworks for understanding how people can and should organize themselves to improve societies. Readings are drawn from philosophy and political theory, political science, economics, the history of social movements, and other disciplines. This course provides theoretical grounding for Civic Studies majors and for other students interested in social change.",Undergraduate,Erin Kelly,,,,,Introduction to Civic Studies,2022

Through interdisciplinary perspectives, this course will examine amend-making processes with a primary focus on ""the apology"". We will investigate why people choose to offer or withhold an apology and the factors that complicate these decisions. Together, we will analyze contemporary apologies and non-apologies. Research from several fields including psychology, sociology, philosophy and legal studies have shown us that an apology can be used both as an instrument to repair harm and as a tool to minimize consequences. The latter part of the course will focus on the apology as a process of rebalancing and restoring justice including an examination of political and legal apologies.   Course Objectives:  •Explore and critically analyze major theoretical approaches to understanding harm, forgiveness, and making amends •Understand the social, cultural and historical forces that shape the apology process  •Integrate perspectives from multiple fields to create your own framework for evaluating an apology  •Identify the historical and cultural connections between political apologies and ideologies of justice, truth and power •Enjoy the learning process through discussion and collaboration with your classmates",Undergraduate,Quinn Phillips,,,,,Thinking About Justice 1: Examining the Apology,2022

21826,AA-277557-21,"Literatures of Justice (LoJ) is an upper-level 3-credit course that encourages students to engage with the idea of justice and the practices that borrow its name as we learn about the US criminal legal system through a multidisciplinary lens that includes historical analysis, sociology, literature, and personal narrative – those published and those shared by class members. This course examines the carceral system through the eyes of scholars and critics, many of whom are people with lived experience of incarceration. Any study of the prison system must center histories of racism and racial segregation, as well as the many voices that challenge the status quo in U.S. ""criminal justice."" By studying the use of incarceration specifically in the United States and by incorporating experts on incarceration as students in this course, LoJ aims to break down the carceral logics that have led to the imprisonment of over 2 million people currently in our nation, the country with the highest rate of incarceration and highest number of incarcerated people in the world. The historically recent rise of prisons in the U.S. is examined in this course in light of 1.) its central relationship to America's founding ideals emerging from European Enlightenment thought as well as 2.) the institutions of U.S. slavery, racial segregation, economic inequity, and white supremacy. Simultaneously in this class that utilizes an intersectional approach, we will ask how the carceral system polices norms related to gender and sexuality and whether current definitions of gender itself rely on a carceral logic. As part of a wider abolitionist educational and activist project, this course will, perhaps most significantly, enable students to explore and enact new ways of relating to one another and thus new ways of understanding and repairing harm.",Undergraduate,Hilary Binda,,,,,Literatures of Justice,2021

This project focused on cataloging a group of objects with a high standard ofaccuracy, acquiring information through visual and scientific analysis, research, and expert consultation. Where visual identification was inconclusive, peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) provided a species identification, to varying degrees of certainty, based upon existing reference tables. The grant allowed the museum to invest in the equipment required to prepare samples for PMF, while MALDI-ToF analysis is conducted at the University of Delaware's Mass Spectrometry Facility. While working on PMF analysis with infrequent or one-off users of the technique (art conservation students, material culture students, museum cataloguers), Winterthur scientists started looking into more user-friendly ways to cross-reference MALDI-ToF data of collagen markers to known, open-source collagen marker reference lists.

Wild Kingdom Helper then finds collagen and keratin markers from the list and determines whether the sample is deamidated or not. The input data is compared to all m/z values in a table of species.

A list of possible species (listed from best to worst match) is then outputted, alongside the certainty factor: percentage of total markers found.

22346,AKB-279460-21,"Welcome to Mensch – Maschine: Eine Einführung in die deutschsprachige Literatur! The nineteenth century marks a time of rapid social, political, and economic change in the German speaking lands. In the latter half of the century, the German states unified into one nation and Germany quickly transitioned from an agrarian to an industrial nation. Berlin became one of the most modern metropolises at the onset of the twentieth century with its massive population growth and expansion of industry and infrastructure. German historian Jürgen Osterhammel speaks of a ""transformation of the world"" during the nineteenth century, with reference to historical paradigms such as the industrial revolution and the relationship between man, nature, and technology. Groundbreaking technological inventions such as the railway and the steam engine and the increasing ""technologization"" of human life changed more traditional ways of living; technology also became a subject matter of scrutiny in contemporary cultural production like art and literature. German literature abounds with references to the new technological age and the relationship between human beings and technology. This demonstrates the abiding relevance of literature for its potential to reflect ""real life"" and at the same time critically examine humanity and the ethics of human action in the world. This course will offer you an overview of major works and literary periods in German language literature, from the late nineteenth century until the present.

It will take an historical approach to artists' paints and painting techniques, paying particular attention to moments of intense experimentation with new formulations and transformed studio practices at specific historical junctures. How do specific artists mobilize paints, canvas, varnish, and other materials to communicate with viewers? We will explore who the artist imagines he or she is primarily engaging with and to what end, and how audiences and their manner of engagement with paintings is shaped in specific historical and cultural circumstances. Students will have hands-on experience with different kinds of paints—including tempera, oil, watercolors, and acrylics—to gain some insight into how they behave, along with techniques of application specific to particular paints and artists. No artistic expertise is necessary nor expected! During the first semester of the course, students will participate in the close analysis of several paintings from differing historical periods. We will use a range of analytic techniques and historical records to glean information concerning the pigments used, how they were applied, and whether or not the paintings are what they claim to be. The second semester of this two-course sequence will entail a guided research process whereby students will each conduct an in-depth analysis of a painting of any time period in the collection of the Binghamton University Art Museum and will together conceptualize and develop an exhibition focusing on these works that will open in the museum in the last week of the Spring semester.

However, in what some scholars have termed a ""second discovery of the sea,"" the nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed a vast expansion of scientific and humanistic knowledge of the sea and—in sometimes overlapping spheres—a host of corresponding ""new media."" Drawing on a growing academic ""Blue Humanities"" subfield that critically examines the ocean and this history, this seminar will consider how the ocean—and more broadly, the aquatic—has been visualized, narrated, theorized, occupied, colonized, and mediated throughout modernity. This seminar is taught in an Art History department, and in turn, framed within the broader context of the Tyler School of Art and Architecture. Therefore, the class will focus on the aesthetic dimensions of the ocean and its various ""media ecologies"" (McLuhan, Postman) as encountered through photography, film, visual art, sound, architecture, performance, print, etc. Accordingly, our interdisciplinary approach will privilege a wide-ranging investigation of the aquatic and its associated contexts. In addition to the usual suspects in art history and art practice, our readings will draw from media studies (in particular, a strain of German media theory advanced by Friedrich Kittler, Bernhard Siegert, and others); histories of science and technology; anthropology; (eco)critical theory; indigenous knowledge; postcolonial studies, science fiction; and recent theories of the Anthropocene. Particular interest will be paid to how—like other abstract and uninhabitable spaces (outer space, the desert, the arctic poles)—the ocean has served as a site for experimental mediation and radical aesthetic possibility throughout late modernity, even as cataclysmic climate change threatens to transform the oceans and their supported systems.",Graduate,James Merle Thomas,,,,,"Wild Blue Medium: Modernity, Media, and the Writing of the Ocean",2021

23604,GI-271448-20,"Our special topics seminar this semester will focus on Roman Landscapes. Roman art provides some of our earliest examples of the depiction of landscape. Although there are important precursors in Greek, Near Eastern, and Egyptian art, the earliest examples in the European tradition of what we would recognize as landscape painting emerge in Ancient Rome in the first century B.C.E. In these paintings, the landscape itself attracts the viewer's attention as much as the figures or buildings set in it.   Landscape art emerges in Rome during a fraught historical period, one in which dramatic and rapid urbanization caused the population of the city to swell to over a million inhabitants. The increasing tendency to depict peaceful natural settings in Roman art comes exactly at the same moment when the Roman countryside was being roiled by almost a century of civil war.   In our course this semester, we will try to understand when and why this focus on landscape art emerged at Rome. We will first focus on the historical background of landscape art, including the history of land use on the Italian peninsula and the particular Roman emphasis on the countryside. We will then read some of the major works of poetry from the late republic and early Augustan period that engage with issues around land and environment, including Virgil's Eclogues and Georgics. Finally, we will turn to visual landscapes, particularly the proliferation of landscape frescoes that decorated Roman houses and the similar phenomenon of carefully arranged gardens and other natural spaces that were an integral feature of Roman home design.  This course is being offered at the same time as a major exhibit at the San Antonio Museum of Art entitled ""Roman Landscapes: Visions of Nature and Myth from Rome and Pompeii."" Students will pay several visits to this exhibit. Thanks to the generosity of the Lennox Foundation, four distinguished scholars will also visit to give a public lecture and teach the class.",Undergraduate,Timothy M.

23651,BH-250789-16,"Modernization has played an important role in the evolution of man and big dams have been a symbol of modernity in developing as well as developed countries. On the one hand, they represent clean energy and economic development for the society they have also been critiqued for being the center of many political, indigenous, cultural and social conflicts. These conflicts emerge from competing interests, perception of benefits and strategies. Across the globe there are striking similarities and remarkable disparities between various dam projects. This course will focus particularly on the competing narratives of modernization and transformation within the context of a historical, policy and cultural studies approach that will help us understand the symbolic and material role the dams play in our lives as well as the interactions of dam proponents and counter proponents especially the indigenous societies across the globe whose human rights and social justice issues are at stake in these conflicts. The course explores the practices and politics of large-scale dam projects and the conflicting values, visons and relations of power that are related to them. Particularly, the course focuses on the discourses of modernity and its impact on indigenous cultures, environmental and social justice issues and water right of the tribes in the United States with special reference to the Grand Coulee Dam and across many developing societies.",Undergraduate,"Vandana Asthana, Dorothy Zeisler-Vralsted",,,,,MODERNIZATION AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES—COMPETING NARRATIVES OF DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL JUSTICE,2020

24320,AC-284519-22,"This course addresses the role of values in technology: Who is technology for? What could it be? How does it relate to its social and historical contexts? You will be asked to think systematically and imaginatively about technology's dis/dysaffordances, that is how the design of different technologies assists and constrains everyday life. The course asks whether there is a ""right"" way to do technology, and if there is, how we might go about pursuing it. To explore this question, the course draws on cross-disciplinary materials taken from literature, history, sociology, anthropology, politics, and philosophy, and introduces students to the principles of design justice and inclusive design.",Undergraduate,"Zac Zimmer, Ben Breen, Mark Howard, Caitlin Flaws",,,,,Ethics and Tech,2022
24321,AC-284519-22,"This is a course about the technologies people build to record and transmit language. We look at contemporary technologies like social media, automatic speech recognition and translation tools, and formats like Unicode. But we also look at other important technical developments — writing, the printing press, and mass communication — as well as ways that different societies and cultures have reacted to the issues these technologies have introduced, including questions of access and accessibility, ownership and privacy, the economics of these technologies, and how information and mis-information spreads. Students will explore the ways that culture and language interact, how cultural circumstances can shape linguistic understanding and interpretation, and how these technologies can in turn shape cultural practices.",Undergraduate,"Pranav Anand, Kirsten Silva Gruesz, Allison Ngyuen",,,,,Language Technology: Themes Across Cultures and Histories,2022
24325,AC-284519-22,"In this course, students will learn how humans and machines have interacted, become intertwined, and opposed one another throughout history, from the paleolithic era to the present. By examining a variety of texts (theory, philosophy, theater, visual art, instruction manuals, films, advertisements, podcasts), students explore how machines can enable, inhibit, and control their users in a variety of contexts. Students will also apply historically grounded knowledge to propose technological solutions to contemporary problems.",Undergraduate,"Martin Devecka, Matt O'Hara, Dustin Gray, Marilia Kaisar",,,,,Humans and Machines,2022
24326,AC-284519-22,"Despite the ways we are led to think about technologies as neutral and bias-free, this course asks you to consider how racial and gendered logics shape, and are shaped by, technological innovations (such as facial recognition, codes and algorithms, data networks, surveillance technologies, and drones). By turning to films, news articles, websites, and scholarly articles, we look beyond the marketing and promise of technologies to assess how inequalities are programmed into the automated code driving techno-intelligence. With the goal of social justice and a more ethical approach to technological design, we ask: Who benefits and who loses through these ""innovations""? We will also assess the holistic picture of technological development, including what historical context inspires the development of a technology, how they affect the environment, who works to build the components, and who becomes the experts of how we address social problems. You will have the opportunity to work together to debate these issues and to consider how we might propose alternative solutions or interact differently with technologies and the worlds they offer.",Undergraduate,"Felicity Schaeffer, Amanda Smith, Debbie Duarte, Mia Boykin",,,,,Race and Technology,2022
24327,AC-284519-22,"This course explores the technologies that variously delight, extend, and command our imagination. Although we will think through the many potentials these technologies of representation open, we will also explore the social and political problems they can create or amplify. We will also collaborate on creative responses to those problems. In this iteration of the course, our focus is on technologies for visual representation. We will examine cameras, drones, apps, algorithms and other technologies that allow people to make and share images. We will ask how these technologies shape how and what we see, as well as what they keep hidden and obscure. And we will ask how power operates in the making, circulation, and consumption of pre- and post-internet visual culture.",Undergraduate,"Kyle Parry, Kate Jones, LuLing Osofsky",,,,,Technologies of Representation,2022
