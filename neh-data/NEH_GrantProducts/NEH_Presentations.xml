		<Abstract>Susan Sessions Rugh, author of "Are We There Yet?: The Golden Age of American Family Vacations," will speak about the rise of family travel in post-World War II America. Rugh examines how postwar prosperity and mass consumption-aided by paid vacation, car ownership, and the new interstate highway system-initiated the ritual of the family road trip. This lecture is being held in conjunction with our traveling exhibit, "Our Lives, Our Stories: America's Greatest Generation."&amp;#x0D; (The NEH on the Road traveling exhibition)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Tea Talk at the ASCSA examines Pausanias' arrangement and expression of his material and evaluates his authorial choices in light of the contemporary literary currents of the day and the cultural milieu of the Roman Empire in the time of Hadrian and the Antonines. The descriptions offered in the Periegesis Hellados are also examined in the context of the archaeo- logical evidence available for the places Pausanias visited. This study reveals Pausanias to be a surprisingly sophisticated literary craftsman and a unique witness to Greek identity at a time when that identity was never more conflicted.</Abstract>

His presentation will be followed by a free reception and gallery viewing of "Wild Land: Thomas Cole and the Birth of the American Landscape Painting," a nationally touring exhibition premiering at the Museum. This beautiful exhibition takes visitors "into the woods" and through Cole's studio, revealing the ways in which he and other artists of his time pioneered cultural conversations that shaped our national landscape intellectually, physically, and visually.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the National Folklore Festival held in Cosquín, Argentina, the relationship of tradition, modernity, and identity so present in Latin America is manifested through music:  a conflict exists regarding what "musical folklore" is and thus which genres, styles, and musical instruments to permit.  Some involved think that "authentic" folklore is only the most traditional type, but others believe it includes modernized folk/popular music.  By means of this aesthetic controversy, Argentine identity is negotiated.  Cosquín Festival organizers want to preserve "authentic" national culture yet at the same time permit originality of creation in folk/popular music and dance amidst globalization and the arrival of other musics, ideologies, and technologies.  The Pre-Cosquín Competition for new talent, held the two weeks prior to the Festival proper each year, carries out this objective:  2500 semifinalists from over 50 regional centers compete to earn the right to perform at the Festival and be named the Festival's "Revelation."  In this paper, I explain what is being done to negotiate the confrontation of musical values in the Pre-Cosquín Competition process.  Data are based on fieldwork done with Festival organizers, Pre-Cosquín jury members (criteria used), participants, and the experience of having served as a Pre-Cosquín Festival inspector. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Wat passe?". What has happened to Italian language and identity in the European scenario of Diego Marani's fiction? "Aqui in Venezia sumus, keine Paris!"… Really? An Italian newspaper columnist, novelist and translator for the Council of the European Union, Diego Marani invented an artificial language called Europanto in which he has been writing articles and short stories since 1996. More than a mock international language with a provocative aim, Europanto offers the model for a non-hierarchical European subjectivity that erodes national linguistic barriers and also the all-encompassing power of English as Europe's alleged lingua franca.&amp;#x0D; "Eh? Wat signifique?" "No! No esse so facile!"&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The advent of digital technologies opens unprecedented scenarios for a transformative transmission and dissemination of Italian culture. At a time when the survival of the humanist ‘tradition' is in question, ‘virtual heritage' aims to preserve the material past in a new dimension. Yet, a sustainable cultural past, a living cultural memory, depends on a continuous process of translation and adaptation - linguistic, cognitive and technological. Digital libraries, open archives, the whole architecture of the semantic web configure novel possibilities of accessing, and reinventing, the (Italian) humanist tradition. Presentation of the VHL as a platform for a creative transmission of Italian cultural artifacts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Current interest in endangered languages provides an opportunity to reflect on the ways in which linguistics tackles the study of language. These are more varied than outsiders tend to assume and leave linguists uncertain about how they fit into C.P. Snow's "two cultures" schema of science and the humanities. Professor Field will provide examples from his work on the history and current status of Gascon.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Much of modern philosophy has been concerned with resolving the apparent tension between two seeming platitudes: (i) the ‘Objectivity Assumption': the external world exists independently of us, and (ii) the ‘Cognitive Access Assumption': we are able to acquire knowledge about the external world. This talk describes some of the theories that have been developed to address this dilemma, and argues that a successful resolution requires us to accept the existence of the synthetic a priori. An epistemology based on the principle of inference to the best explanation allows us to do that.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the 21st century, how best to relate the history of the National Park Service's Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, the most popular historical attraction in the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area and a major archaeological site, with more than 1 million visitors per year and 2 million artifacts to show?  With digital stories told via mobile devices.  This talk, given by Dr. Dene Grigar, focuses on the "Fort Vancouver Mobile," an NEH-funded project that brings together a team of 18 experts and scholars from throughout the digital humanities field -- including historians, archaeologists and academics specializing in digital media production as well as literature, rhetoric and writing -- to tell the story of the fascinating and multicultural history of the place once dubbed the "New York of the Pacific."  Specifically, she will discuss the way design and non-fiction historical writing come together when mobile devices are used for digital storytelling.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Much of the modern philosophy of causation has been governed by two ideas: (i) causes make effects inevitable; (ii) a cause is something that makes a difference to whether its effect occurs. I focus on explaining the origin of idea (ii) and its connection to (i). On my view, the frequent attempts to turn (ii) into an analysis of causation are wrongheaded. Patterns of difference-making aren't what makes causal claims true. They merely provide a useful test for causal claims. Moreover, what justifies us in using them as a test is idea (i). That's how (i) and (ii) are connected.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Some philosophers, the 'anti-individualists,' believe that all fundamental facts are purely qualitative. They could in principle be stated without mentioning any specific individual by name. Other philosophers, the 'individualists,' believe that the fundamental facts also include facts about which individuals exist and how the qualitative properties and relations are distributed over them. Anti-individualists are committed to the idea that all facts supervene on the qualitative facts. I argue that that thesis yields implausible consequences in the theory of chance and counterfactuals. Ultimately, individualism carries the day.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I am interested particularly in the proliferation of autobiography during the first half of the nineteenth century, the historical and cultural circumstances that permitted and encouraged that proliferation, and—as a consequence—the ways in which Victorian England tended inexorably to define the subject as a textual thing rooted in dynamics of profit and exchange. The argument comes from Chapter 1 of my book in progress, which argues that the growing tendency to textualize and commodify the subject created anxieties that found expression not only in contemporary criticism but also in the mid-century novel, particularly in the sensation novels of the 1860s. I will talk about the period's autobiographical proliferation, then turn my attention to both the legal culture that helped to produce it and to its implications for our understanding of the relation between Victorian subjectivity, the literary market, and other forms of Victorian prose.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 2011 Wewoka Sorghum Festival was a celebration of the different cultures that have comprised the Seminole County region since the mid-Nineteenth Century. The theme for this year's festival was "Sorghum: The Key Ingredient", in recognition of the Wewoka community hosting the first leg of the "Key Ingredients: America by Food" tour. Much of the festival highlighted the Anglo, Freedmen and Seminole cultures as expressed through their traditional and contemporary foods. Key goals of the festival were to: 1. Promote the history and culture of our community; 2. Create an appreciation of diverse cultures by sharing their similarities and celebrating their uniqueness; 3. Provide accessible programming to underserved individuals; and 4. Create a positive economic impact on the Wewoka community and Seminole Nation Museum. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The major draw to the festival - even more so than the production of the sorghum - is the ability to watch the creation of artworks and artifacts by many of our traditional Native artists. All day long, crowds line-up throughout our grounds to enjoy making colorful Seminole patchwork, watch the tanning of hides, making of arrow points, baskets, beadwork and other expressions of material culture. The tribal elders spent many hours engaging the public with the significance of these crafts and how they are integral to the history and survival of their peoples. They also relate how many of these traditions have evolved throughout time and what their place is in contemporary society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the Chickasaw language, lowak sho'li means to "carry the fire" next to one's heart. This fire, the humanities, is essential, vital, life sustaining and—we are convinced—restorative. The Chickasaw Nation Division of Arts and Humanities ardently seeks to ignite a passion for the humanities in the hearts of others. On October 6, 2011, the Chickasaw Nation Division of Arts and Humanities hosted its inaugural Lowak Sho'li "Carry the Fire" Native Humanities Forum in the Black Box Theatre of its new facility at 201 North Broadway in Ada. With the support and generous assistance of the Oklahoma Humanities council, this event created important public dialogue among tribal members, students and the general public for greater understanding of cultural and historic diversity in Oklahoma, the role of the humanities in education and other sectors, and the benefits of the humanities to not only individuals but also communities.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Elliott West, Professor of History at the University of Arkansas, spoke on the topic: The West Before Lewis and Clark: Three Lives. His summary of the lecture:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Too often we think that western history began with the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804-1806, but there was a lot that happened before that famous journey. Trace the stories of three persons—a young Frenchman, an Indian woman and a Spanish woman captured by Comanches--to illustrate how sweeping changes were transforming the West, and in particular the Great Plains, including what is now Oklahoma, for a century and a quarter before Lewis and Clark set off up the Missouri River. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; After his lecture, Professor West answered questions from the audience about Lewis and Clark and the historical characters he focused on, the Frenchman, the Indian woman, the Spanish woman, and the Comanche tribe. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The goal of the project was to share Professor West's expertise of Great Plains and Western history and his storytelling skills with a local public audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The historical study of women's lives often requires the piecing together of disparate and partial evidence mined from archives. Happily, archives are now being put online, which both removes barriers to access and offers powerful new approaches to searching and visualizing content. This presentation will introduce the audience to the project of publishing online the correspondence of 17th-century Italian-French noblewoman Marie Mancini, with a dual focus on the content of the letters and on the creation of the website for their publication.   Marie Mancini (1639-1715) was famous as the first love of Louis XIV of France, and later she and her sister Hortense became scandalous celebrities by running away from their husbands and traveling unaccompanied through much of Western Europe. Though she steadfastly refused to return to her husband in Rome, Marie carried on a regular correspondence with him, and her letters are held in the Colonna family archive, which resides in the library of the Benedictine monastery of Santa Scolastica in Subiaco, Italy. Her husband Lorenzo Colonna's letters to her have been lost due to the circumstances of her itinerant life, and so what we have is a one-sided conversation through which to attempt a reconstruction of the chess match between Marie and Lorenzo, and its intersection with the broader concerns of international diplomacy.  Project leader Sarah Nelson and assistant Alessandro Martina will discuss the discoveries and remaining mysteries in the letters they have so far transcribed and translated. Library faculty member Olivia Wikle and research assistant Liam Marchant will discuss the choices and challenges involved in the creation of the project website, with a demonstration of the tools that allow varying chronological and spatial visualizations of the material.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Shipwrecks, smuggling, and… Islam? What if we retold the story of the spice trade—oft appreciated as a catalyst for Europe's "Age of Discovery"—through the eyes of the late medieval Muslim merchants and scholars who mixed Islam and business across the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean? And what might the maritime corridor that linked the world of the 13th-16th centuries have to teach us about the "moral economy" in Islamic thought, and the complex relationship between religion and the birth of global capitalism more broadly? Offering a preview of his second book project, Joel Blecher will take up these questions by examining a few episodes from this understudied chapter in the history of Islam and explain why it can help us better understand our world today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The library's purpose of this assessment is to develop a long-term preservation plan "to delineate our conservation needs by developing the proper strategies and actions to meet those needs. In so doing, we will be establishing a much-needed initial framework. This long-term plan will serve as a basic working tool during the coming years. In addition, the plan will justify to the University and funding agencies and foundations our preservation needs. It will also establish a future comprehensive plan for our invaluable collection pieces, many which are not found elsewhere. This activity, beyond attending to our particular needs, will also serve as a working model to other libraries in our Campus."  (José E. Flores Ramos, 2018). This preservation plan is based on this written assessment report that will include recommendations for proper storage, housing and more important issues to be considered.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Sanctuary of the Great Gods on the island of Samothrace is one of the most important sanctuaries of the ancient Greek world, used as a sacred space from the 7th century BCE into the Roman Empire. Famous for its initiation rituals, the site presents one of the richest architectural landscapes of the Aegean, famous not only for its Archaic development, but also for its continued development into the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In this lecture, Dr. Bonna Wescoat, director of excavations at Samothrace, will discuss new insights on how that sacred space was used and how visitors experienced the sanctuary.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An exploration of the content and significance of three recent theatrical productions from the Arabian Peninsula: Habiba Al-Abdullah's "A Bite," which takes a short story by Anton Chekhov as its inspiration and applies it to the problem of "wasta" (nepotism/cronyism) in Kuwait; Talal Mahmoud's "Four o'clock," which illustrates the challenges faced by Gulf citizens who suffer from various forms of obsessive-compulsive disorder; and "Salvation," by Abd al-Khaliq Sayf al-Jabri, which comments pointedly on the roles played by Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the current violent conflict in Yemen.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Le monument de la Victoire de Samothrace est un emblème de la sculpture hellénistique. En 2014, sa restauration au musée du Louvre a permis de mieux comprendre les techniques ingénieuses mises en œuvre pour sa réalisation.  En effet, le bateau qui constitue la base du monument a été entièrement démonté, tout comme certaines parties rapportées de la statue. Avant restauration, l'ensemble du monument a fait l'objet d'une campagne d'examens et d'analyses en partenariat avec le Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musées de France et Paris Sorbonne-Pierre et Marie Curie. Les résultats ont été confirmé ou précisé les hypothèses antérieures au sujet des matériaux utilisés. Un réexamen des fragments de la statue et du bateau conservés en réserve a fourni l'opportunité de retrouver l'emplacement de certaines parties du monument et de les réintégrer.  Parallèlement la mission américaine de Samothrace a conduit une série d'investigations dans le secteur où s'élevait le monument à l'Antiquité afin de comprendre comment il était présenté. Ces recherches avaient pour objet de réviser les anciennes reconstitutions du monument in situ et de proposer des hypothèses fondées sur une étude précise du terrain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 1994 ARCE has maintained an archive of 78 conservation and documentation projects funded by USAID. The archive comprises important collections of images, reports, and drawings documenting the conservation process for Egyptian cultural heritage sites spanning virtually all of the country's historical and cultural eras. Until 2016, original data and the majority of ARCE archival holdings remained inaccessible to anyone unable to visit ARCE's office in Cairo.  In 2016, ARCE and the UCLA Library partnered to launch two ARCE archival collections on UCLA's Digital Library platform, the International Digital Ephemera Project (IDEP). The successful processing and publication of ARCE's first archival digital collection, in parallel with the knowledge acquired by ARCE staff through this partnership, inspired the organization to seek further funding opportunities to continue digitization and publication of the invaluable Conservation Archives.  In 2019, ARCE won an award from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to lay the foundations for digitizing and publishing more collections, including a processing manual and foundational archival policies. The Archives team digitized and published three additional collections on ARCE's newly published Conservation Archives website, developed in partnership with the UCLA Digital Library. ARCE's digital collections fulfil an important obligation of scholarship by disseminating the research, and project documentation, thereby expanding public access to richly diverse material in fields such as Egyptology, anthropology, history, religious studies, etc. This paper, presented by Andreas Kostopoulos, ARCE's project archives specialist includes an overview of the past five years' digital efforts and challenges, as well as data for the projects currently available on ARCE Conservation Archives website.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How has Japonisme shaped the reception of Japanese art? In this online program, professors Elizabeth Emery and Chelsea Foxwell will consider the persistent influence of the western construct of Japonisme and the new aesthetic forms it inspired.  In 1872, French art critic Philippe Burty coined the term "Japonisme" to refer to the growing western admiration for "all things Japanese." European and American enthusiasm for Japanese exports led, however, to the creation of entirely new categories of Japanese "art" than those recognized in Japan. Elizabeth Emery, author of Reframing Japonisme: Women and the Asian Art Market in Nineteenth-Century France, 1853–1914 (Bloomsbury, 2020), will reassess the conceptual framework of Japonisme to ask: who has the right to create new aesthetic categories? Who and what do such classifications exclude? How have temporally specific cultural preferences shaped entire fields of study?  Professor Emery's presentation will be followed by a response from Chelsea Foxwell, a specialist in modern Japanese-style (Nihonga) painting, and a moderated conversation with curator Rachel Saunders.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For many years western Anatolia was one of the least known cultural landscapes in the second–millennium BCE eastern Mediterranean, overshadowed by its better-known neighbors in Hittite central Anatolian and Minoan and Mycenaean cultural spheres. Owing to the efforts of recent decades, it is becoming possible to grasp the character of western Anatolian identity, or rather identities, as well as their place(s) in the Bronze Age world. The citadel site of Kaymakci with its broad exposure and relatively short term of use has brought new understanding of the culture and role of the region in the Bronze Age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The historical poetry reading titled "The Humanizing Force of Black Poetry in the Antebellum South" was assembled to analyze and provide context to poetry published by black-owned newspapers in the antebellum era. Three Holmes humanities instructors were assembled for a discussion panel, with a fourth Holmes humanities instructor serving as moderator. Each panelist was charged to explore a different facet of the three poems selected for the event. After each poem was read by a Holmes student volunteer, the context of literature, historical connection, and prosody of each selected poem were presented and discussed, allowing 15 minutes for each perspective. Sound systems and covered microphones were used to accommodate readers and panelists for the event to be heard in person and recorded for other instructors to share with their classes. The event was well promoted via local news, social and radio media, and shown on informational displays throughout Holmes Community College. Forty-five seats were placed as limited seating per health restrictions, and televisions were used to showcase the poetry during the event.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This proposal responds to a request for a customized training workshop to assist in audiovisual processing and quality control procedures for DV videotape formats at Smithsonian institutions.  The workshop shall include a focus on capturing methods for DV, quality control of the result, and DV format particularities for packaging and access. The workshop will present a summary of the overall research and deliverables of the DVRescue project, which were initially developed by MIPoPS and RiceCapades with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  This work will be completed in close communication with select Smithsonian Institution Archives staff, whose digital preservation goals and workflows will set the priorities of the workshop. The project is recommended to occur in the following structure: Initial meeting with Smithsonian Institution Archives to generate a draft workshop schedule. Generation of teaching and training materials, workshop exercises, and activities responsive to Smithsonian case studies. Presentation of a custom workshop.  We recommend a consciously collaborative and responsive approach between the RiceCapades, MIPoPS, and Smithsonian Institution Archives, so that both are working in a manner that provides efficient feedback to one another.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presentation for the Maine Historical Society In 1952, Toy Len Goon, a modest widow and mother of eight, was selected as Maine Mother of the Year, and then for the national title, by the J.C. Penney Golden Rule Foundation. An immigrant from China, she came to the U.S. in 1921 as the wife of Dogan Goon, a WWI veteran and laundryman. After Dogan became disabled and unable to work, passing away in 1941, she and her children ran the laundry and household, located at 615 Forest Ave in Portland, ME. However, there is much of Toy Len Goon's story that was not told by the media coverage celebrating her honor. As one of Toy Len Goon's grandchildren, but also a cultural anthropologist, Dr. Andrea Louie places her story within a fuller context in the hopes of doing justice to her legacy as not only a mother, but a woman who broke out of a number of traditional roles, while also remaining filial to relatives back in China.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The IAS has the world's second largest collection of epigraphic squeezes, and a project is under way to digitize them. But what is an epigraphic squeeze? What's more, how does one digitize a squeeze? And why does any of this matter? In this talk, Aaron Hershkowitz will answer all of these questions and more, as he guides you through a brief history of the Institute squeeze collection and the project to digitize it. He will also explain the current workflow of the digitization project as well as its future goals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The town of Salapia, located along the Adriatic Coast of Apulia in south-eastern Italy, is recorded by the architectural historian Vitruvius as the re-founding of the Daunian town of Salapia Vetus sometime in the 1st c. BCE. The siting of this new settlement along a lagoon was fortuitous: protected by dunes from the battering Adriatic Sea, it was afforded a natural harbor that offered the inhabitants a link to wider Mediterranean networks. This lagoon, at present, is one of the top sea salt producers in the whole Mediterranean Basin, and its medieval and early modern history is marked by evidence of coordinated curation and extraction of this resource; sparser ancient evidence points perhaps to similar circumstances in the Roman and Late Antique periods. The port and its salty resources would have impelled Salapia to connect to the outside world in intriguing and significant ways. A review of the imported ceramic wares -finewares and amphorae -over these centuries makes apparent not just into what networks Salapia was integrated but also the intensity of those connections. It is possible that Salapia was a clearinghouse and node for transport of Mediterranean products to the interior of the province of Apulia. For instance, even as the Roman empire was largely defunct by the 7th c. CE, and the town plan had unraveled, African finewares -albeit in reduced numbers -still made it into the hands of the town's inhabitants, perhaps a residue of connections that were more apparent and strong in earlier centuries. Analyses of features from the urban plan also give us a more comprehensive picture of the local economy at Salapia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My talk, "The 1999 Kosovo War: Bombing, Ethnic Cleansing, and Peacekeeping," will look at the possibilities and limits of military intervention. Twenty-two years ago NATO launched Operation Allied Force, a bombing campaign that aimed to stop Serbia's brutal ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo. Meant to last a few days, Operation Allied Force instead took 78 days to force Slobodan Milosevic to terms. Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing almost succeeded - out of a population of some 2 million roughly 1.5 million Kosovars were displaced, with 900,000 becoming refugees in neighboring countries. As a result of NATO's intervention, however, most Kosovars were able to return to their homes by the end of August 1999. Operation Allied Force, while critical, marked the beginning not the end of NATO's involvement in Kosovo. Even today NATO maintains a peacekeeping presence in Kosovo.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A Union officer once remarked, "Does not a newspaper follow a Yankee march everywhere?" During the Civil War, tens of thousands of Union soldiers marched across, fought for, and garrisoned West Virginia. Apparently true to Yankee form, nearly a dozen soldier-run camp newspapers were established throughout the war across West Virginia. These Union regimental newspapers provide glimpses into soldiers' motivations and experiences in Civil War West Virginia. Soldiers espoused their patriotism and denounced the Confederacy. They monitored military developments and participated in Northern politics. They detailed the sundry experiences of camp life: baking bread, holding sermons, mourning the loss of friends. In this talk, Zac Cowsert illuminates these newspapers' political, military, and cultural themes, shedding light on how Union soldiers in West Virginia participated in and recorded their place within the wider American Civil War.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The conquest of "Nepal" (i.e., the Newar-ruled Kathmandu valley) during 1767–68 by the Gorkha king Prithvinarayan Saha (PNS) has been described as ushering in a period of major social changes and political realignments as power came to be concentrated in Gorkhali hands, to the detriment of the Newar kings of the three cities.  With support from "Tibeto-Nepali" ethnic groups of the lower hills, PNS captured Nuwakot in 1744 and Kantipur (Kathmandu) in 1768.  New and expanding regimes often seek to legitimize themselves by embracing what they take to be a compelling ideology of law and religion, one that sets the ruler up as law-giver or reformer.  In South and Southeast Asia, this has usually involved the embrace and adaptation of sacred law, especially framed as Brahmanical Dharma.  The Gorkhali regime adopted such a program (a) to participate in a prestigious Indian cosmpolitanism imprinted with Brahmanical religious ideals of piety and kingship; and (b) to provide a template for intergroup relations in a culturally, linguistically, and religiously diverse realm.  This paper begins with an analysis of the ideological features of the "Divya Upadesa" (a compilation of what purports to be PNS's memoirs and instructions, preserved in a manuscript of ca. 1800 that alludes to earlier royal law-givers) and then examines a number of royal decrees preserved as copper-plate inscriptions or documents (lal mohar) issued by PNS and subsequent Gorkhali kings prior to the Rana coup.  These provide indications of how the Gorkhali regime dealt with various social groups as they consolidated their governance.  These documents provide glimpses into how top-down attempts at putting a "sacred law" ideology into practice actually proceeded, responsive to the diverse interests and agency of the subject groups themselves.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archives in Java and Bali (not to mention in Europe) contain manuscripts of a number of texts in Old Javanese (sometimes mixed with Sanskrit verses) detailing legal "causes of action," using the Sanskrit rubric vyavahara[pada] or astadasa-vyavahara as it appears in the Sanskrit Dharmasastra literature. Apart from the work conventionally but misleadingly known as the ‘Kutara Manava', which has been published twice (Jonker's Wetboek, 1885; Hoadley &amp;amp; Hooker's Agama, 1981), in each case relying on a single manuscript, most of these have received little or no scholarly attention. Early results of my own study of these texts, however, suggest that they reflect a creative appropriation of Indic legal science as a framework for codifying indigenous Indonesian legal norms. This included a practice of formally defining criminal and civil wrongs in a casuistic manner used also for defining Sanskrit terms of legal art. Some of the Javanese expressions are more like maxims than mere titles, and can be rather colorful. Besides the Javanese terms of art, it is notable that a number of fixed expressions used in these works, mostly numbered sets (astadusta, astacora, pañcabhaya, pañcasadhara?a), have no precedent in Sanskrit sources from India and appear to derive from Sanskrit works composed in Indonesia (or at least surviving only there). Thorough study of this literature also promises to clarify a number of legal features appearing in Indonesian inscriptions, including the formulaic lists of sukhaduhkha (wrongs subject to legal penalties, over which beneficiaries of religious endowments have authority), including this use of the term sukhaduhkha itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In considering how the comparative history of ancient law expands our understanding of what law is and who makes it, three axioms apply: (1) Our access to ancient law, like ancient anything, is fragmentary and lopsided in the extreme. (2) Elite viewpoints are even more overrepresented than in later eras, obscuring the role of non-elite actors. (3) Systematic attention to hearing to "what the authors didn't mean to say" (D. Davis) about themselves and about non-elite or subaltern groups requires us to make the most of surviving documents as well as materials that are not strictly speaking legal.  Extending the horizon of "ancient law" beyond Greece and Rome brings three factors to light: (1) The formal legal definition of "citizen" status turns out to be a peculiarity of Greece and Rome. (2) One encounters an extraordinary range of unfree statuses liable to be called "slave" in English, and racial or ethnic otherness is much less a factor in some systems. (3) Comprehensive systems of religious law that transcend the boundaries of particular states and that vest authority in religious experts have been neglected in earlier studies of ancient law, and of law in general, but bear comparison with other systems of "customary law" and "international law."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Progress report on work on Old Javanese legal texts and their relations to inscriptional evidence of law in premodern Southeast Asia, including the critical edition and translation of the "Svayambhu" (an old Javanese commentarial paraphrase on the Sanskrit "Manu's Code of Law") based on three manuscripts; diplomatic editions of manuscripts of the "Astadasa Vyavahara," "Blahaning Astadasa Vyavahara," Kutara Manava," and "Svayambhu"; GREP-searchable plain text versions of all these, plus Mantrisasana and Kotaragama; and preliminary examination of other legal texts.  Recent findings provide some indications of when Manu's Code of Law began to circulate in Java, how its influence is reflected in epigraphical documents, and how Brahmanical jurisprudence was adapted by Javanese authors to local concerns and customary norms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Johannes Bronkhorst's "Greater Magadha" hypothesis calls attention to the decisive role of the urbanizing eastern Ganges valley in the religious history of ancient India. We find there the encounter of two distinct cultures: the Vedic (with its focus on worldly success and rewards in the afterlife) and the Magadhan (with its ideas of karma and rebirth, and its ascetic orders).  The Brahmins' response to this encounter was to adapt and appropriate new ideas and practices. Here, I clarify certain key aspects of how this adaptation proceeded, giving rise in fact to something one can call ‘Brahmanism', and I offer a fuller explanation of what made that adaptation so successful and durable over time. The key factors I identify are these: •Confronted by new sets of religious ideals (models of dharma) taught by unworldly ascetics (srama?as), some Brahmins decided to compete by articulating one of their own.  •Brahmin ritual authorities further sought to signal their status as religious professionals comparable to celibate mendicants by promoting the ritualized feeding of especially pious and/or learned Brahmins. •This systematic conflation of Brahminhood as a sacred profession and Brahminhood as a social status conferred by birth provided a rationale and a template for marking gradations of hierarchy and thus endowed Indian caste norms with a theological purpose and a social teleology—i.e., presenting those norms as part of a system. •This was institutionalized and given state sanction by rulers who endowed Brahmins with tax-exempt, partly autonomous foundations, and patronized Brahmanical expertise in various ritual as well "secular" matters.  These factors are what made the Indian version of caste social structure distinctive and tenacious — what made it a ‘system' with religious principles as their premises rather than merely as ex post facto justifications.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Starting from an analysis of Mimamsa hermeneutics as employed in Medhatithi's discussion of Manavadharmasastra 8.314–318 (the famous example of the "wise thief" who seeks the king's punishment as a form of penance), and Vijñanesvara's commentary on Yajñavalkyadharmasastra 2.21, which proclaims principles for dealing with conflicts of smrti-rules, taking as an illustration the problem of self-defense against a Brahmin attacker (quoting MDh 8.348–351). In the course of reconciling the legality of the king's court with Veda-based, otherworldly considerations such as sin and expiation, these passages show that punishments and penances constitute distinct forms of legal remedy serving different purposes and prescribed by different authorities; the case of the "wise thief" is but the contrived exception that proves the rule. This issue is shown to reflect the more thorough-going distinction between worldly obligations (social compacts, royal commands) and sacred obligations conveyed by Vedic injunctions. This distinction is further linked by the commentators to that between Dharmasastra and Arthasastra, subordinating the latter to the former.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Endowment grants beginning in the early centuries CE conferred upon religious professionals (Buddhist, Jain, Brahmin) exemption from tax-payments and other obligations to the king, along with stipulated rights of internal legal self-governance.  Similar grants of foundation appeared more widely in South and Southeast Asia throughout the following millennium, embodying regional variations on a general principle that religious institutions have a justifiable claim to be insulated from the fiscal regime of the state, even if they participate in the economy in other ways, not least by contributing to the welfare of the polity that supports them financially.  Such support is an intangible asset of the state, one even quantified as proportionate to the tax revenue foregone.  This status was also deemed to confer jural autonomy over the territory covered by the grant.  Grants of this type implied that there was a sacral sphere of authority conceptually distinguishable from worldly affairs, however intertwined they were.  Civil religion in ancient India and Java, then as today, was a balancing act of signaling the distinctness of religion (i.e., its transcendence) while implicating it in the public or private welfare of the patron (i.e., its immanence).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper we present the latest work on large scale, semi-automatic and quantitative analysis of the body of entities mentioned in texts from Coptic Antiquity. Unlike Greek and Roman materials, which have been studied extensively, digital treatment of Coptic data from the first millennium has lagged behind until recently, in part due to the smaller research community and the morphological complexity of the language, which is fusional and features agglutination, compounding and incorporation of nouns into complex verbs.  We will show how annotating named and non-named entities enriches Coptic corpora, including the identification of nested entities and entity linking. We will focus especially on non-named Coptic entities, which are of great interest to scholars working on monasticism and asceticism, since many central texts revolve around unnamed protagonists (e.g. ‘an ascetic') in unidentified locations (‘a monastery'). In many cases, the proportion of named entities is well below 5%.  The relevance of entity annotation is further demonstrated through visualizations of Coptic entities, which enable researchers to access a variety of information in Coptic corpora through distant reading, allowing them to explore easily types of places in different works, to get lists of nouns referring to organizations, events or animals, examine feminine vs. masculine nouns denoting people and more. From a comparative quantitative perspective, the prevalence of non-named entities of different types can also reveal dissimilarities between texts. Figure 2 juxtaposes the ranked ratio of mentions for people vs. places, illustrating which works focus on human behavior than on descriptions of environmental settings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Founding Fathers sought to emulate the Roman Republic politically; accordingly, they set out to build the nation's capital city as a "New Rome on the Potomac." By the early 19th century, however, politicians turned instead toward Greece as the chief model for their democratic experiment, and the style of government architecture followed suit. GW professor Elise Friedland will survey this "second wave of federal building" in D.C. and demonstrate how the successors of our Founders and their architects "Hellenized" the capital city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Amidst the Greek-inspired pedimental groups of the Capitol, National Archives, and Supreme Court Building and the honorific portraits of Jefferson, Lincoln, and numerous equestrian generals, the statuary program of Union Station stands out in the sculptural landscape of Washington, DC—in subject matter as well as placement.  This lecture explores the Roman models and American messages of Louis St. Gaudens' six allegorical figures that grace the attic of Union Station's façade ("The Progress of Railroading") as well as his forty six "Centurions" who guard the building's interior. To date, these statues have been neglected in scholarship, perhaps because they were created by the less famous brother of the acclaimed Gilded Age American sculptor, Augustus Saint Gaudens. The lecture presents new archival research demonstrating that, though the Union Station sculptures were completed in 1913, the placement of all and the subjects of some were inspired by Trajan's second century CE Dacian Prisoners, reused on the Arch of Constantine. This study also provides insight into the adoption and adaptation of other Classical models, the sculptor's process of creating the Classicizing statuary, and the collaboration between Louis St. Gaudens and the building's architect, Daniel H. Burnham, famed as the director of works at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and the chairman of the committee that conceived and executed the MacMillan Plan for which Washington's 1907 Union Station served as a linchpin. Finally, the lecture seeks to show that the placement and subjects of the architectural sculpture of Union Station, rare among contemporary American train depots, was purposive and learned—and designed to echo its European counterparts. Furthermore, this adoption of the Roman profusion of three-dimensional sculptures in architectural facades contributed to making America's capital "a city of statues," much like ancient Rome itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Puerto Rico Planning Board (PRPB) was established in 1942 by the last North American governor of colonial Puerto Rico, Rexford Guy Tugwell, and fellow white planners and consultants from the United States. The PRPB envisioned and planned the transformation of the colony's capital, San Juan, into a modern, industrial, and post-tropical city attractive for U.S. industrial capital. A city planned for capital and not humans came about. In this paper, I engage with Frantz Fanon's psychiatric and radical humanist work to help us rethink the history of urban planning in Puerto Rico and the United States. Drawing on Fanon, I maintain that urban planning must, above all else, "institute a general framework for de-alienating encounters". Against this Fanonian principle, I evaluate the PRPB's imperial design of San Juan during its first two decades of existence. Based on archival research, the paper documents the PRPB's slum clearance program from 1945 to 1955, a vast urban and carceral operation that displaced and re-placed thousands of Black families in the name of capital. In effect, the program, tested first in San Juan and later emulated across the U.S., ran counter to Fanon's planning principle, instituting instead the framework for urban alienation by designing a white supremacist city by and for imperial capital. With this intervention I wish to accomplish two goals: (1) center Puerto Rico in the cartographies of Black Geographies; and (2) engage with Fanon to help us theorize dehumanizing and racist planning and design in settler colonial and postcolonial cities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Exiled in death as in life, Dante has hardly rested in peace over the centuries. His bones have been entombed, condemned, contested, stolen, hidden, discovered, and reburied. They have been exhumed, examined, and relocated, even threatened with destruction by fire and bombing. Above all they have been worshiped like the relics of a saint. This talk presents the physical afterlife and graveyard history of the poet who gave the world its most enduring and influential vision of life beyond the grave with his Divine Comedy. It puts flesh on Dante's bones by showing how they are tied to major historical events in Italy and its relationship to the wider world.

		<Abstract>Dante's American fame has grown unabated since his arrival in the 19th century. The poet's presence has been felt in books, music, and classrooms, on canvases, pedestals, and stages, and,  increasingly of late, on movie, television, and gaming screens. This Dantemania largely owes to how his Divine Comedy—Hell above all—holds a mirror to American life and culture. In it, the  nation sees reflected some of its worst failings but also glimmers of beauty and hope. This talk looks at how the ethical authority and erotic charge of Dante's poem have influenced and become part of the American popular imagination.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Processing and analyzing historical manuscripts is considered one of the most challenging problems in the document analysis and recognition domain. Manuscripts written in cursive are even more difficult due to overlapping words with random spacing, irregular and varying characters' shapes, poor scan quality, and insufficient labeled data. Despite the significant achievements of deep learning approaches in computer vision, handwritten word recognition is far from solved. Most of the existing methods focus on well-segmented word datasets. In this paper, we present an empirical study investigating how well state-of-the-art deep learning models perform on detection and recognition of handwritten words in Spanish American notary records. Professional historians were involved in preparing a labeled dataset of 26,482 Spanish words employed in the experiments. We investigate the performance of some state-of-the-art models on optical character recognition (OCR) in handwritten text documents: Keras-OCR, the object detection algorithm "You Only Look Once" (YOLO), Tesseract OCR, Kraken, and Calamari-OCR. Since YOLO does not include a text recognizer, we propose YOLO-OCR, an innovative model to detect and recognize words in historical manuscripts written in Spanish. Our results show the performance of pre-trained models on our dataset and that Keras-OCR and YOLO-OCR models are highly valuable for content extraction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the end of the Civil War, the South emerged with destroyed transportation and shipping lines, a devastated economy, and no labor force. The North and South agreed slavery was an unacceptable form of American labor, but Black Americans were still viewed as an undesirable, inferior race in need of control. Over the next 100 years, the Appalachian South successfully re-established their system of racial caste under a new name, "Jim Crow," a popular antebellum term. This discussion features storyteller and spoken word artist, Mitch Capel, along with Dr. Steven Nash, Associate Professor of history at East Tennessee State University, and Freedom Stories Project Director Dr. Alicestyne Turley as we explore the roots of Appalachian Jim Crow and its impact on how the region is viewed today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The end of the Civil War granted ascendancy of industry over agriculture. This economic shift in the American ideal gave birth to a new generation of American capitalist focused on exploiting rich Appalachian resources exposed during the Civil War. The need for profits and power over-shadowed ideas of American individualism, concepts of self-sufficiency, and concern for human conservation. A new America was on the rise. Storytellers and musicians, Rhonda and Sparky Rucker; adjunct history professor, Andrew Baskin of Simmons College of Kentucky (Kentucky's only private HBCU;) and Dr. William Turner, Director of Education at the Appalachian African-American Cultural Center present a discussion exploring "profit and power" in Appalachia. The discussion is facilitated by Freedom Stories Project Director, Dr. Alicestyne Turley, and includes live Q&amp;amp;A with our viewing audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1955, Rosa Parks refused to relinquish her bus seat to a white patron, an act which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. In 1963, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and delivered his now-famous "I Have A Dream" speech. During this same time, folk music legend Pete Seeger helped popularize the Civil Rights anthem, "We Shall Overcome."  While these people and their historic acts might be well known, what is often overlooked is the role Appalachia played in this liminal period. Parks, King, and Seeger all attended training sessions at the Highlander Center in East Tennessee, and twelve Black students from Clinton, Tennessee, became the first in the South to integrate a public high school. The Birmingham Campaign in Alabama is part of Appalachian history, and marches took place across the region.  In this public discussion in our Freedom Stories series, we hear from musician, storyteller, and educator Reggie Harris; civil rights activists Ann Beard Grundy and Charles Nebett; and Dr. Daryl Carter, Associate Dean for Equity and Inclusion for the College of Arts and Sciences and director of Black American Studies at East Tennessee State University as we explore the events of the Civil Rights Movement, particularly as they pertain to Appalachia, and ask ourselves, "Are we there yet?"</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1776, America's forebears declared that "all men are created equal." Twelve years later, they developed their plan for "a more perfect Union." While not unprecedented, these acts were unique enough to be dubbed the "American Experiment." Such ideals are still venerated, but as America moves toward its 250th anniversary, we must face the difficult truths which underpin these concepts. Those who declared "all men are created equal" did not include enslaved persons. Those who formed "a more perfect Union" counted Black people as three-fifths human.  Fortunately, the shortcomings of the past need not dictate the future, and the American Experiment is not complete. In the twelfth and final event in our Freedom Stories series, we will explore ways to engage in constructive dialogue and present tips on how to use storytelling to advance racial justice. This special two-hour presentation will include performance and discussion from Mzuri Moyo Aimbaye, Founder, President, and CEO of Healing Through the Sound of Music and creator of the one-woman show, "The Fannie Lou Hamer Story;" Lecia Brooks, Chief of Staff at the Southern Poverty Law Center; Trina Jackson, Education Team Coordinator at the Highlander Center; and Kiran Singh Sirah, President of the International Storytelling Center. Their discussion will be moderated by Freedom Stories Project Director, Dr. Alicestyne Turley.   Together, we can continue unearthing the stories which surround us, and more fully realize our forebears' ideals.  This event is made possible by funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and with the support of our friends at the National Association of Black Storytellers – NABS, Green McAdoo Cultural Center, Appalachian African American Cultural Center, Black/White Dialogue, Black in Appalachia, ETSU Leadership and Civic Engagement, Heritage Alliance, Langston Centre, McKinney Center, Northeast Tennessee Tourism, and Historic Jonesborough.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How did issues of borders, boundaries, and jurisdictions play out during the Age of Revolutions 200 years ago? The history of borderlands—from Argentina to Brazil, and Mexico up to Canada—is riddled with questions about immigration, labor practices, Indigenous rights, the arms trade, resource extraction, and cartography. In this program, scholars Brian DeLay, University of California, Berkeley; Jordana Dym, Skidmore College; and Mónica Ricketts, Temple University, explored this history, and how these issues continue to shape our world today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeology in the Middle East has involved, for more than 200 years, foreign-led excavations hiring teams of site workers from the local communities in the region. These locally-hired laborers have carried out the bulk of the shoveling, sifting, and dirt-hauling for most of the archaeological work in the region, but rarely appear in publications or even excavation archives. Their expertise and their perspectives on Middle Eastern archaeology have largely disappeared. But through a combination of ethnographic work, social network analysis, and emancipatory photography, I present some ways of seeing the often-invisible knowledge that local laborers possess about the archaeological work which has relied on them for so long. These strategies also suggest how we might adjust our excavation methods to be more inclusive, and therefore more produce a more accurate and thorough archaeological record.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The medieval Japanese poet and courtier Fujiwara no Teika (also called Sadaie, 1162-1241) served as co-compiler of the eighth imperial collection of waka poetry, Shin Kokinshu and is said to have compiled the anthology Hyakunin isshu, basis of the well-known card game.  Teika wrote over four thousand waka poems in his lifetime, some of which are regarded today as the very best in this distinguished canon.  Through his diary, Meigetsuki, and other records, we have a tremendous amount of Teika's activities, lifestyle, and idiosyncratic personality.  Perhaps we know more about Teika than any other individual in classical Japan.  Many samples of his distinctive calligraphy have survived and have been coveted by collectors and practitioners of the tea ceremony for centuries.  In this talk, given in English, Professor Atkins will lead us through a tour of Teika's life, highlighting important events such as the Genpei War of 1180-1185, the Jokyu Disorder of 1221, the places he lived and visited during his lifetime, and Teika's literary activities, including his most highly regarded poems.  Who was Teika?  Why is he still famous today?  How did he shape our view about classical Japanese culture?  All of these questions and more will be addressed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How can we excavate experiences of enslaved people from archives that systematically exclude enslaved voices, while negotiating the demands of a liberal sensibility that requires subjects to speak for themselves? In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan. They had been caught, terrifyingly, between two factions struggling over who would succeed their dead master, a Né (or Yi) native hereditary chieftain, as the sovereign of his extensive domain. Their plaint, which named the slaves as its collective author, was written in Chinese, a language they could neither speak nor write. This paper traces their footsteps as they accompanied their master's widow to the prefectural capital, found a cut-rate litigation master to fashion their plaint, then dispersed through the city on errands for their master's widow. I think about how the slaves' own form of spatial literacy, developed through their service in their master's house and participation in his rituals, might have helped them read and navigate the unfamiliar city. Thinking through the specificities of how slaves became writers and readers also helps better delineate the shape of slavery in Né places, which have served as China's designated "slave societies," despite widespread slavery in every region and economic sector of the Empire. I argue that the native chieftain system itself became a system of bondage in Qing society, confining Né and other ‘non-Chinese' to mountain enclaves while extracting their wealth and using their lives in military actions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan, the immediate superior of their dead master, Nuo Jiayou, a Né (or Yi) native chieftain. They had been caught between two factions struggling over who would succeed their master as the sole owner of all the lands and peoples within his extensive domain. Their plaint was written in Chinese, which they could neither speak nor write. This paper traces their footsteps as they traveled to the prefectural capital and found a translator and litigation master to fashion their plaint. I show how the slaves' own form of spatial literacy, developed through participation their master's rituals, may have helped them read and navigate the unfamiliar city. Thinking through the specificities of how slaves became writers and readers also helps better delineate the shape of slavery in Né places, which became the designated "slave societies" of Chinese social science despite ubiquitous slavery in every region and economic sector of the empire. I argue that the native chieftain system itself became a system of bondage in Qing society, confining Né and other indigenous peoples to mountain enclaves while extracting their wealth and using their lives in military actions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1533, Lady Qu, native prefect of Wuding Prefecture in northern Yunnan, sponsored the inscription of two texts on a cliff face at the center of her domain. One was in Nasu, the language of the ruling lineage; the other was in Chinese. Both commemorated the long, powerful line of Né (or Yi) native chieftains to which Lady Qu was heir. Yet they gave contradictory accounts of the forms of chiefly succession, sources of political authority, and geopolitical position of the native domain. The inscriptions show that chiefly sovereignty was neither merely embodied in ancestral authority nor simply endowed by the emperor. Sovereignty—particularly that of a female chieftain—was the capacity to master both modes of self-description while embodying their incompatibility. While we often understand colonialism through power-laden projects of translation, Lady Qu's inscriptions give evidence that Ming colonization of the southwest might require a different approach. Native chieftains were often intermediaries in encounters between indigenous peoples and imperial agents, garrisoned soldiers, and other migrants. Rather than merely understanding these elites as translators and mediators of colonialism, we might also ask how they emphasized and strategically deployed cultural and linguistic differences to achieve ends of their own.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The lower Gila River in southwestern Arizona is renowned for the sheer abundance and uniqueness of the petroglyphs adorning the cliffs and buttes lining it. Places such as the Painted Rock Petroglyph Site and Sears Point – both of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places – and a growing campaign to establish a national monument or conservation area attest to the richness, value, and significance of this cultural landscape.  Lesser known, though, are the Indigenous communities responsible for populating the landscape with such a stunning array of images. The Hohokam and Patayan cultural traditions are often mentioned, but the relationship between them and each's role in constructing the cultural landscape we see today has long puzzled researchers.  Fortunately, following four years of intensive archaeological survey, and the inventory and analysis of over 30,000 \ petroglyphs, a clearer picture is emerging. This presentation will highlight some of what this work has revealed. Particular attention will be given to both the petroglyphs and the nearby settlements in an effort to better understand the people behind it all.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With its varied topography and stark contrast between riverine and desert environs, western Arizona witnessed the flourishing of multiple cultural traditions that followed related yet unique historic trajectories. Archaeologists learned long ago that, in places, the material remains of these distinct traditions overlap on the landscape. This scenario is quite evident along the lower Gila River, where elements of Patayan and Hohokam material culture are often found together or in close proximity. How to explain the "mixing"? In this presentation, Aaron Wright reviews preliminary findings of a four-year survey and documentation of over 150 archaeological sites in the Dendora Valley and surrounding area that show what the archaeological record looks like when worlds collide.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At Racing Magpie, we are dedicated to elevating and amplifying Native and other artists and their communities through educational, cultural, and research programs, all in the Lakota spirit of being a good relative. As part of that being a good relative this program will reimagine the Lakota winter camp model of problem solving and community building in today's world by examining the deeper reasons why Lakota people do things the way they do and why they interact with the universe around them. Events will be free to the public with limited space available and will target Lakota community members as both presenters and attendees. As plants and trees focus their energy on building strength and growing from the roots during the winter, our community will join to strengthen and grow together each year through sharing and learning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper describes optimization of a computational method for representing semantic information in Latin texts and application of the method to identifying intertextual relationships of literary significance. The distributional hypothesis in linguistics holds that the meaning of a word can be inferred from the contexts in which it is used (Firth); the development of effective methods for computing distributional representations known as word embeddings has revolutionized natural language processing research over the past decade (Mikolov et al., Devlin et al.). We optimize a word embedding model for Latin and use that model to improve existing methods for intertextual search through incorporation of semantic matching...</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Chassica Kirchhoff has given four virtual lectures inspired by the research undertaken and new cataloging protocols implemented during this NEH SCHC project. The NEH SCHC grant was acknowledged during each of the lectures, as these examinations would not have taken place without this grant. In June 2021, Dr. Kirchhoff presented "Puzzling Paintings in Light: A Series of Elizabethan Stained-Glass Panels at the DIA," a talk sharing a series of 14 heraldic stained-glass panels from the Elizabethan manor of Warkworth in Northamptonshire that reside at the DIA. These complex renaissance paintings in light embody sixteenth-century innovations in the glazier's art as well as venerable techniques that date to the high Middle Ages. These works were among the 39 stained glass objects that Dr. Kirchhoff examined alongside Megan Reddicks Pignataro and Allison Slenker in December 2020 and January 2021.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk focuses on the cesarean operation during the Enlightenment, when Catholic priests began to theorize that fetal ensoulment might occur as early as conception. Clergy attempted to prove this theory by removing embryos via caesarean surgery. Because historians of medicine have tended to omit religious sources, they have long overlooked these—surgical—origins of Catholic claims on the unborn. The first chapter offers an first in-depth English-language examination of Joaquín Castellot's translation of Francesco Cangiamila's Embriologia Sacra—a foundational work in embryological (embryo) science, and argues that it has been overlooked in that field due to its religious underpinnings.  Sacred Embryology was the first to insist that Catholic priests should be required to perform cesarean operations on dead and dying women, in order to baptize the infants in their wombs. While others have analyzed the masculinization, medicalization, and racialization of reproductive medicine, this talk suggests that we can also consider Cangiamila's tome figures as a foundational work in the "spiritualization" of obstetrics—that is, the reinterpretation of the caesarean operation in the service of Catholic doctrine.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the eighteenth century, Catholic authorities became increasingly preoccupied with unborn life. Cesarean surgery was a key part of this effort. Medical humanities scholars Elizabeth O'Brien and Altina Hoti will discuss their NEH- sponsored translation project on obstetric writings, placing Indigenous and multi-ethnic Mexico at the heart of global histories of fetal personhood, addressing why this history of forced surgeries continues to affect Church and State approaches to reproductive politics today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Young Appalachian Story Summit is a young adult-led event that focuses on a critical issue: how young adults can use storytelling as a leadership tool to create Appalachia's future. Summit participants have the opportunity to hear from diverse voices within Appalachia; to understand how storytelling can help them take action in their own communities; and to join a network of like-minded young Appalachians to collaborate with beyond the event.   The 2021 Summit, Crossroads, featured six presenters representing a variety of personal and professional backgrounds. They led workshops and participated in a panel discussion answering audience questions. In the video they are, from left to right:  --Jose Castillo: Founder of Spark Plaza and Flavor, Inc.  --Jenny Brock: City Commissioner and former Mayor, City of Johnson City --Katelyn Yarbrough: Innkeeper at the Historic Eureka Inn and founder and owner of Side Hustle Custom Bakery --Kiran Singh Sirah: President, International Storytelling Center --Valentina Escobar-Gonzalez: Founder and owner of Beyond Engagement Social Media Solutions  --Dr. Alicestyne Turley: Freedom Stories Project Director, International Storytelling Center</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cynthia Haven (Stanford University) discusses her recent book Czeslaw Milosz: A California Life with William Nichell (University of Chicago). The event was held at the Franke Institute for the Humanities, located at 1100 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637, on October 28, 2021.  About the book  Czeslaw Milosz, one of the greatest poets and thinkers of the past hundred years, is not generally considered a Californian. But the Nobel laureate spent four decades in Berkeley--more time than any other single place he lived--and he wrote many of his most enduring works there. This is the first book to look at his life through a California lens. Filled with original research and written with the grace and liveliness of a novel, it is both an essential volume for his most devoted readers and a perfect introduction for newcomers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A continuous training in seafaring for a duration of eight weeks and harvesting of local materials needed to maintain, repair, and eventual construction of a hut was a parallel activity of the program. These programs have ran throughout the year but the last eight weeks training cycle was carried out from mid July to early September 2021. For the seafaring component, participants were given basic introduction to the various sets and skills of knowledge that are essential to seafaring. These include basic understanding of land, ocean, and stars that are used on traditional navigation.  Seafaring training in celestial navigation and canoe application workshops and lectures as well as actual hands on training took place. Canoe house structure- harvesting local materials and minor repair and maintenance took place during the reporting period.</Abstract>

This approach also allows for interesting information on symbolism linked to the feminine, and some lesser known, but very important historical information on the lives of women artists during various eras.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In observance of National Hispanic Heritage Month, the Faculty Advisory Committee hosted Chicana poet and novelist, Sandra Cisneros, best known for her debut novel, The House on Mango Street. In preparation for her visit, the Faculty Advisory Committee allocated NEH funds to purchase a selection of Cisneros's works. Faculty assigned these texts in designated English, Spanish, history, and humanities courses. These students later had the opportunity to meet Cisneros and discuss her work in small class settings. Cisneros also delivered a lecture for the broader community, in which she reflected on selections from her recent memoir, A House of My Own, and fielded questions from the audience. NEH Challenge Grant funds provided for the costs of printing, transportation, hotel, and speaker fees. Grant funds also paid for bi-lingual advertisement in the Orlando Sentinel newspaper and through our local public radio station, WMFE. We also collaborated with the Seminole State Speakers Series in hosting a reception and book signing funded by the Central Florida Educators (CFE) Credit Union. The event was successful in garnering a large, diverse audience that enhanced the profile of the college as well as the supportive efforts of the NEH. Attendance: over 300 people</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of a series of programs offered in conjunction with the museum's upcoming exhibition, Opium: The Business of Addiction. Keefe and Hughes examine stories of greed, deception, excess and legal battles in the pharmaceutical industry. Keefe's book follows the rise and fall of the Sacklers at the helm of Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, while Hughes's book documents a similar trajectory by entrepreneur John Kapoor, founder of Insys Therapeutics and maker of Subsys. The books reveal that OxyContin and Subsys are highly-addictive opioids that were aggressively and deceitfully marketed, and which are directly linked to today's opioid epidemic.  Local access TV recorded this talk.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent discussions of animal communication and the evolution of language have advocated adopting a ‘pragmatics-first' approach. On this approach, "a more productive framework" for identifying precursors of language in animal communication should be "pragmatics, the field of linguistics that examines the role of context in shaping the meaning of linguistic utterances" (Wheeler &amp;amp; Fischer 2012: 203). It is reasonable to expect such an approach to yield a feasible characterization of Protolanguage – a hypothetical stage between animal communication systems as we know them and human natural languages. After distinguishing two different conceptions of pragmatics that advocates of the pragmatics-first approach have implicitly relied on (one Carnapian, the other Gricean), I argue that neither conception is adequate to this task. My main aim in this paper is to motivate – and begin to articulate – an intermediary conception of pragmatics whose scope is narrower than Carnapian pragmatics but broader than Gricean pragmatics. This conception, I argue, would allow us to characterize a stage at which our pre-human ancestors moved significantly beyond the merely coded communication that is often claimed to be characteristic of nonhuman animals' use of communicative signals. This, despite not yet being capable of fully Gricean communication. On the intermediary pragmatics-first approach I advocate, users of Protolanguage would have learned to bring a basic capacity to display to each other – and recognize each other's – states of mind directly to bear on their use of communicative signals. They would have learned to engage in what I describe as psychologically mediated, proto-Gricean communication. Proper understanding of the character of such communication should, I believe, reveal the advantages of Protolanguage over existing animal communication systems. It could also contribute to our understanding of what it would have taken for Protolanguage users to move further in the direc</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1904, the American colonial government in the Philippines established a leprosarium on the island of Culion, which is located southwest of Manila, the Philippine capital. American health officials considered Hansen's disease (also known as leprosy) as a major threat to public health. In this presentation, I will discuss how Filipinos responded to the policy. Many of the afflicted Filipinos resisted the implementing authorities because they were treated like criminals. The criminalization of disease is one of the broad issues in the global history of public health that are illuminated in this study. This issue is relevant to public health incidents in the twenty-first century, especially to the COVID-19 pandemic.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Among the many legacies of The New Deal's WPA, the Slave Narratives of the Federal Writers' Project hold an unprecedented place in our history. Capturing more than 2,300 first-person accounts of formerly enslaved people that were taken between 1936 and 1938, this collection of life histories, testimonies, and reminiscences constitutes the single most important documentation of a complex and fundamental chapter in America's past. For historians, the significance of this collection is profound. For descendants of formerly enslaved people seeking to fill in stories of their ancestors, it provides dramatic evidence. And for everyone of any racial or ethnic background, these firsthand accounts of American slavery paint a vivid picture of a facet of our history that is otherwise largely erased.  The Center for Brooklyn History hosted panelist Clint Smith, staff writer at The Atlantic and author of the recent, widely acclaimed book How the Word is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America; historian John Edgar Tidwell who has written extensively on Sterling A. Brown, FWP's national editor of Negro Affairs; and historian Catherine Stewart, author of the 2016 book Long Past Slavery: Representing Race in the Federal Writers' Project, for this conversation about the impact and import of the Federal Writers' Project and Its Ex-Slave Narrative Collection. As Congress continues to debate a proposal for a 21st century Federal Writers' Project Act, the panelists explored the urgency of continued efforts to archive the lived experiences and underrepresented stories of our diverse country. The program was moderated by Peabody Award-winning journalist and documentarian Brian Palmer.  This program was made possible through funding by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, in connection with the NEH Summer Institute on the New Deal Era's Federal Writers' Project presented by Long Island University and Texas A&amp;amp;M University - Commerce. It is also part</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Armenian Genocide of 1915 is one of the most horrifying tragedies of the twentieth century. The exterminationist campaign caught its victims in total shock, who lacked any preparations to stand against or avoid it. As I show in my broader research the catastrophe occurred immediately after a period when the Ottoman Armenian communities and their political elites were the most optimistic about the prospects of the Armenian people in the empire. Even after the First World War broke out, the commonly held view among the leading Armenian circles was that "before the Armenian people was rising a new, unlimited and fascinating horizon."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As a follow-up to the ILR Spring Series course Remaking Our Legacy, this "Ethics Bowl" One-Shot session will provide participants the opportunity to engage in a cross-generational dialogue with members of Santa Fe College's Ethics Bowl Team.  Topics will be drawn from this year's National Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl competition and will include an array of challenging ethical issues that are in keeping with the Remaking Our Legacy course presentations.    ILR students will learn about and engage in an alternative form of debate—Ethics Bowl.  Created at the intercollegiate level in 1993, Ethics Bowl is a team competition built around thoughtful analysis and respectful dialogue on some of the most challenging ethical problems facing individuals, communities, and our world today.  Ethics Bowl competitions focus on rational and civil discourse and help students gain valuable skills in critical thinking, public speaking, and team building.  Join Dr. Ann Thebaut, Santa Fe College ethics professor and Coach of SF's Ethics Bowl Team, along with the SF Ethics Bowl Team, as they engage ILR students in thoughtful, lively discussion about some timely ethical topics—Ethics-Bowl style!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Marrying a doctor became an aspirational goal for many young women in the twentieth century United States. For those who succeeded in securing a physician, however, married life was often hard work. From fundraising and engaging in political activism to answering patients' phone calls, the labor of the doctor's wife was an essential part of the history of American medicine. My new research reveals that spouses of physicians had an under-appreciated but significant impact on the growth, reception, and reform of the medical profession.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>the Mapping Tahlequah History Workshop was held on Monday, April 4, 2022 in the Webb Tower and room 614 of the W. Roger Webb Educational Technology Center (Webb) at Northeastern State University (NSU) on the Tahlequah campus between 9 am and 4 pm Central Time.  Mapping Tahlequah History (MTH) traces historic sites of Tahlequah and contiguous regions in Green Country to underscore the significance of their intricate histories, relying on reading place and research with the Special Collections and Archives at Northeastern State University (NSU). This project, facilitated by Dr. Farina King and Dr. John McIntosh, enables students to apply their learning in historical interpretation and design to a digital mapping history project. MTH serves the public by contributing to accessible analysis of local histories, while featuring NSU students' original research on historic sites in the area. This workshop brings different partners, collaborators, and community together to consider past, current, and future developments of the MTH project. This workshop is open and free to the community and public. The keynote talk was held from 10:30 AM to 11:45 AM featuring Dr. Brenden W. Rensink's "Reconnecting the Public with Their Pasts through Digital History." The keynote talk was available virtually as well as in-person.  Most sessions of the workshop were held in person in the Webb Tower between 9 am and 4 pm, but people were welcome to come and go as they needed. There were two sessions that were available virtually as well as in-person (meeting in room 614 of the Webb building), which include:  A conversation with Dr. Brenden W. Rensink about "Reconnecting the Public With Their Pasts Through Digital History" from 10:30 am to 11:45 am  A panel about Cherokee Landscapes and Language with Dr. Justin McBride and Ia Bull from 1:40 pm to 2:30 pm</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Monuments are often ignored; what they commemorate tends to be forgotten a generation or two after their construction. Sometimes, though, their meanings become matters of urgent debate. This webinar will begin with an overview of how monumentalization has manifested across different societies, asking: what do monuments do, and why do we make them? In the context of ideas of collective memory, heritage, history, we will then consider recent crises in the U.S. and Europe. This series is a partnership between the National Humanities Center and the National Council for the Social Studies and is generously sponsored by the Library of Congress' Teaching for Primary Sources grant program. Subjects: History; Monuments; Social History; Cultural Identity; Cultural Memory</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this webinar, we will examine the construction of race through the religious beliefs and practices of English Virginians. The seventeenth century was a critical time in the development and articulation of racial ideologies—ultimately in the idea of "hereditary heathenism," the notion that Africans and Indians were incapable of genuine Christian conversion. In Virginia in particular, English settlers initially believed that native people would quickly become Christian and would form a vibrant partnership with English people. After vicious Anglo-Indian violence dashed those hopes, English Virginians used Christian rituals like marriage and baptism to exclude first Indians and then Africans from the privileges enjoyed by English Christians—including freedom.

		<Abstract>How did the Black Panther Party influence the world? We will examine the monumental impact of the Black Panther Party (BPP) on non-African American groups both domestically and abroad as a model for grassroots community organizing to address disparities and disadvantages. Moreover, the lesson will demonstrate why and how groups emulated the BPP as a means for political and social change and will highlight the transnational importance of African American grassroots political activism. Global Call of Power to the People is a study of groups in Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Israel, Palestine, Italy, and India that did not have any direct contact with the BPP but chose to create movements in their countries modeled after the Panthers grassroots community organizing and racial coalition strategies.

		<Abstract>In 2010 legal scholar Alfred Brophy wrote, "Something that is often missing from ‘reparations talk' is a specific plan for repairing past tragedies." In this webinar, we fill Brophy's lacuna, engaging in a conversation over a detailed redress plan for the atrocities visited upon multiple generations of Black American descendants of persons enslaved in the United States. The detailed redress plan, drawn from our book From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century, will explore the following aspects of an African American reparations project: who will be eligible, what is the size of the fund, how the fund will be distributed, and how the fund will be financed. The case for Black reparations will be made not only on the basis of the atrocity of slavery but also nearly a century of legal segregation accompanied by white terrorist campaigns and ongoing harms including mass incarceration, police executions of unarmed Blacks, and discrimination in multiple arenas.

		<Abstract>The past several years has produced convincing evidence for Epipaleolithic (or earlier) occupations of some Mediterranean islands. Yet, conventional wisdom was that most islands were only occupied during the Neolithic or later, and were peripheral to regional cultural developments during prehistory. Cyprus has strong evidence for an Epipaleolithic presence, beginning with the occupation of Akrotiri Aetokremnos at ca. 12,000 B.P., and perhaps earlier, bringing it into the forefront of research on Late Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherer and Early Neolithic movements and colonization, as well as their associated technological innovations and impacts on shaping newly settled landscapes. Evidence for Epipalaeolithic occupation of Cyprus remains limited, however, with only a handful of sites known and only one chronometrically dated. Here, I highlight discoveries from 2018 and 2019 survey seasons by the Ancient Seafaring Explorers of Cyprus Project (ASEC), which documented several probable Epipaleolithic sites and compare this to what we know about the Epipalaeolithic on the mainland, especially in Jordan.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Few cultural developments have been as well-studied as when people began living in villages and producing their own food. Yet in Southwest Asia, during the preceding ten thousand years of prehistory, Epipalaeolithic (23,000-11,500 cal BP) hunter-gatherers initiated and experienced dramatic cultural transformations that included building the earliest permanent houses and villages, storing food, developing a rich and diverse artistic repertoire, establishing wide-ranging social networks, intensifying plant use, domesticating animals, and creating strong ties to specific places in the landscape as evidenced by some of the world's earliest aggregation sites and cemeteries. These hunter-gatherer groups had highly complex, knowledgeable and dynamic relationships with their local environments. Ongoing work in Jordan and Cyprus is revising our knowledge of these periods with evidence that markers of social complexity have an earlier foundation and challenging our long-held assumptions about how hunter-gatherers here perceived and constructed spaces and places, and the intersections between them. Investigation of human-environment interactions, the role of technological knowledge in creating social networks, the use of large-scale aggregation sites, and symbolic features of human burials, for example, all support a longer chronology of cultural development and continuity and in situ change among hunter-gatherers here that significantly predates the Neolithic. Indeed, it suggests that the features and practices often considered hallmarks of the Neolithic were enacted within a hunter-gatherer world and worldview.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Hopewell (ca. 1 to 400 CE) monumental earthworks were expressions of a brilliant florescence of art, architecture, ceremony, and interregional interaction unparalleled in contemporary North America. "Hopewell" societies participated in a sophisticated interaction sphere that likely involved a mixture of gift-giving, pilgrimage offerings, extraordinary journeys by individuals and small groups, and trade. These places of aggregation, celebration, and renewal are now severed from these functions. It is no longer possible to experience and investigate the original forms of these monuments. The barriers of time and space limit various audiences (e.g., tribal citizens, K-12 schools, researchers) from being able to interact with and learn from these earthworks. New digital technologies provide opportunities to overcome these challenges through virtual Hopewellian built environments.  The Newark Earthworks, the preeminent example of Hopewellian geometric earthworks, consists of four large enclosures connected by avenues of parallel walls enveloping more than 3.9 mi2. The complex inscribes intricate knowledge of the celestial ecosystem into the site geometry. Precisely inscribing these alignments on the ground, required extensive planning and exquisite knowledge of the sky's various cycles.  The Applied Anthropology Laboratories and the Institute for Digital Intermedia Arts, in partnership with the Ohio History Connection, The Works: Ohio Center for History, Art &amp;amp; Technology, and a project Advisory Board, with a Level II Digital Humanities Advancement Grant (HAA-269032-20), develop an interactive 3D simulation to advance scholarship on, and public engagement with the Newark Earthworks, specifically, and Ohio's Hopewell ceremonial centers, generally. We present an introductory overview of Virtual World Heritage Ohio and a discussion of our progress to-date.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk will report progress on several NCHS projects at the University of Kentucky in the context of EduceLab, an emerging programmatic and instrumentation ecosystem.  The infrastructure platform, named after the verb "to educe" (meaning to bring out from data, or to develop something that is latent but is not, on its own, explicit) is organized into deployment clusters, which broaden its use and facilitate training for future innovations. The primary deployment clusters are tied together by equipment and expertise in data science, recognizing that we are shifting to a "fourth paradigm" in scientific inquiry revolving around data analysis at scale.  Progress in areas such as "virtual unwrapping" and AI-inspired solutions to NCHS problems will make the case for continued interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment in EduceLab infrastructure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk discusses how digital numismatics facilitates new research into ancient Antioch in Syria. My monograph, Antioch in Syria: A History from Coins (300 BCE-450 CE) (Cambridge University Press, 2021), critically reassesses the capital city by applying the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis and digital mapping to a database of 300,000 coin finds. Although Antioch's prominence is famous, a quantitative analysis of coins minted in the city and excavated throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East exposes the gradations of imperial power and local agency mediated within its walls. As imperial governments capitalized upon Antioch's location and amenities, the citizens developed in their own distinct identities and agency – both financial and political. This research serves as the foundation for the collaborative online exhibit, SYRIOS: Studying Urban Relationships and Identity over Ancient Syria (https://syrios.uh.edu), which teaches public audiences about how digital humanities methodologies enhance the value of coins as historical evidence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the twentieth century, hundreds of communities in the American West disappeared, and no one seemed to care. River development projects – massive dams built for irrigation, hydroelectricity, and flood control – displaced or destroyed towns, tribal communities, farmsteads, and ranches on the Snake, Colorado, Columbia, and other rivers. Recovering these lost histories is the mission of The Atlas of Drowned Towns, a multimedia and multi-platform public history project (drownedtowns.com). This talk with introduce and explain the objectives and vision of The Atlas of Drowned Towns, exploring some of the questions lurking under the surface of reservoirs: How did these displaced communities respond to their removal – with enthusiasm, acquiescence, or/and resistance? Why did they respond in those ways? What was it like to live in and have to leave these places? And what can we in the 21st century learn from the history of displacement, as we face a future that threatens more such displacement?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Fifteenth Annual Father Eugene Cotter Memorial Lecture at Seton Hall University. Paper abstract: You may not immediately associate subjects like ancient Mediterranean history with cutting edge technology, but indeed Classicists have often been early adopters of digital tools and techniques. This application of digital methodology to Classical material can take place in the realm of research —one recent example is an article in Nature about a project applying machine learning to the restoration of fragmentary texts — but it is also very important for pedagogy. The Krateros Project, which aims to digitize a large collection of "squeezes" (paper negatives of inscribed surfaces), is deeply embedded within that framework, following in the footsteps of projects past and setting the groundwork for others yet to come. In this talk Dr. Aaron Hershkowitz, Project Manager for Krateros, will discuss the digital ancient world landscape and the position of Krateros within that landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Learn about a variety of outreach initiatives featuring digitized newspapers as panelists from state awardees of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) share about their work to highlight digital collections. The National Endowment for the Humanities and Library of Congress developed NDNP for state partners to digitize historic newspapers from across the country and make them freely accessible in the Chronicling America (chroniclingamerica.loc.gov) newspaper database, which now has over 19 million digitized pages. This session brings together partners from Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia each presenting on a unique outreach project for their digital newspaper collection. Hear about social media campaigns, online exhibits, K-12 history day resources, volunteer research and transcription events, and more that can be modeled to feature your own institution's digital and analog collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Visual art played a major role in expressing the values of revolutions from the United States to South America. Works of art both reinforced and challenged the racial hierarchies (or castes) that these revolutions struggled against. Examples include Paul Revere's engraving of the Boston Massacre identifying Crispus Attucks as one of its victims as well as the casta paintings of colonial Latin America, which illustrate different racial mixtures resulting from unions between Spaniards and Native peoples. In this program held at the National Museum of Mexican Art, photographer, printmaker, and installation artist Delilah Montoya conversed with curator Mia Lopez to explore the intersection of art, race, and revolution across the Americas.</Abstract>

Scholars Celso Thomas Castilho, Marcela Echeverri Muñoz, and Chernoh Sesay Jr., discussed controversies over the role of Indigenous and African enslaved peoples in the formation of new nations and governments throughout the Western Hemisphere. They examined choices of the period regarding rights, liberties, and citizenship of formerly enslaved peoples, and how the repercussions of these decisions extend to the present day.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Roman ("Gypsy") musicians constitute at least 80% of Turkey's professional musician laborers.  Less well-known is the fact that most of these musicians are members of long-term professional musician families whose origins hail from outside of Turkey:  mostly Greece and Bulgaria. In addition their musical training is structured by in-family esnaf or guild-training methods, which produce musicians that can serve multiple musical genres (regional/folk/ritual, entertainment, studio, state ensembles, court/urban as well as folk). What are the features of this training that enable musicians to survive today's changing economic structures and diverse political networks? How do their layered identities as Roma, Turkish, Selanikli muhacir/Bulgarian göçmen also intersect with their regional affiliations? How are such affiliations performed in strategic responses to economic conditions and client-patron relationships?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1905, American colonial officials established a leprosarium in Culion, an island southwest of Manila. To safeguard public health, the American colonial state implemented the Segregation Law (1907), which forcibly removed Filipinos suspected of having Hansen's disease from their homes and confined those who tested positive for the disease to Culion. This presentation, which is based on a larger book project, will focus on the impact of segregation on the afflicted individuals and their families.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), founded in 1964, became famous, or infamous, over the decades primarily for its militants and its politicians. There was another group in the organization, however, that was less well known but no less important: PLO researchers. In 1965, the PLO established a Research Center in Beirut, Lebanon, dedicated to carefully analyzing what it referred to as "the Palestine Problem," a crucial element of which was "knowing the enemy." This meant researching Jews, Judaism, Zionism, and Israel. Professor Gribetz introduces the PLO Research Center and discuss the importance of this group of activist researchers and intellectuals on the history of the PLO.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the summer of 2021, the Union of European Football Associations rejected a request to light up Munich's Allianz Arena in the colors of the rainbow during a match between Germany and Hungary. UEFA asserted that the gesture was seen as a deliberate critique of Hungary's anti-LGBTQ legislation. Their decision, they concluded, was based on their belief that "the rainbow is not a political symbol." Focusing on an early seventeenth-century emblem designed for a Stuart king and prince, this presentation will demonstrate how, to the contrary, rainbows have always been political. They were and remain signs of hope, justice, mercy, and political power.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>WVU History doctoral student Luke Masa presented on his research and the essays he wrote for the 5th cycle second no cost extension.  Newspaper essays written by Masa included: Williamson Enterprise/Progressive West Virginian, Belington Progressive, Wheeling Majority, New Dominion/Daily New Dominion, Harpers Ferry Times, Martinsburg World/Daily World/Evening World and Martinsburg Gazette/Daily Gazette [1886-1887].  Chronology spanned the late 1870s-1920s.  Geographical coverage = WV's eastern and northern panhandles, southern coalfields, and north central counties  Often explicitly political, usually advocated for internal improvements. Fiercely locally-oriented and boosterist.  Questions Masa asked and answered in his research were: Who's in town? What are they up to?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This webinar occurred outside of the grant period, but speaks to the continued interest in the DVRescue project and archivists seeking to learn how to use the DVRescue toolkit.  This webinar will be a training workshop to assist in audiovisual processing and quality control procedures for DV videotape formats at archival institutions. The workshop shall include a focus on capturing methods for DV, quality control of the result, and DV format particularities for packaging and access. Participants will gain hands-on experience learning how to use the DVRescue toolkit for capture, quality control analysis, resolving artifacts, packaging videos for long term preservation, as well as other general best practices for working with DV. In addition, presenters will go over a summary of the overall research and deliverables of the DVRescue project — which were initially developed by MIPoPS and RiceCapades with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  Presented as part of the Association of Moving Image Archivists AV Open Source Tools webinar series.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Yellowstone has a rich and varied history that can be told in many ways. This presentation will detail parts of Yellowstone's history beginning with the introduction of the automobile to park environs. As access to the park changed, so did advertising and outreach to diversify and increase attendance. Through varying perspectives that are portrayed in newspapers, travel brochures, advertisements, personal narratives, and other park based ephemera, a colorful history and deeper story will emerge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this talk to undergraduate and graduate students, we cover the seven major steps in building a collaborative digital humanities project: 1) Hone Research Question; 2) Assemble Evidence &amp;amp; Scholarship; 3) Dream Big; 4) Prepare Data Set; 5) Create Toolbox; 6) Find Team; and 7) Involve Audience. Specifically, we discuss how these steps formed a firm foundation for SYRIOS. Emphasis is placed on the interdisciplinary nature of this work, as well as the cyclical and ongoing nature of the work in constantly re-evaluating the research question, the evidence, the tools, and the needs of the audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The arrest of 250 Armenians in April of 1915 was the start of a massacre. That massacre helped inform the creation of a new word, genocide, in 1944.

		<Abstract>This paper provided first a brief introduction to textual history and distinguishes it from textual criticism.  It then proceeds to a description of the assumptions of the field and the foundations for doing this work to be found in the Law of Statistical Regularity, the importance of careful construction of samples for study (both the chronological distribution of the sample manuscripts as well as the size and distribution of the sample). We then describe the methods for creating accurate transcriptions, and preparing the transcriptions for machine readability, converting the textual relations into numbers, generating statistical profiles, and querying the database of statistics to identify shared text variations within the manuscript clusters. At this point we describe the three major epochs in the textual history of the Ethiopic Old Testament, and demonstrate the types of reports that we can generate that illuminate the textual history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At this panel, we ask just how "free" is free speech? How do we protect space for dissent? From "gag rules" prohibiting abolitionist views on the congressional floor to anarchists and communists being deported or imprisoned for sedition; and from obscenity laws to women's right to birth control, Americans have often pushed the boundaries of politically acceptable speech, and faced robust resistance.  At this event historians Brett Gadsden, Barbara Krauthamer, Claire Potter, and Geoffrey R. Stone discuss catalytic moments where strident expressions of political thought, widely perceived to be anti-democratic in their own place and time, provoked new strictures</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How has the First Amendment been invoked to help or to hinder the progress of civil rights? This discussion will examine how the mid-1960s were a turning point not only for the Civil Rights movement, but also the history of free speech in the U.S. From the Civil Rights Act to landmark Supreme Court decisions, the boundaries of the First Amendment were tested in ways that affected civil rights in the decades following.  DeJuana Thompson, President &amp;amp; CEO of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, along with panelists Carlos A. Ball, Michael Harriot, and Dr. Tara Y. White will dig into the rich legacy of civil rights and advocacy that has propelled social change in Birmingham and beyond. Ashley M. Jones, Poet Laureate for the state of Alabama, will open the panel at the Birmingham Museum of Art with a reading of her own work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Censorship and book bans are nothing new in American life. In the 19th century, it was the federal Comstock laws barring the delivery and distribution of "every obscene, lewd, or lascivious" book. Today, books that highlight race, gender, or sexuality are being yanked from public shelves around the country. Join PEN America and the New York Public Library for a conversation about the history of book banning and obscenity laws on Wednesday, September 21 at the Stephen A. Schwarzman building. Ali Velshi will moderate a panel with author Laurie Halse Anderson, and scholars Farah Jasmine Griffin, Whitney Strub, and Amy Werbel. Actor André de Shields, the star of the upcoming revival of Death of a Salesman, will open the evening reading a passage from Toni Morrison.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Based on the experience of members of the THEOT team working with the Andre Tweed collection of Ethiopian manuscripts (ca. 220 items) at Howard University, this two-hour zoom consultation provided the team at Duke University with information they could use to prioritize the work they will do on their own collection of about 110 Ethiopian manuscripts in their collection.  We provided an explanation of: 1) The Benefits to Throwing Your Lot in with a Virtual Manuscript Environment; 2) the best forms in which metadata will serve the needs of digital humanists in the study of textual history and manuscript studies; 3) the workflow necessary to ensure the accurate labeling and organization of image sets of manuscripts so that the images can be made available in the IIIF protocols; and 4) the options that the Duke Team has in deciding about the extent of the work they could do in each area.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>War creates chaos seen and unseen. During WWI, the Ottoman Empire suffered from casualties and contagions as conditions were optimal for the spread of disease. Sometimes borne among the fighting men, it soon found victims among civilians caught in war zones. Dr. Yücel Yanikdag, professor at the University of Richmond, examines the spread of several diseases that further devastated the Ottoman Empire beyond the battlefield. Whether 100 years ago or today, war creates conditions for the destructive spread of infection and disease. While the "long war" ended in 1922, its demographic and disease-related consequences continued for decades. This event, part of The World War I in the Middle East Summer Institute for K-12 Educators, has been made possible in part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  [Note - this will also be uploaded to the National WWI Museum and Memorial's YouTube channel in 2023]</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent anti-Asian hate and resulting activism, in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement, have reignited the possibilities of interracial solidarity. This crucial coalition-building can best be understood through its historical antecedents: the social protest movements of the 1960s and 70s and the call for ethnic studies curricula in the American education system. Emblematic of this call for Asian Americans was a literary anthology, Aiiieeeee! (1974), which insisted on an Asian American voice that went far beyond the stereotypical cry of Asian characters depicted in early American films and comic books that inspired its title.   This webinar will be led by Professor Tara Fickle, who helped to get the anthology reissued in 2019, wrote the new foreword, and is developing an associated digital archive. It will provide educators with grounding to teach Asian American literature, contextualizing major events and themes (such as Japanese American mass incarceration, the racial "in-between" position of Asian Americans as model minorities, and the rise of China) that have informed this underappreciated body of literature. Educators will learn to effectively lead students in discussions of a complex racial history, deploy accurate and up-to-date vocabulary, and connect contemporary events on the domestic and international stage to their history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Housekeeping plays a crucial role in the successful management and care of archival, library, and museum collections. Informed and regularly-scheduled cleaning and other housekeeping tasks significantly benefit both the health and safety of collections materials and the infrastructure that supports them. In addition, a well-rounded housekeeping program can support other essential functions of an organization, such as security, pest management, and building maintenance.  This session will examine best practices for dusting and vacuuming collections objects. Discussion includes tips for drafting these tasks in a housekeeping plan, what to consider when purchasing supplies and equipment, and steps your site can implement to generally reduce dirt and dust from entering collections spaces.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper addresses the persistence of the Otherworld in ancient literature and modern folklore, as well as graphic and digital media. In Ireland and elsewhere believers continue to encounter the aos síthe (folk of the Otherworld) and similar "small gods" and to exploit them for both tourism and religion. These small gods, by way of Wales, also became French fairies (Fée); while the faeries of post-Norman England eventually became a lucrative modern business in fantasy literature, garden decor, and other popular media. I examine this co-evolution of story and Otherworld over the long haul, asking: Why do some forms of the supernatural and their veneration survive major religious shifts while others disappear?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk presents the experiences of India's Dalit Christians (formerly called "untouchables") as a valuable window for examining larger patterns of Global Christianities. As products of mass conversion movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Dalit Christians lived at the margins of Hindu village life and established Christian traditions, and their theologies critiqued caste oppression within both Hindu and Christian contexts. More recently, Dalits have found in Pentecostalism an alternative source of identity and belonging built around ecstatic worship, relaxed caste barriers, belief in supernatural healing and prophecy, and pastoral services that address the needs of mobile, poor, sick, and marginal peoples. I argue that Pentecostalism, like Dalit theology, de-centers India's "ideal citizen subject" - the upper caste, educated Hindu whose claim to cultural hegemony is grounded in a pure, classical heritage. It does so by presenting an alternative "affective citizenship" that nurtures a sense of belonging through democratic practices and tangible experiences of community and spirituality. The recent surge in Hindu nationalist violence against Pentecostals reacts to this de-centering work and the appeal of Pentecostalism among the marginal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the interrelationships between Syrian immigration, the textile industry, and smuggling in the US-Mexico borderlands between 1900 and 1934. Syrian immigration to Mexico increased significantly during this period, driven by the expansion of the Syrian diaspora's textile industry and by tightening immigration restrictions across the hemisphere. Tracking one network of Syrian lace merchants also suspected of migrant smuggling, the paper lays out how "unmentionable" circuits of labor produced the laces peddlers carried as well as the illegal Syrian immigrant.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From launching world premieres to negotiating distribution deals, major international film festivals like Toronto, Cannes, and Venice play a vital role in the global marketplace. With the emergence of the #metoo and Time's Up movements, these annual events are under increased scrutiny for contributing to widespread gender inequities within a historically male-dominated industry. This presentation explores the powerful role of festivals as industry gatekeepers through a feminist media industry studies lens. First, I briefly outline common barriers women face in applying to and participating in major North American and European festivals. From historical disparities in acceptance rates for female-driven films to the lack of diversity in attending critics, women filmmakers do not gain access to the same career opportunities and advantages as male peers. Second, although more festivals are committing to gender parity pledges like 5050x2020, how individual festivals address gender inequity still varies widely. I examine two case studies—Cannes and Toronto—and the industrial, cultural, and economic factors impacting how each festival approaches this systemic issue. Even as the Cannes film market witnessed increased sales and distribution deals for female-driven projects, programming for official screenings remains male-dominated. In contrast, Toronto has emerged as an industry leader in equity and inclusion initiatives through female-driven programming, conference panels, and initiatives like Share Her Journey. Based on industry interviews, festival participant observation, and trade press coverage between 2013 and 2018, this presentation offers an on-the-ground look at the developing impact of #metoo and Time's Up on the international film festival business.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this talk I will give an account of a recent NEH-funded project to make multispectral images of a world map made by Henricus Martellus in about 1491, which is held by the Beinecke Library at Yale. This large map has long been thought to be one of the most important of the fifteenth century, and was thought to have influenced Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507, but the many texts on the map were illegible due to fading and damage, and thus its exact place in Renaissance cartography was impossible to determine. The new multispectral images have rendered many of the previously illegible texts on the map legible. I will explain why the Martellus map was an excellent candidate for multispectral imaging, describe the process of making the images, show some of the results, and give an account of the place of the Martellus map in late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century cartography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examined the clash of cultures between the court poets of archbishop Manasses I of Reims (c. 1069-1080) and the reform party in the cathedral chapter, using the texts produced by both parties in the course of their conflict. It demonstrates an important "culture war" between reformed and unreformed ideas of clerical life and patronage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>WAM will convene the Second National Symposium on Habitability of Environments in 2020. In preparation for the symposium, a cohort of collaborators from the arts, commercial space exploration, architecture, space medicine, anthropology and art history will gather in Minneapolis this October to consider the question: What fields of knowledge and ways of knowing are necessary to address the notion of a habitability beyond ‘life support'?   Please join us for a public conversation following the workshop, that will include an overview of the Habitability Project by WAM curator Boris Oicherman, followed by a screening of samples of Tektite Revisited: Meghan O'Hara and James Merle Thomas' in-progress documentary about NASA's underwater habitability research in the U.S. Virgin Islands between 1969-70, and a presentation about the commercial space platform Axiom Space by Christian Maender. The event will culminate with a roundtable discussion involving workshop participants.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the shift to online services and programs in the wake of the pandemic, librarians discovered the benefits of online programming such as reaching new audiences. This shift also came with some drawbacks, including bridging the issues of digital equity for patrons without always having the resources at hand. Now, as the country starts to move back to offering more in-person gatherings and services, librarians are left to determine how to balance the shifting priorities and levels of comfort of their patrons while maintaining robust program offerings. In this first webinar of a series on hybrid programming, moderator Laura Saunders will explore the impact of COVID-19 on library programming, provide an overview of hybrid programming, and discuss the potential benefits of hybrid programming as a way to maintain service to remote audiences while re-introducing the in-person audience. The webinar is planned to be discussion-based with substantial time for participants to ask questions and share experiences. The webinar will also provide a brief introduction to the rest of the series.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Document your Story: COVID-19 Pandemic Project Archive brought together three community organizations to collect and preserve material created during COVID-19 from many different perspectives. This project has collected material from a variety of community members, such as local artists, diarists, the local business community, Muncie citizens, and Ball State University students, faculty and staff.  While this project started as a way to encourage people in Muncie and Delaware County, Ind., to tell their stories during this time, it has developed into a mechanism for continued collaboration within our community.  In this session, we will discuss the collaboration process, the steps taken to collect material and future plans to create a digital community archive.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In keeping with the theme of transgression for the 2023 Terasaki Center Graduate Student Conference, this presentation introduces the continuum of immigration and imperialism in prewar Japanese expansionist discourse, particularly from the perspective of modern literature. Although it is often taken for granted that settler colonialism in the Empire of Japan and Japanese mass migration to the Americas represent distinctive historical trajectories and must be studied in isolation from one another according to different academic disciplines and methodologies, this presentation will attempt to complicate tidy narratives of national, immigrant, and imperial belonging. By focusing upon literary works that were largely serialized in prewar Japanese-language immigrant newspapers published in Brazil and pro-expansionist magazines from Japan proper, I seek to disclose the surprisingly intimate and intersectional discourse regarding what it meant to be Japanese in the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Artists in Roman Italy created exquisite landscapes that reflect close ties with their environment, ranging from sunny seascapes and tranquil country shrines to vividly imagined views of Greece and Egypt. The San Antonio Museum of Art's spring exhibition, "Roman Landscapes: Visions of Nature and Myth from Rome and Pompeii," explores this inventive genre of Roman art through a selection of wall paintings, sculptures and luxury objects, many never before shown in the United States. In this lecture curator Jessica Powers offers a behind-the-scenes look at the exhibition, which will be on view from February 24-May 21, 2023.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture will discuss the many roles that trees played in shaping Roman culture and perceptions of the environment, from domestic decoration to religious divination. Since the early practice of augury, trees played a key role in defining sacred terrain. Late verbal and visual images attest how trees marked sites of worship, preserved historical memory, and resolved legal disputes. A gnarled oak forms a nodal point for travelers and pilgrims; regimented rows of trees demarcate private boundaries and promise fertility of crops; orchards protect and enliven tombs. Roman modes of viewing trees capture a dynamic reciprocity between arboreal and human life. This lecture is part of the 2023 Lennox Seminar Lecture Series and is made possible by the Martha, David, and Bagby Lennox Foundation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Uncovering the Past: How Trans History Was Made." How do the stories of marginalized communities become history? It used to be the case that only the powerful decided what counted as history. But this is no longer true. In this presentation, Dr. Elizabeth Collins interviews Dr. Catherine Jacquet who recounts how professional historians began to record the stories of trans individuals and organizations. The story begins with the trans activists themselves who not only stood up for their rights, but also made record of their struggles and accomplishments. Join Zoom to learn about how the process of recording history has become more inclusive and expansive as you learn about the lives of activists who changed history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Change Together: A symposium with Faculty and Students  Oct 18, 12:30-2:00 pm in the Cafeteria- B Buidling  This event is for students, faculty, campus staff, and is open to the public.  Text: This event brings students and faculty together to share information and insights about building better classrooms and improving the college experience on campus for EVERY student! We are celebrating the culmination of the National Endowment for the Humanities grant where select faculty built new courses which offer Human Diversity credit for students. The new courses are intended to give students more course choices where the topics discussed include global perspectives,  Latinx, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ voices, as well as inclusive classroom practices. But faculty can't make changes alone. We want to hear from Trtiton students about the educational changes they envision will make their education more personally meaningful and relevant to their lives!  The Change Together symposium will open with Comments from the project director, Dr. Elizabeth Collins. We will look at some student survey responses and then faculty members will each take the floor to talk about how they have made changes in their classrooms to empower students.  Professor Gail Krahenbuhl (English): The Anti-Racist Classroom Professor Lisa Samra (Speech and Theater): Maximizing Student Choice in a Collaborative Classroom Professor Maxi Armas (Spanish/ Humanities): Why Triton needs Latinx and Latin American Studies Dr. Christina Brophy (History/ Humanities): Centering Marginalized Voices in the Classroom   And while we are all together, students will have a chance to discuss together the ideas they have about how classroom can become places where they are seen, heard, respected, and offered an education that serves their higher goals! The faculty intend to take your ideas and share them to help build a better classroom and campus experience for everyone.  Please join us and add your voice and your vision to this impo</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What was the nature of the American union during the nation's adolescence, after the Founding and before the Civil War?  The Interbellum Constitution was a set of widely shared legal and political principles: commerce, concurrent power, and jurisdictional multiplicity, all grouped under the heading of "commercial union."  These issues concerned what we might now term "federalism," insofar as they frame the relationships among multiple levels of government with varying degrees of autonomy.  A core claim of this book, however, is that there existed many more federalisms, plural, in the early nineteenth century than today's constitutional debates admit.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Paper is a technology. And paper technology has endured from Renaissance Europe through the 2020 pandemic spring as a platform for making, holding and disseminating knowledge. Now we find ourselves in a moment of transition in which personal meetings are replaced by Zoom and paper gives way to PDFs. So are technologies of paper and the digital terminally incompatible? Applying a polymathic approach demonstrates quite the opposite, rather that the two technologies intertwined can produce knowledge heretofore unseen.    Scalar Creative Director Erik Loyer and Professor of Art History Lisa Pon join our polymathic community to explicate the ways and spaces where text and the digital intersect right here at USC.  With the Remastering the Renaissance Project, for instance, the USC Libraries' special collections, the School of Cinematic Arts, the Classics and Art History Departments, and the Ahmanson Lab form just one of several polymathic collaborative ensembles where the application of virtual technologies illuminates ancient texts to speak and disseminate new and profound forms of knowledge.  Scalar, a platform for media-rich scholarly publishing, facilitates similar functions and is a tool that all of our polymaths can learn and apply to their own scholarship—in any and all disciplines across the university.  We are limited only by our imagination with the discoveries to be made by the intersection of technologies of the past (ie: paper) with the emerging technologies of today and the future (Multimedia, VR, AR, GIS, AI to name a few). And polymaths are, indeed, of the imaginative sort.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Sicilian Channel between Sicily and North Africa receives global attention as a major migratory route for undocumented people entering Europe clandestinely, a tragic nexus of transnational displacement and desperation. While the plight of massively overloaded and unseaworthy boats of people justifiably receives the bulk of media attention, there is a less-observed movement that occurs and has occurred for thousands of years: small boats expertly transporting handfuls of people back and forth across the Channel between Tunisia and western Sicily. This study explores the material vestiges of cross-channel migrations through assemblages identified during fieldwork by the Arizona Sicily Project along the southwest coast of Sicily in the summers of 2018 and 2019. While the exigencies of maritime crossing require distinct technologies of mobility, certain elements of migrant material culture are analogous to that found elsewhere, e.g. along the US–Mexico border zone of Arizona's Sonoran Desert. Such elements include migrants' strategic triangulation of speed, invisibility and survival in deciding what to bring and the tactical triage of gear en route. Moreover, the political and economic injustices that are catalysts for the movements are comparable, as is the criminalization of the migrants, which has done more to endanger than dissuade them. This article sheds new light on migrant choices and challenges and contributes to the archaeology of contemporary migration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture traced the trajectory of Frank Tannenbaum from his days as a "notorious" Wobbly militant to his later years as an Ivy-League academic and Cold War liberal.  I argue that despite his shift to the right politically, he remained a highly unconventional intellectual and his work continued to reflect the influence both of his personal experiences as a young radical, and his engagement with certain anarchist thinkers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Violence, greed, great hope. There were the lives and the dreams of Kentucky's earliest white settlers. Lynnell Edwards will read from and discuss her research for her newest collection of poetry, This Great Green Valley. Drawing on archival documents from the Filson collections related to both her early ancestors in Kentucky, the McAfees, as well as better-known pioneers such as Daniel Boone, Benjamin Logan, Simon Kenton, and Richard Henderson, Edwards re-imagines these founding stories through dramatic poetry that weaves together the pastoral and the historical to bring light and life from across the centuries.    Lynnell Edwards' most recent collection of poetry is?This Great Green Valley?(Broadstone Books, 2020), a book of documentary poetry based on revisionist narratives of Kentucky's pioneer founding in the 18th century. She is the author of three additional full-length poetry collections and a?chapbook,?Kings of the Rock and Roll Hot Shop, which chronicles the work and art of a glass-blowing studio.?Her work often investigates the deep connections between a people and their place, including the natural, political, and family narratives in its history. She is the Associate Programs Director for the Spalding University MFA in creative writing where she teaches and lectures in poetry.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>James Ogilvie is the most important early American celebrity you've never heard of. As a performer and public speaker, he wowed American audiences with his grace and eloquence, allowing him to travel to virtually every corner of the United States before 1820. And yet after his death, he was forgotten. This talk examines the period he spent in Kentucky, giving lectures and serving with the Kentucky militia during the War of 1812. Based on her new book, The Strange Genius of Mr. O: The World of the United States' First Forgotten Celebrity (2021), the author speaks about how collections at the Filson and other Kentucky archives allowed her to flesh out this remarkable story.   Carolyn Eastman is a professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University. Her research focuses on the cultural and intellectual history of early America and the Atlantic world, political culture, gender, and the history of print, oral, and visual media. She is the author of the prizewinning A Nation of Speechifiers: Making an American Public after the Revolution (Chicago, 2009), and is currently a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the New-York Historical Society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Most Americans today would not think of their local church as a site for arbitration and would probably be hesitant to bring their property disputes, moral failings, or personal squabbles to their kin and neighbors for judgment. But from the Revolutionary Era through the mid-nineteenth century, many Protestants imbued local churches with immense authority. Through their ritual practice of discipline, churches insisted that brethren refrain from suing each other before "infidels" at local courts and claimed jurisdiction over a range of disputes: not only moral issues such as swearing, drunkenness, and adultery but also matters more typically considered to be under the purview of common law and courts of equity, including disputes over trespass, land, probate, slave warranty, and theft.    In?Law in American Meetinghouses, Jeffrey Thomas Perry explores the ways that ordinary Americans—Black and white, enslaved and free—understood and created law in their local communities, uncovering a vibrant marketplace of authority in which church meetinghouses played a central role in maintaining their neighborhoods' social peace. Churches were once prominent sites for the creation of local law and in this period were a primary arena in which civil and religious authority collided and shaped one another. When church discipline failed, the wronged parties often pushed back, and their responses highlight the various forces that ultimately hindered that venue's ability to effectively arbitrate disputes between members. Relying primarily on a deep reading of church records and civil case files, Perry examines how legal transformations, an expanding market economy, and religious controversy led churchgoers to reimagine their congregations' authority. By the 1830s, unable to resolve doctrinal quibbles within the fellowship, church factions turned to state courts to secure control over their meetinghouses, often demanding that judges wade into messy ecclesiastical disputes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As the imperial ideology of Ottomanism and modern discourses of citizenship spread, so did the understanding of laziness as a social disease that the 'Ottoman nation' needed to eradicate. Inventing Laziness asks what we can learn about Ottoman history over the long nineteenth-century by looking closely into the contested and shifting boundaries of the laziness - productivity binary. Hafez explores how 'laziness' can be used to understand emerging civic culture and its exclusionary practices in the Ottoman Empire.  A polyphonic involvement of moralists, intellectuals, polemicists, novelists, bureaucrats, and, to an extent, the public reveals the complexities and ambiguities of this multifaceted cultural transformation. Using a wide variety of sources, Hafez's book explores the sustained anxiety about productivity that generated numerous reforms as well as new understandings of morality, subjectivity, citizenship, and nationhood among the Ottomans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Among the treasures in the monastery of Studenica in Serbia is a large silk hanging, woven for the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389-1402). It is the earliest known Ottoman textile and is among the earliest works of Ottoman art of any sort. Although it is very well reserved, its initial production remains mysterious, as do its trajectories in the fifteenth century and later. This talk combines an overview of the silk's historical context with a discussion of technology and material and makes a brief foray into its later life in Studenica and elsewhere.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Sharpe offers a cultural history of Anatolian Rock, a genre of popular music combining Turkish folk music with European and North American rock 'n' roll. In the 1960s and 1970s, musicians like Cem Karaca and Selda Bagcan brought together traditional lyrics and melodies from the Anatolian countryside with modern instruments like electric guitars, bass, drum kit, and synthesizers. The presentation situates the music within the history of 1960s social movements in Turkey and the global youth countercultures of the period. It discusses the historical and social dynamics linking Anatolia to the cities and peasants to students, the influence of rural musical traditions on youth culture, the influence of the official ideology of peasantism in the creation of Anatolian Rock, and cold war-era dynamics of American cultural influence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk focuses on how Ottomans talked about books in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Ottoman Empire was a heavily manuscript-oriented society and the imperial administration left behind an immense paper trial. Yet, while many manuscripts circulated in Ottoman lands since the fourteenth century, access to books was not always easy. Ottoman scholars often learned about books not by reading them but by talking about them. Hearsay allowed for the transmission of knowledge around the material text, usually by reporting on the contents of a book that a scholar did not have access to, but that was somehow relevant to what he was writing. Through the analysis of biographical dictionaries and other literary works of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, I show that there were forms of communication other than written texts that predetermined what was put into writing, and that they might not have existed in opposition to each other, as in the dichotomy between oral and written, but indeed depended on each other. In other words, I will argue that texts and information were expected to occur in the performance of both the written text and oral communication, between the formal register and the informal interaction, and that oral communication had an important impact in how people remembered texts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>First generation college students often face a multitude of academic, social, and economic barriers to success in higher education. This is especially true when these students lack rich relationships with their peers and instructors or confidence in their academic abilities. With the generous support from a National Endowment for the Humanities Access Grant and the Kalamazoo Promise, our team of instructors and peer mentors ran a Bridge Year Program (2018-2021) designed to provide material, academic, and socio-emotional support to a small group of first-generation college students during their first year at Western Michigan University. I will briefly reflect on the successes and failures of this program and also suggest possible ways that institutions of higher education might create supportive, relationship-rich educational experiences for all students. I then hope to facilitate a meaningful conversation with faculty and staff about effective teaching and mentorship that promote first generation college student success.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>MHS Historian's Forum featuring a round table discussion about the Pejepscot Proprietors, one of the largest companies of elite land speculators that played an outsized role in colonizing the lands in what became the State of Maine in 1820. In the early eighteenth century, a handful of wealthy Boston families acquired the deed to a tract of land encompassing much of the state. The original proprietors and their descendants spent the next century luring colonists onto company towns to in order to improve the value of their claim. At the same time, the proprietors struggled to convince Indigenous Wabanakis, rival land companies, and even many of their own colonists to conform to their vision for mid-Maine.  In their quest to amass a fortune from their enterprise, the Pejepscot Proprietors left a rich trove of documents now held in the Maine Historical Society. Historians and other scholars from a wide range of disciplines have since made use of this collection to learn more about not only the proprietors themselves, but also Wabanaki people and colonists from all backgrounds.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For generations, the Ulster Scots were a people on the move. From their home in the Scottish Lowlands, these Presbyterians ventured first to Ulster, and then across the Atlantic, where they carved out lives in Britain's North American colonies, including what became the state of Maine. By the American Revolution, 200,000 Ulster Scots had crossed the sea. In North America, the Ulster Scots had a profound influence in shaping the culture and politics of the British colonies and their borderlands. Their story is one of rich contrasts. This special Historian's Forum features a conversation with two eminent historians of the Ulster Scots experience in Early America. Host Ian Saxine (MHS Coordinator, Historian's Forum) speaks with Patrick Griffin (University of Notre Dame) and T.H. Breen (University of Vermont) about the Ulster Scots migrations, with a particular focus on what brought them to Maine and New England, and what their experiences can tell us about religion, community, war, empire, and globalization in the colonial era. This is part of a program series for the MHS Beyond Borders project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>It was a wrong turn that changed everything. When Luma Mufleh—a Muslim, gay, refugee woman from hyper-conservative Jordan—stumbled upon a pick-up game of soccer in Clarkston, Georgia, something compelled her to join. The players, 11- and 12-year-olds from Liberia, Afghanistan, and Sudan, soon welcomed her as coach of their ragtag but fiercely competitive group. Drawn into their lives, Mufleh learned that few of her players, all local public school students, could read a single word. She asks, "Where was the America that took me in? That protected me? How can I get these kids to that America?"   Learning America traces the story of how Mufleh grew a group of kids into a soccer team and then into a nationally acclaimed network of schools for refugee children.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ann McCutchan‘s The Life She Wished to Live paints a lively portrait of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and the Florida landscape and people that inspired her.  Rawlings was a tough, passionate, and independent woman who refused the early-twentieth-century conventions of her upbringing. Determined to forge a literary career beyond those limitations, she found her voice in the remote hardscrabble life of Cross Creek, Florida. Between hunting alligator and managing an orange grove, Rawlings employed her sensitive eye, sharp ear for dialogue, and philosophical spirit to bring to life an unknown corner of America in vivid, tender detail?a feat that earned her the Pulitzer Prize in 1938.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this "masterpiece of discernment and insight" (The New York Times Book Review), acclaimed biographer Kati Marton sets out to pierce the mystery of Angela Merkel's unlikely ascent. With unparalleled access to the chancellor's inner circle and a trove of records only recently come to light, she uncovers the unique political genius and secret to Merkel's success. No modern leader so ably confronted Russian aggression, enacted daring social policies, and calmly unified an entire continent in an era with countries becoming more divided. Merkel cleverly outmaneuvered strongmen like Putin and Trump and weathered surprisingly complicated relationships with allies like Obama and Macron.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In celebration of Black History Month, Dr. Rebecca Hall, a historian, granddaughter of slaves, and a woman haunted by the legacy of slavery, joined the program to discuss the inspiration and making of her book, Wake. The accepted history of slave revolts tells her that enslaved women took a back seat. But she feels the need to look deeper. Her journey takes her through old court records, slave ship captain's logs, crumbling correspondence, and even the forensic evidence from the bones of enslaved women from the "negro burying ground" uncovered in Manhattan. She finds women warriors everywhere. Using in-depth archival research and the measured use of historical imagination, Dr. Hall brings to life the women who fought for freedom during the Middle Passage and the women who led slave revolts in Colonial New York.</Abstract>

In this session, led by The Mount's Director of Interpretation Anne Schuyler, and Librarian Nynke Dorhout, survey works in Wharton's library devoted to the natural world, from her many gardening books to works on astronomy and science. Wharton's markings give a glimpse of her garden aesthetic as well as the practical concerns of a country gardener.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk investigates the ways in which digitally enhanced tourist performance in the PRC mobilize classicist aesthetics and poetics to connect classical literary topoi to a broader shared sense of Chinese culture among audience members. Since the early 2000s, the popularity of Zhang Yimou's "Impressions Series" has led to the growth of large-scale performances at destinations such as West Lake in Hangzhou, Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province, and Dunhuang in Gansu Province—locations that also feature prominently in classical poetry, Buddhist religious practice, and the Chinese national imaginary. These elaborate shows capitalize on the latest advancements in spectacular performance technologies and engage with the Chinese literary tradition, often literalizing well-known poetic images and literally overlaying the stage with Chinese characters, landscape paintings, and photographic images. Digital technologies transform live performance into a projection surface, yet in doing so also project a form of classicism that seems only skin deep. Building on the theoretical work of media studies scholars Giuliana Bruno, Audrey Yue, and others, this talk will explore the "surface tensions" inherent in these works. It argues that while critiques of the superficiality of large-scale performance remain valid, that very superficiality (as well as its rootedness in digital technologies) is also instrumental in enabling classicism to resonate with broader audiences. Examination of surface classicism in popular performances therefore allows us to reconsider the relationship between classicism and cutting-edge technology, materiality and immateriality, liveness and mediation in the digital age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the heart of Deborah Cohen's new book, Last Call at the Hotel Imperial, is a group of American reporters – John Gunther, H.R. Knickerbocker, Vincent Sheean and Dorothy Thompson -- who in the 1920s and 1930s achieved world-wide renown.  They warned about the rise of fascism and championed anti-colonial leaders.  Diagnosing a drastic transformation of personal life, they chronicled first privately and then more openly, the slippage between their own relationships and world affairs.  They found they could no longer separate themselves from the crises raging around them, and spoke to readers who couldn't either.  In this session, Cohen will map out the shared terrain between international history and the history of private life, discussing the ways in which a potent combination of Freudianism, fascism, and imperialism made the relationship between the individual and the collective an exigent mid-twentieth-century question.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Join acclaimed historians Deborah Cohen and Adam Tooze in a conversation about Last Call at the Hotel Imperial. Hailed by the New Yorker as "effervescent," Cohen's recent book explores a globe-trotting set of interwar American reporters who raised the alarm about the rise of fascism and rewrote the rules of journalism along the way.  Last Call at the Hotel Imperial is the extraordinary story of John Gunther, H. R. Knickerbocker, Vincent Sheean, and Dorothy Thompson. In those tumultuous years, they landed exclusive interviews with Hitler and Mussolini, Nehru and Gandhi, and helped shape what Americans knew about the world. Alongside these backstage glimpses into the halls of power, they left another equally incredible set of records. Living in the heady afterglow of Freud, they subjected themselves to frank, critical scrutiny and argued about love, war, sex, death, and everything in between.  Plunged into successive global crises, Gunther, Knickerbocker, Sheean, and Thompson could no longer separate themselves from the turmoil that surrounded them. To tell that story, they broke long-standing taboos. From their circle came not just the first modern account of illness in Gunther's Death Be Not Proud—a memoir about his son's death from cancer—but the first no-holds-barred chronicle of a marriage: Sheean's Dorothy and Red, about Thompson's fractious relationship with Sinclair Lewis.  Told with the immediacy of a conversation overheard, this revelatory book captures how the global upheavals of the twentieth century felt up close.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Grammatical gender—a system of classifying nouns as masculine, feminine, or neuter—has long been the bane of language learners. That in German "a young lady has no sex, but a turnip has" led Mark Twain to lament "the awful German language." But for 19th-century German linguists, grammatical gender was not capricious or irrational, but rather a deeply meaningful structure that provided insight into cultural norms and primitive forefathers. This session provides an overview of theories of grammatical gender from this period and explores how they centered on a fundamental question: Is it possible to imagine "the human" as unsexed?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In cultural heritage preservation, visual and architectural aspects of heritage sites are emphasized while little attention has been given to sensory and acoustic features. Because human experience is holistic, the contribution of auditory information is significant. In fact, many built environments have been specifically designed and used for conveying particular auditory information. For example, concert halls and recording studios are constructed to create pleasing acoustics for musicians and audiences. In such buildings, acoustics translate to auditory information that can uniquely identify a space. Moreover, visual information is dominant for 'informatic' experiences, while auditory information has been strongly associated with the 'emotional' aspects of those experiences, as well as with communication properties. In convincing and meaningful renderings of virtual experiences, therefore, successful delivery of auditory importation is not supplementary, but essential.</Abstract>

Dr. Baker-Bell will introduce a new way forward through Antiracist Black Language Pedagogy, a pedagogical approach that intentionally and unapologetically places Black Language at the center to critically interrogate white linguistic hegemony and anti-Black linguistic racism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation, delivered at UW-Madison, outlines three chapters of my upcoming book on Feofan Prokopovych. The first chapter argues that Prokopovych was a pioneer in promoting the ideas of Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza, and Galileoin educational curriculum in Kyiv in the early 1700s. It also presents him as a pioneer who introduced such key scientific discoveries as heliocentrism and Toricelli experiments in barometry. The second chapter outlines Prokopovych's legal theory of Empire – his adoption of Hobbes' absolutism, his interpretation of Treuer's organic contract theory and his transplantation of the legal concepts of Holy Roman Empire, particularly the ideas of Reichspublizistik jurists, onto Russian soil.  This chapter argues that Russian Empire was founded as a juridical replica of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Third chapter documents Prokopovych's political theories and court politics that supported the rise of women to Russian imperial thrones. His political maneuvering led to the rise of Catherine I, Empress Anna, Regent Anna and even Empress Elizabeth, making the eighteenth century a century of empresses in Russia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although the European Reformation was an important event in the rise of Western civilization, historians have struggled to define its impact on the peripheries of Europe as well as globally. This seminar presentation will explore the changes within the early imperial East Slavic Orthodoxy (in Muscovy and Ukraine in particular) as an important case for evaluating the Reformation's effect beyond the realms of Protestantism and Catholicism. The presentation presents a thorough analysis of ecclesiastical, ideological and political reforms of Ukrainian archbishop Feofan Prokopovych (1681-1736), extolled by Halle Pietists as Orthodoxy's own "Luther." Such reforms, the presentation will argue, should be viewed not in isolation from but in connection to a much wider European continuum of religious change. Such a context involved, inter alia, the systematization of doctrine, confessionalization, adoption of the principle of harmony between faith and reason, reaction against early modern Catholicism, scriptural vernacularization, sanctification of the work ethic and eventual emergence of an "enlightened" concord of church-state relations, that made the state more sacred and the church more secular. Overall, the study of eighteenth-century reforms should expand the frontiers of the Reformation and the place of Orthodox Church in Europe's early modern religious history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The historic suburban landscapes of Los Angeles are a crucial starting point for understanding suburban life in the region.  They established how communities would look, be built, serviced and regulated, and how open they would be to change. LA's suburban identity originated in the early twentieth century, when city leaders developed a set of ideas and innovative land development practices centered on the suburban ideal. This vision embraced decentralized development as well as racial segregation.  Influenced by a regional eugenics movement, LA leaders pioneered and honed tools of racial exclusion in suburbia.  With this suburban vision in place, distinct built landscapes emerged. Over 130 years, LA's historic suburban landscapes included borderlands, streetcar suburbs, picturesque enclaves and garden suburbs, modest subdivisions before 1940, sitcom suburbs, and edge cities and corporate suburbs.  Each landscape left a legacy for later generations, in the housing stock, the design of communities, and local regulatory cultures.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"I'm an American from the three Americas, more American than (George W.) Bush," quipped Mohamad Barakat at the border where Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina meet. Since the mid-twentieth century, overwhelmingly Muslim Lebanese like Barakat have migrated to this crossroads called the tríplice fronteira in Portuguese, the triple frontera in Spanish, and the tri-border in English. This lecture and seminar will explore the transnational trade and activism of Muslim Lebanese across this borderland. In fulfilling what I call a "manifold destiny," Muslim Lebanese are constitutive of, and constituted by, multiple centers of power in the hemisphere. They animate and endure various "state exceptions," whereby states suspend laws or norms in allegedly "exceptional" circumstances which become part of the status quo. In trading and mobilizing under past authoritarian governments as well as present-day counterterrorist regimes, Muslim Lebanese face a similar fate in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century Americas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Sou americano das três Américas ... mais americano que o próprio George W. Bush", declarou Mohamad Barakat na fronteira onde o Brasil, o Paraguai e a Argentina se encontram. Como Barakat, milhares de libaneses, palestinos e sírios são agentes do que chamaria de um "destino excepcional". O livro que estou terminando, sobre o que eu vou falar agora, examina os árabes frente aos regimes autoritários e contraterroristas. Eu argumento que os árabes tendem a aceitar, em vez de rejeitar, os termos excepcionais de vários governos num tipo de "destino" ou seja, sob circunstâncias não "de sua escolha e sim sob aquelas com as que defrontam diretamente..." como mantém um ditado já bem-divulgado. Desde meados do século XX até hoje, essa acomodação árabe na fronteira revela uma história hemisférica ainda inacabada de ordens excepcionais do nosso passado autoritário e do nosso presente contraterrorista.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent events as diverse as America's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid crisis, the anti-vaccine movement, the debate over the legalization and regulation of marijuana and other personal use drugs, struggles over drug prices and accessibility, among others, all have roots in the history of pharmacy, pharmaceuticals, drugs, medicines, and healthcare. The wide-ranging public debates about these topics vividly demonstrate the vital importance of grounding contemporary public health discussions in a clear understanding of their relevant histories — and in evidence.  This talk, the first part of the Summer 2023 Kreminar series, will showcase ongoing collections activities at the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy and UW-Madison SoP, including NEH and UW funded projects. The talk will also introduce important smaller collections and recent initiatives that will be featured in future episodes of the 2023 Kreminar.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The trajectory of language shift in the West Zapotec region of Oaxaca, Mexico is apparent from the dialect geography: of eleven town centers where Zapotec was spoken, only four remain where some children are raised in Zapotec. Against this backdrop of language shift this talk examines contrasting styles of conversation used in child language socialization in Santa María Lachixío. For many decades Lachixío has been characterized by a functionally differentiated bilingualism in which Zapotec was used in all domains of social life outside of public schooling and public health. In the fourteen years that I have been conducting fieldwork there, a mosaic has developed where some families are now code-shifting to Spanish in their child-directed speech. Using transcribed videotaped data I contrast two families' conversation styles involving same-aged children. I discuss a Zapotec-language speech event in which a family socializes a boy to the Zapotec respect register and contrast videos of another family code-shifting to Spanish when addressing their children. I then turn to analyzing an interaction where these two families intersect and the code-shifting style of socialization became topicalized. Through analysis of the sequence organization of the dialogue I argue that the new socialization style is contested, and discuss several linguistic and interactional devices for constructing irony and "off-record" disagreement. Moving beyond the transcripts, I draw on my ethnographic work to argue that the positions taken up by the participants of this dialogue voice prior conversations between parents and school teachers who suggested that parents stop using Zapotec. Previously, parents organized a unified resistance that partly explains Lachixío's language enduring to the present day. The new socialization style exemplified through the multimodal data presented in this talk represents a contemporary social change being enacted (and contested) through talk in interaction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation was delivered for the students and faculty of the Indo-American PhD program in Linguistic Anthropology.  All the students in this program are native speakers of indigenous languages of Mexico.  The talk focused on repetition across speakers in three Meso-American languages for which the Zapotec data analysis was supported by NEH grant FN-50065-10.  I presented examples drawn from collections of repetition in different sequential locations in conversation in Yucatec and Tzeltal Mayan and Lachixío Zapotec, with the following questions in focus: What kinds of action are performed by repetition in these three languages, and what evidence enables us to identify these action types? What sustains this repeat practice, and makes sense of it in the Mesoamerican context?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The sound qualities of a speaker's voice animate speech and shape social interactions.  Yet, studies of sound quality have not been well developed in anthropology and linguistics.  This is in part because the voice is generally thought to be biologically given, directly related to things like body size or sex of the speaker.  This talk presents research that considers qualities of human voices as cultural constructions and contextualizes the study of voice qualities within social theory.  I present functions of voice qualities from social interactions between speakers of Lachixío Zapotec, an Otomanguean language spoken in the southern mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico.  The interactions demonstrate the use of high pitched and falsetto voices, which I argue index a respect register that presupposes social categories present to a speech event: ritual kin relationships; age grades; and distinguishing among territorial roles like visitor vs. visited.  These multiple person categories show that respect in Lachixío is not binary but hierarchical.  Some uses of high pitch are merely polite, while others are part of a formal honorific system tied to kinship roles.  Where the speech scene involves multiple addressees representing different levels of the social hierarchy, speakers can show varying degrees of respect such that where high pitch displays respect, higher pitch shows more respect, and falsetto voice is the most respectful.  Pitch is varied with addressee choice and such pitch variation uses the voice to create a publicly available diagram of the unequal social relations present to a speech situation.  In the last section of the talk I investigate the question of how children are socialized to this complex system for voicing social relations in Lachixío and point to potentials for further research on voice qualities in linguistic anthropology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Choi will trace the genealogy of modern womanhood in the encounters between Koreans and American Protestant missionaries in colonial Korea (1910-1945). She will show that what it meant to be a "modern" Korean woman was deeply bound up in such diverse themes as Korean nationalism, Confucian gender practices, images of the West and Christianity, and growing desires for selfhood.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk explores community Buddhist temples in rural Japan, a seldom discussed and inadequately researched facet of daily life within smaller Japanese communities.  While famous pilgrimage sites like the Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto represent the iconic image of Japanese Buddhism, locally operating community temples represent the typical religious encounter for the majority of Japanese.  This lecture will provide a close analysis of the structural, interpersonal, and functional dynamics of community temples in small rural Japanese communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cross-cultural exchange between India and China during the medieval times is often understood through a Buddhist lens; by investigating the impact of Indian Buddhist sources to receiving Chinese communities. In these cultural transactions, instigated by traveling pilgrim-monks and enacted by imperial power players in China, India emerges as a remote, idealized, and perhaps "hollow" center.  What seems to be missing in this unidirectional looking is the impact of these cultural communications in India.  What were the Indian responses to Chinese Buddhists' demands and their physical presence?  How was China imagined and translated in medieval India? By examining a group of "China"-inspired Indian Buddhist images and iconographies in the larger geo-political context, this paper charts Indian responses to Chinese and Tibetan demands in their artistic outputs and highlights the complex, multidirectional process of "Other-ing" in medieval global cultural exchange.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Modern art markets and their artistic, cultural, and historical mechanisms have become an important field of study. Although individual art dealers and collectors, as well as specific works of art, have been the subjects of monographic publications and exhibitions, the wider German art trade during the first half of the 20th century has not yet been fully explored. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; At present information on public auctions is scattered among numerous disparate archives and libraries, catalogs are often not even inventoried. There is an urgent need among museum professionals, scholars, and archivists for a universally-accessible database that includes information on all known auctions of the period. The German Sales project was developed to address this need. Although in its initial phase the project focuses on German-speaking countries in the 1930s and 1940s only, its scope will eventually widen to include other countries and decades. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Getty Research Institute, in partnership with the Kunstbibliothek – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin and the Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg is currently working on locating auction catalogs that record art transactions in Germany, Austria and Switzerland between 1930 and 1945, documenting and digitizing thousands of catalogs, and producing a database of these records that will form part of the Getty Provenance Index®.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Gladney's talk examined how China and its 21 million Muslims will be affected by developments in the "Arab Spring" countries.  Gladney addressed China's important and changing relationship with the Middle East, especially with regard to the tumultuous events there following several uprisings and revolutions across North Africa and the Middle East. Among the topics explored are the relevant influence of global social media and Western scholarship, as well as the significance of the October 29 "suicide crash" of a jeep driven by a Uyghur in Tiananmen Square.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Marching proudly into an era of globalization, market economy, and consumer culture, China no longer looks very revolutionary. We must rethink the grand narrative of modern Chinese history.  How can we understand revolution in a new narrative that sees more than just failure in the pre-revolutionary past, and more than just the rejection of revolution in the post-Mao present? Esherick's lecture focused on the narrative of revolution in modern Chinese history after China march proudly into an era of globalization, market economy, and consumer culture.</Abstract>

In this first seminar, the Pacific Northwest Columbia Plateau spirituality is the primary focus; however, songs of meditation in the Indian sub-continent are brought into a comparative space as the musical expertise of the speaker engages the audience, exploring what is meant by spiritual reflection and practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This second lecture in the "Somos Indios" series references the Mayan Calendar as the center of a global paradigm shift through which gender roles are reconsidered and challenged. Gender roles, which are socially and culturally constructed denote personal power, status, attributes and the extent to which contribution is defined and acknowledged within specific communities. Stories from several North American Indian groups are used as examples of gender reassigning or the altering of gender personas to ensure survival  or to enhance the community experience. The Pueblo People's story of "Laughing Warrior Girl" who went from grinding corn to engaging the enemy on horseback is one example given.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through an analysis of the portrayal of Mexican/indigenous women in three key films, the dichotomy of the Virgin de Guadalupe/La Malinche is brought forth as a two-dimensional construct which features impossible models of "womanhood."  Stereotypes of indigenous women are presented as part of a hierarchical structure which includes sophisticated city-types, innocent and unspoiled rural women, and then indigenous women as the lowest category--uneducated,easily duped, and powerless. However it is important to remember that the first film discussed,"Maria Candelaria," does create a new subjectivity in Mexican film: the appearance of the indigenous woman, who although stereo typically represented, is at least visible.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Working with communities and their respective cultural collections housed in libraries, museums, and archives in local, regional, national and global locations is an ethical commitment. Converting materials for online access moves beyond the common term of "digitization." Digital repatriation is political, social, cultural and very complex as issues of loss due to colonization and reassignment of artifacts for national preservation are considered and challenged.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>More than 17 countries were represented by Essex County College's most recent graduating class. Over 25% of those who are Hispanic/Latino make up this diverse population. In conjunction with Liberal Arts Month, Hispanic Heritage Celebration and Humanities Week (Oct. 6-10), the Humanities Department is hosting a free event Bridging Historias: Infusing Latino/Latina Culture into the College Curriculum on Thursday, October 9, from 11:30 a.m. to 12:50 p.m. at the school's main Newark campus. The event, which is open to the public, will take place in the Harry J. Smith Lecture Hall, Room 2131. Guest speaker will be José E. Velázquez, co-editor of The Puerto Rican Movement: Voices from the Diaspora.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Bridging Historias is also the name of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant-funded program in which Dr. Stephanie Aisha Steplight Johnson, Acting Vice President &amp;amp; Chief Academic Officer, along with three faculty members, Professor and Director of Paralegal Studies Linda Carter, Adjunct English Faculty member Maria Luna, and Assistant Professor of Sociology Charles Pinderhughes are participating. These faculty members will present during the event about how they are revamping their courses so that Latino/Latina content is taught and learned by Essex County College students.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This public lecture will demonstrate that roughly 150 years after Sicily's eleventh-century conquest by the Romance-speaking Normans, the island's native Greek-speaking population had largely ceased to write in Greek. Priests of Greek-rite churches, certain notaries, and certain judges, however, continued to "perform" their Greek heritage for the late thirteenth and fourteenth-century Sicilian population, whether by redacting documents in Greek, signing their name in Greek, or even employing another individual to subscribe their name in Greek. This presentation will explore the respective motivations of these populations for drawing attention to their Greek heritage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rajput painting, Hindi poetry and Hindustani music have documented histories going back at least to the sixteenth century. Yet all three aesthetic traditions came under sustained attack in the colonial modern period for their supposed formalism, decadence, hidebound obeisance to tradition, and above all their eroticism and sensuality. Producers and supporters of all three art forms employed surprisingly similar transformative strategies to meet the challenges that modernity and bourgeois nationalism posed to the survival of these important North Indian traditions. In the process, however, important early-modern links among the three traditions, which followed from a rich and virtuosic aesthetic of intermedial and multilingual borrowing, were covered over and largely forgotten. In this conversation, three international scholars of these traditions, whose work traverses the early-modern and colonial periods, will discuss what happened to the entangled histories and aesthetics of these arts as they transitioned into the modern world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What do today's art historians do with India's pre-modern court paintings and why? Do our modern ways of looking bear any relationship to the ways that pre-modern connoisseurs looked at paintings? With the aim of introducing the audience to the ways that Mughal-era viewers appreciated court paintings, this talk considers the relationship of painting to Mughal material culture, to literature and music, and to contemporaneous aesthetic philosophies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the codification in paintings of ideal Indic heroines called nayikas, some of whom were based on earlier sculptural prototypes.  Defined in the visual arts by their conventional poses and motifs, these nayikas entered into a wide range of pictorial contexts, including illustrations of poetic and devotional texts and the pages of Mughal albums, called muraqqa, which combined painting with beautifully calligraphed texts. The Indic nayika joined European, Persian, and Mughal female ideals in a richly varied repertoire of types, which painters would continue to draw on well into the 19th and 20th centuries. Related to this phenomenon was a growing profusion of portraits that pictured elite Mughal and Rajput men with beautiful women, some of them types and some possibly representing wives or mistresses. Focusing on the Indic nayika, this paper examines her aesthetic and social significance in the early years of her codification, especially in relation to the broader proliferation of pictures of female beauties. Particular attention is given to the production and reception of nayika imagery in domains of elite social pleasure, where she would have been surrounded with poetry, music, dance, food and drink, friendship, and love. The paper builds on recent scholarship that understands the Mughal and Rajput worlds to have been mutually constitutive, and on a growing dialogue between South Asian art history and cultural studies, while addressing the need for more sustained theorization of the central place of gender in the visual arts of the Mughal era.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture discusses the high-profile sales of Hopi and Zuni masks in Paris auction houses in 2013. Such auctions were criticized in the international press, for the sales were of sacred masks. Yet, according to some experts, it is likely that some of the masks were modern replicas. Issues of inter-cultural ethics, replication and repatriation will be covered, with reference made to several Native American groups.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Addams's conception of peace grew out of her immersion in the industrial, immigrant neighborhood of Chicago's nineteenth ward, and her concrete efforts to bring about understanding among immigrants from many nationalities. Her many forms of activism during World War One grew out of her conviction that war can never bring democracy. Violence only hardens hatred and divisions among people, rather than healing them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a thoroughly connected culture where media are ubiquitous, even inescapable, what does it mean when individuals consciously turn away from media technologies? What do we accomplish, or what do we imagine we might accomplish, by unplugging, deactivating, and tuning out? In this presentation, Portwood-Stacer will share her research on the conscious disavowal of media engagement, a phenomenon she has termed "media refusal." Focusing especially on social network platforms, Portwood-Stacer argues that lifestyle practices involving refusal accrue meaning through their situation in contexts where participation is the norm. Her presentation will discuss various dimensions of media refusal discourses, including the political, economic, ethical, and gendered aspects of disconnection, and how they function in our overall understanding of the relationship between digital technologies, identity, and society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2014 Video game culture was rocked by a major scandal--Gamergate--that highlighted its problems with sexism and racism. Women and players of color must negotiate intense and sometimes-painful attachments to a dream of equality and respect earned through "good play" both within and without games.  This paper will analyze social justice strategies for addressing racism and sexism within gaming culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper attempts to interpret digital data related to film editing that have been submitted to the online application called Cinemetrics (see http://www.cinemetrics.lv/index.php) by a large group of scholars and students in the time period 2005-2011. The interpretation proceeds from 2 premises, asks one question and proposes three hypotheses.&amp;#x0D; PREMISE 1. It is an established fact that, at certain points, each given film is cut faster or slower than its average shot length (ASL) figure indicates.&amp;#x0D; PREMISE 2. There is little doubt that these are not random fluctuations. That the film's cutting becomes faster at one point or slower at another must be caused by certain factors.&amp;#x0D; QUESTION: What are these factors?&amp;#x0D; HYPOTHESES: there are 3 kinds of factors at work: 1) Event-driven (ED) factors. 2) Story-flow (SF) related factors. 3) Conventional editing (CE) related factors.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Addams, a committed pacifist, was active in soliciting humanitarian aid for those made hungry by war. Her own speeches and writing on behalf of humanitarian aid were all cast in terms of meeting people's most basic needs and creating connections of sympathy and understanding between donors and recipients. Yet she worked closely with people who saw relief as a weapon of war and as a tool for staving off the appeal of Bolshevism. Using Addams as a case study, I discuss the ambiguities inherent in relief work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Guest lecturer for ENGL 28815:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; From the late nineteenth century onward, writers and artists have been inspired by Chicago and have also created its most enduring representations. Six different creative communities, three from the city's past and three from its present, serve as access points for a broader consideration of the creative "infrastructure" (libraries, cafes, print shops, studios, theaters, newspapers, bars, magazines, radio) that has made and sustained cultural production. Collaboration and cross-disciplinary work distinguish these communities, which stretch from the "Little Room" of the nineteenth century to the Poetry Foundation of today, from the Dil Pickle Club in Towertown to the Hideout in Lincoln Park, and from the Parkway Community House of the WPA era to the Arts Incubator of the Obama age. While the focus is on Chicago-produced literature, all of the arts are explored. Students are expected to produce critical and creative work and to collaborate with a contemporary creative community in producing a public experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ernest Hemingway lived in Chicago for a year and a half, from 1920 to 1921, when he was 21 years old. At the same time, H.L. Mencken claimed that Chicago had become "the literary capital of the United States." Living in various apartments in Towertown–the then bohemian neighborhood surrounding the Newberry Library–Hemingway was influenced by a vibrant literary and artistic scene, including the writers Carl Sandburg and Sherwood Anderson. But it is the untold story of Hemingway's relationship with another young journalist starting out in Chicago, Fanny Butcher, that illuminates Hemingway's lifelong conception of Chicago and the American Midwest.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How will evidence of the cultural, legal and sexual lives of members of the Metz Jewish community challenge our assumptions about Jewish modernization, religion and life in pre-revolutionary France? Jay Berkovitz (author of the upcoming Protocols of Justice: The Pinkas of the Metz Rabbinic Court, 1771-1789) and Magda Teter (scholar of early modern religion and law) provide a rare look at three individual court cases recorded in the Pinkas (Register) of Metz.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the Jews of France, the attainment of citizenship in the early 19th century was far more than a political triumph. The transition from ghetto to emancipation heralded a major transformation in Jewish status, and nowhere was the metamorphosis more striking than in Metz. Looking at the Jews through the lens of French literature, politics and religion, three scholars will consider the far-reaching impact of Jewish emancipation on the meaning of being Jewish in the modern world. With Jay Berkovitz (University of Massachusetts), Lisa Leff (American University) and Maurice Samuels (Yale University).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I want to make three points in particular. The first is that we really have to study urban revitalization from the bottom up to see how and why it has worked. My second point is that we therefore need to rethink the rather top-down way that we often imagine how and why things work in our global system of cities. This includes trying to decenter the United States and thus seeing revitalization in a hemispheric context in which migrants' motivations, efforts, and actions have been conditioned by decisionmaking by governments, a considerable amount of it by foreign governments; and in which revitalization has both depended upon and influenced urban areas far from the cities of the United States. My third point involves both the realm of theory and the realm of policy: at the theoretical level, this means taking a different approach than that indicated by the global cities paradigm; at the level of policy, it means not tailoring municipal initiaties to the "creative class," yuppies, or hipsters, but to immigrants and migrants—and in particular, immigrants of all classes, not just the much discussed and sought-after globetrotting techno-wizards.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Now, there are a lot of reasons for the improved condition and prognosis of the nation's cities—the management needs of global capitalism, the proximity benefits to knowledge-intensive sectors of the economy, and the rise of the historic preservation movement, among others—but today I want to focus on one in particular:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Latin American immigration and the way that 25,000,000 predominantly working-class Latino migrants have moved to U.S. cities—and in the process created a transnational urban system—one that exists not just in the U.S., but also in the built environment of cities and towns across Latin America.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; So today, I'm going to talk about how that has worked Oak Cliff, a neighborhood in Dallas that over the course of forty years has gone from 95% white Anglo to 85% Latino.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>What I would like to do today is to address the theme of "Immigration and Metropolitan Revitalization" by suggesting that we should understand it as a case of transnationalism from below—and that if we do, we can both see the entire phenomenon more clearly and also foster the kinds of policies most likely to expand existing examples of revitalization. I'm going to talk about this in three parts, one at each of three geographic levels, in order to offer a sort of nested account of the big picture. I am going to argue that metropolitan revitalization has been part of the formation of a broader urban system, one that is transnational—but that doesn't simply follow the dictates of "big capital"; rather, it is created by migrants and immigrants with particular features of its own that are best understood at the local, grassroots level.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Today, I'm going to talk about how the Latinization of cities has worked in Oak Cliff, a neighborhood in Dallas that over the course of forty years has gone from 95% white Anglo to 85% Latino. This might seem like a slim reed to support some big claims. But this is&amp;#x0D; just one example of a broader trend. After all, there are plenty more examples of Latinization in urban America. Taken together, these areas represent a transnational transformation of American cities that forces us to rethink the way we talk about urban history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Momentous demographic shifts have yet to be incorporated into existing paradigms of urban history, in part because the field is still bounded by the nation-state. The postwar historiography has remained resolutely domestic even as other areas of U.S. history have been challenged and in some cases transformed by the transnational turn in historical writing.  Moreover, in related fields like urban sociology, geography, and anthropology, much influential research has analyzed cities according to their role in globalization.  After forty years in which some of the most important demographic and economic forces acting on cities have operated across borders, urban historians need to reconsider some of the basic assumptions and explanatory frameworks in the field. It stands to reason to begin with the nation's largest transnational population.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>THE EXISTING HISTORIOGRAPHY OF CITIES in the postwar United States is superb, but the time has come for the next urban history: one that analyzes U.S. cities in their transnational context, particularly as they relate to the Americas. There are two main reasons for undertaking this historical revision. First, the current historiography has reached a chronological and conceptual impasse; second and equally importantly, this approach demonstrates how Latino history can transnationalize the field.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The WorldMap platform http://worldmap.harvard.edu is the largest open source collaborative mapping system in the world, with over 13,000 map layers contributed by thousands of users from Harvard and around the world. Researchers may upload large spatial datasets to the system, create data-driven visualizations, edit data, and control access.  Users may keep their data private, share it in groups, or publish to the world.  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The user base is interdisciplinary, including scholars from the humanities, social sciences, sciences, public health, design, planning, etc.  All are able to access, view, and use one another's data, either online, via map services, or by downloading. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Current work is underway to create and maintain a global registry of map services and take us a step closer to one-stop-access for public geospatial data. Another project is working on tools to support the visualization of spatial datasets with over a billion features. Current collaborations are underway with groups inside Harvard, such as Dataverse, HarvardX, and various departments, and with groups outside Harvard, such as Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania. Major additional contributors to the underlying source code include the WorldBank, the U.S. State Department, and the United Nations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dante Alighieri is known today for his poetic journey through the afterlife, even by those who haven't read a single word that he wrote 700 years ago in Italy. Forget about the proliferation of translations, studies, and college courses touting Dante and his work: when a video game inspired by your Inferno is launched during half time of the Super Bowl, when Don Draper reads your lines on a Hawaiian beach to open a season of Mad Men, and when Dan Brown bases his latest blockbuster on your poem and its enduring influence, you know you've become a word-wide celebrity. What do these and other reinventions of Dante's own creation tell us about the medieval poet and his world? What do they tell us about our world and ourselves? Dantemania will show how studying the past can shape a better future through a clearer understanding of the present.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Grave robbing, hidden bones, empty tombs, exhumation, sacred dust—Dante's Immortal Remains assembles these and other pieces of Dante's lively skeletal history, from his burial in 1321 to a computer-generated reconstruction of his face in 2006. This lecture puts flesh on Dante's bones by showing how the poet's physical afterlife illuminates his evolution from Boccaccio's object of regional rivalry between Florence and Ravenna into Mazzini's prophet of Italy and Mussolini's proponent of Italian nationalism before becoming the global icon inspiring such popular works as Dan Brown's Inferno.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Author of THE CONDEMNATION OF BLACKNESS: RACE, CRIME, AND THE MAKING OF MODERN URBAN AMERICA (2010), Khalil Muhammad explores, in this public lecture, the link between race and crime that historically has shaped and limited opportunities for African Americans. Muhammad addresses how black criminality emerged with the publication of the 1890 census. Comparing white European immigrants to African Americans, he discusses how social scientists seized on statistical data to construct and affirm an enduring discourse of black crime.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>To what extent has thinking about education and the making of education policy substantially engaged issues of race and racism? From 1930s radicals debating whether the "class question" trumped the "Negro question," to Brown v. Board of Education's focus on segregation, but not unequal power and exploitation, Charles Payne argues that there has been an historic avoidance of thinking directly about race and education. Both an esteemed voice on American civil rights movements and a keen observer of contemporary school reform efforts, Payne discusses how historical accounts provoke key questions for educators today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Viva Harlem U": Black and Puerto Rican Students and the Transformation of City College  In the spring of 1969, students at every single division of the City University of New York rose up in protest. The two-week occupation of City College in Harlem precipitated a political crisis in the city and ushered in a major shift in public policy; as a result, it received extensive local and national media attention, but strikingly, it has garnered little attention from historians. The black student movement in New York City won reforms that transformed public higher education and paved the way for the expansion of the black middle class in the New York City region. While the students achieved a great deal, they inspired formidable opposition, which anticipated the political conservatism that would later gain ascendancy in urban, state and federal governments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sponsored by the Center on History and Education and the Program in Social Studies Education in the Department of Arts and Humanities at Teachers College, the roundtable considered the work of two locally based out-of-school programs, Youth Historians in Harlem, directed by Barry Goldenberg, and the Schomburg Junior Scholars Program, directed by Deirdre Hollman. Presentations by Goldenberg and Hollman focused on the ways in which history taught as a dynamic, interpretive process encourages the formation of positive cultural identities in youth and thereby builds a foundation for engagement in civic and political affairs. A discussion followed with comments by Yolanda Sealey-Ruiz, Associate Professor of English Education, Columbia Teachers College, and Cynthia R. Copeland, Public Historian and Educator, about how the programs encourage students to appreciate the relevance of history to their present lives, and how they might serve as models to enrich the teaching of history in the public school classroom.  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The roundtable launched the History Education in Practice Series, co-sponsored by the Center on History and Education and the Program in Social Studies Education.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Invited keynote speaker for the annual Korsyn Lecture at the ARCE Pennsylvania Chapter at Philadelphia:&amp;#x0D; During the 2010 fieldwork season at Tell Edfu several hundred new sealings have been discovered in connection with a late Middle Kingdom administrative structure. They were found in a sealed archaeological context, which is linked to the last phase of use of a columned hall that was part of the mayor's residence at Edfu.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Many of the sealings found in this context show the typical late 13th Dynasty motives but a large portion of them display the characteristics of the Tell el-Dab'a workshop and the Canaanite scarabs of the Second Intermediate Period. The most unexpected finds among this group were eleven sealings showing the cartouche of the Hyksos ruler Khayan of the 15th Dynasty. This is the first time that concrete evidence for a Hyksos king south of Gebelein has been found. This unique discovery opens many new questions about the nature of contact between the Hyksos and Upper Egypt prior to the armed conflict with the Theban kings of the 17th Dynasty. It also requires a serious reconsideration of the chronology of the Second Intermediate Period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Three lecturs given on Tell Edfu at various location in California.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 'The temple of Edfu stands tall, proud and beautiful, one of the most complete structures remaining in Egypt from ancient times. Adjacent to the temple is an ancient city, which thanks to the work by our speaker, we are just learning dates back as far as the Old Kingdom. The city was also the capital of the second southern nome or province.&amp;#x0D; Most major settlements had a "favorite son" local god, which over the millennia, might achieve rise to national prominence - or not. Horus, honored in the Edfu Temple, did. Often represented as a falcon, or a male figure with the head of a falcon, sometimes wearing the double crown, Horus was connected to the sky, the sun, and considered the child of Isis and Osiris. He was worshipped here for several thousand years - the last construction on the temple occurring in the Ptolemaic era between 237 BCE and 57 BCE, into the reign of Cleopatra VII. Yes, that Cleopatra.&amp;#x0D; At Tell Edfu we have the chance to gather completely new archaeological data for the study of an important urban center in southern Egypt and its development during the whole pharaonic period. We know the importance of "city planning" in our own times. Come and learn about the Egyptians' perspective of it during the 5th Dynasty.'</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Post-graduation, students are faced with two questions: (1) What do you know? and (2) What can you make? Liberal Arts Colleges, in particular, do an excellent job with helping students to answer the first, however, we struggle with the second. This talk provides examples of how the "maker movement" on our campus intersects with our on-going work in the digital humanities.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The rapid digitization of texts presents both new opportunities and real barriers of entry to computer-assisted explorations of texts. We present our open-source Lexos software that provides a simple, web-based workflow for text processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.Lexos was created for use with small to medium-sized collections of texts (rather than large text corpora or "big data") and expands the range of statistical and visualization methods within reach of Humanities students and scholars, particularly those who are just learning to employ computational techniques in their work. In addition to examples using the software to explore texts from Old English to classical Chinese, the talk will share how research with undergraduates fuels our interdisciplinary teaching and how our teaching generates new avenues for exploration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many gods and goddesses known in the rich pantheon of Indic religious traditions throughout history have their origins at local level practices that reflect worldly needs of devotees.  Addressing one of the most pressing human concerns of life and death, a goddess or a god with ability to cure the sick enjoyed immense trans-regional popularity. Yet, a claim for a specialty against a specific disease is surprisingly rare. In this context, Parn?as´abari¯, a Buddhist goddess of healing with a claimed specialty against smallpox, and her association with Hindu smallpox goddess S´i¯tala¯, provide an interesting case to understand the changing landscape of healing and medicine in medieval South Asia not only because their appearance helps us discern the historical rise of smallpox epidemics in India but also because their iconographies points to the incorporation of the ritual practices of tantric and periphery traditions into much wider use. By closely examining the iconographies of these goddesses as represented in surviving images and ritual texts from the ninth through the twelfth centuries, Jinah Kim suggest that the pattern of iconographic appropriation and adaptation seen in the development of instrumental iconography of healing demonstrates how the interactions between local medico-cultic practices and normative religious institutions informed trans-local understanding of an epidemic disease, which in turn must have contributed to the development of medical discourse and spread of healing strategies in pre-modern South Asia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The early history of the art of the book in India owes much to the Buddhist practice of commissioning beautifully crafted books for religious merits. Once the idea of embellishing and illustrating text folios with paintings was introduced at the turn of the first millennium, initially in Buddhist context, makers and patrons of painted manuscripts experimented with various design strategies and codicological features, most of which emphasized a manuscript's material quality as a three-dimensional, portable sacred object. By the mid-twelfth century, some Buddhist manuscript makers in eastern India and Nepal began to materialize the concept of a manuscript as a temple in a visually engaging manner. Jinah Kim demonstrate that her analogy of a book as a temple was a consciously chosen design strategy and locate this artistic practice in the larger historical context by drawing comparisons with the design strategies of manuscripts of other Indic religious traditions as well as those seen in temple architecture. Kim also take its ramifications beyond the artistic practice and consider it to be the theoretical framework behind the practice of painted manuscript making in medieval India.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>If reading is a private affair, a beautifully crafted, hand written manuscript ensures that experience be the most private experience of all: it is an object of irreproducible aura. Given this exclusivity, a manuscript experience may be placed at the opposite end of experiential spectrum to the experience of a printed book. Yet, in the case of pre-modern South Asia, where a long history of the supremacy of oral transmission of knowledge prevailed, a manuscript experience was often public. A carefully designed and executed manuscript was often made to serve an important ceremonial role as a ritual object conveying the text, which was performed orally and consumed aurally and visually. This paper explores the public lives of a group of palm-leaf manuscripts prepared during the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries in South Asia by engaging a wide-ranging, long dure´e approach.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Oral history has stood at the methodological forefront of civil rights scholarship. The first wave of oral historians sought to preserve the stories of movement leaders. More recently, oral history historians have played a fundamental interpretive role in transforming our understanding of history of civil rights activism by discovering the complex interactions between local activists and the national movement.  Oral histories have allowed scholars to draw upon the stories of hundreds of civil rights activists, and thus shift the focus of our understanding of how the movement developed and functioned away from a focus on national leaders and their organizations to the community leaders and local activists whose organizing gave the movement its energy and direction. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Since its founding in 1971, USM's Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage has been preserving the stories of those who organized, protested, and fought for civil rights in Mississippi and across the nation. The Center's collections stand as the largest oral history archive of the Mississippi movement.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Artificial humans have populated the human imagination for millenia. In recent centuries, speculation about artificial humans has been the province of fiction writers and, increasingly, scientists (both the mad and the not-so-mad varieties). But the history of the US is also full of real—not imagined—artificial humans. In this talk, I will offer fragments toward a history of the android, showing that its reach extends well beyond science fiction, impacting nineteenth-century feminism, mid-20th-century thought about gender, and the contemporary policing of African Americans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>New projects to scan early modern printed books have radically increased global access to valuable historical documents. Machine readers, however, are woefully unsuited to the uneven inking, anachronistic characters, unfamiliar typefaces, inconsistent orthographies, and multilinguality that characterize these historical documents. The "Reading the First Books" project addresses these challenges through the development and implementation of Ocular, a new digital tool for reading and automatically transcribing books from this period. The project focuses on the tailoring the tool for reading the Primeros Libros collection of books printed in the Americas during the first century of Spanish colonization.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This talk will introduce the practical and theoretical implications of this project for both librarians and scholars interested in colonial documents or cultural analytics. On a practical level, we will discuss how the integration of Ocular into the Early Modern OCR Project at Texas A&amp;amp;M will enable new transcription projects across institutions. From a theoretical position, we will consider how Ocular's transcription process, which simultaneously analyzes patterns in inking, typography, language use, and orthography, opens new possibilities for academic research.&amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D; Reading the First Books is a collaboration between LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture at Texas A&amp;amp;M University. It is funded by an NEH Digital Humanities Implementation Grant.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This workshop will begin with a concise overview and introduction to Pleiades, its mission, and capabilities. Dr. Elliott will summarize current work-in-progress and planned improvements under the aegis of Pleiades' current NEH grant.  The rest of the workshop will focus on interests of audience members as articulated in open discussion. It may touch upon some or all of the following:  How is information organized in Pleiades? How does one download and make use of Pleiades data in other formats? How is new content added to Pleiades and what is the editorial review process like? How can I publish my geographical information through Pleiades?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What can you do with linked data for over 35,000 ancient places, locations, and names? Pleiades.stoa.org has a few answers. The gazetteer, which began as a means of digitizing the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World (2000), grows daily and provides extensive coverage for the Greek and Roman world. It is also expanding into Ancient Near Eastern, Byzantine, Celtic, and Early Medieval geography.  SarahBond  At this workshop, Associate Editor Sarah Bond will introduce the Pleiades community to participants. She will walk them through the history and layout of the gazetteer, discuss the popular contribution and review of our linked geodata, and then help participants make a map of sites within the ancient Mediterranean. Persons at all levels of experience (from "interested" to "expert") are welcome to participate and to contribute at no charge… just like the Pleiades project itself.  This event is co-sponsored by the Corcoran Department of History, the Department of Classics and the Scholars' Lab.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On Friday, March 25, 2016 at noon in the Digital Scholarship Lab at the Rockefeller Library, Tom Elliott, Associate Director for Digital Programs and Senior Research Scholar at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, will discuss the Pleiades Gazetteer of the Ancient World, a community-built gazetteer and graph of ancient places.  Tom will unpack the Pleiades data model and the content curation process that supports it, highlighting the major decision points and criteria in its development history. A key theme of the talk will be conceptual flexibility and reinvention in a digital humanities project.  This event is part of the Spatial Humanities Lecture Series and is sponsored by Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences (S4), the Brown University Library, and the M. B. Mandeville Lectureship Fund. It is free and open to the public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As library digitization efforts produce large quantities of digitized textual content, they create the conditions of possibility for novel inferencing techniques at scale, raising tantalizing possibilities for producing new knowledge about history, linguistics, literary studies and other related fields. However, this possibility will be realized only if tools and infrastructure to explore and analyze textual data can rise to the challenge posed by the data's scale and access restrictions. To this end, the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC), based jointly at the University of Illinois and Indiana University, is creating novel capabilities to enable scholars to have access, for research purposes, to the millions of works that constitute the content of the HathiTrust Digital Library. We will discuss two such capabilities — (1) the HathiTrust+Bookworm (HT+BW) tool; and (2) the HTRC Extracted Features (EF) dataset.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The first, HT+BW, is an NEH-funded multi-university initiative for visualizing language usage trends; the current prototype supports nearly five million books. The second, the HTRC Extracted Features Dataset, makes available, for the same works,  certain kinds of extracted quantitative data at the page level.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In this talk, we will describe:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Technical challenges posed by the massive scale of the HathiTrust Digital Library content, and how HT+BW and the HTRC EF dataset are meeting some of these challenges. Epistemic issues foregrounded by pedagogical uses of HT+BW and the HTRC EF dataset.</Abstract>

Holtzclaw: the Man, the Mission, and the Mask" at 7 p.m. Thursday, April 28 at the Margaret Walker Center in Ayer Hall on the Jackson State University campus. A reception is before the lecture at 6 p.m.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; His lecture will discuss Holtzclaw's autobiography, "Black Man's Burden," along with William Pickens' "Bursting Bonds," in light of Booker T. Washington's "Up from Slavery."  Holtzclaw and Pickens were both Booker T. Washington protégés, but while Holtzclaw remained a Bookerite, Pickens had become by 1922 a supporter of Du Bois.  The talk will examine both men's work, with an emphasis on the influence of Washington's classic autobiography on both.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Holtzclaw Lecture Series is designed to bring nationally recognized scholars and experts on African American education in the South for public lectures in a variety of venues around the state. The lecture is co-sponsored by the Mississippi Humanities Council and the Margaret Walker Center, with major funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Baughan reports on the excavation of the site of Hacimusalar Höyük, located in a plateau above Antalya.  The project is a multi-period mound site that accumulated from the remains of human settlement spanning thousands of years. Thirteen meters high, the mound was occupied from at least the early Bronze Age, circa 3000 B.C., through the late Byzantine period, circa 1200 A.D. &amp;#x0D; The excavations have focused on the Byzantine levels on the top and center of the mound, with several buildings—including a church complete with mosaics and inscriptions. On the slopes that have eroded over the years, the team has excavated early Bronze Age levels. There they have uncovered a number of houses, some of which were burned, preserving the architecture.  Because the architecture is unbaked mud, when it burns it becomes fired into a hard substance like brick, preserving the impressions of the wood, reed, and plant materials used inside the structure of the wall.  The architectural evidence allows researchers to understand how the buildings were constructed, what they were like, and what they were used for. The burnt buildings also conserve intact or broken pottery  and other finds that can be put back together and studied.  On the house floors, the excavation team has found things that were in the room at the time of the fire—things that have to do with weaving, cooking, stone tools or objects. &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The focus of this presentation was the Abdals of Rum - a prominent heterodox group in the early centuries of Ottoman history, more specifically the Abdals of Rum in the eastern Balkans in the 15th and 16th centuries.   The Abdal's ideology and claims to legitimacy was based in part on a comparative reading of the velayetnames (vitas) of two of the leading Abdal saintly figures in the Balkans in the period.  The talk traced their activities such as participation in conquest and colonization, their relations with semi-nomadic groups (e.g. the yürüks), and their place in the bigger picture of Ottoman history.  Eventually, the Abdals experienced gradual marginalization in context of the rise of the centralizing Ottoman state.  The talk focused on the activities of the Abdals in the region of Deliorman (NE Balkans) based on the presenter's own region-specific research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ancient klinai were specialized luxury furnishings designed for reclining at elite banquets and symposia. A widespread Mediterranean tradition of burying the dead on stone replicas of such klinai seems to have originated in the sixth century BCE in western Anatolia, among the dynastic cultures of Lydia and Phrygia and their neighbors. Well preserved examples of the klinai have been discovered and excavated in proximity to the Hacimusalar site.  This lecture explores how this tradition developed, why it flourished during the era of Achaemenid Persian rule (ca. 550 – 330 BCE), and what social and cultural meanings it may have carried for the people who chose to bury their loved ones in this way.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture considers the potential contributions of quantitative and economic approaches to Ottoman legal history. While historians have made some limited attempts to utilize quantitative techniques in order to explore Ottoman court records, almost nothing exists in Ottoman legal literature that resembles the "law and economics" scholarship that has emerged for Western settings. In this lecture, Ergene critically surveys the methodological discussions among Ottoman scholars pertaining to the applicability of quantitative techniques in legal research and also considers the applicability of insights associated with the "law and economics" scholarship to the Ottoman context.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How do we see and share a mental image? In the era of digital imaging and breakthroughs in neuroscience, capturing and sharing a mind's image is a distinct possibility that once belonged to sci-fi movies. The desire and the needs to externalize, circulate, and control a mental image pushed and shaped the creative solutions seen in Buddhist painted palm-leaf manuscripts of twelfth century South Asia. This lecture demonstrated how the pictorial and manuscriptological strategies we find in painted palm-leaf manuscripts relate to the tantric vision practices, and how they opened up a unique way to share visual knowledge.&amp;#x0D;   &amp;#x0D; This lecture was presented as part of the "TT &amp;amp; WF Chao Buddhist Art Lecture Series."&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The matter of Troy in the medieval Latin West sustains a vision of the&amp;#x0D; city of Troy as ever present yet always already destroyed: a city that&amp;#x0D; exists outside of time. In medieval historiography, the Fall of Troy&amp;#x0D; results in the Trojan diaspora and the settlement of Europe by Trojan&amp;#x0D; refugees who flee the burning city; the fall of Troy consequently makes&amp;#x0D; the narrative of European history possible. This vision of Trojan&amp;#x0D; ancestry as a myth of origins is often invoked to express a vision of&amp;#x0D; European futurity. This paper will explore how the /translatio /of the&amp;#x0D; matter of Troy generated its own temporality.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In the absence of the Homeric epics, the matter of Troy was transmitted&amp;#x0D; to the medieval West by the Latin prose texts attributed to Dares and&amp;#x0D; Dictys. These texts represent themselves as the /translatio /of ancient&amp;#x0D; Greek textual traditions and simultaneously as the material transmission&amp;#x0D; of these traditions from papyrus to parchment. The vernacular itinerary&amp;#x0D; of the Latin texts of Dares and Dictys create a distinct Trojan&amp;#x0D; temporality. In the twelfth-century /Roman de Troie/, Benoît de&amp;#x0D; Sainte-Maure insists that the materiality of translation practices&amp;#x0D; allows the reader to participate directly in the Trojan War, while two&amp;#x0D; centuries later, the visual program in a manuscript of Raoul de Presles'&amp;#x0D; translation of Augustine's /De Civitate Dei/ encapsulates the&amp;#x0D; atemporality of Troy as transmitted by Dares.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Europe today has come to symbolize the possibility of peace and cooperation among peoples, but the collective memory of the continent that will be the focus of the 2015-2016 "Year of Europe" program remains haunted by the memory of its violent past.  Has Europe truly exorcised the specter of violence?  Is violence a necessary product of the self-assertion dictated by modern European forms of subjectivity? Our symposium on "Europe Today and the Memory of Violence" brings together speakers from a wide range of disciplines to consider these questions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>2015 marked the 150th anniversary of the end of that pivotal conflict.  As eminent historian and our first speaker Ed Ayers notes, "The American Civil War redefined the United States but it did not resolve all that the war was meant to resolve. The legacies of slavery, the relationship between the states and the federal government, and the meaning of loyalty remain unsettled a century and a half later."  As such, understanding the Civil War remains crucial to understanding ourselves today. The 2015 symposium helped us assess the War's impact on American life not simply in the past, but also in the present and future. Three speakers led us in our assessment – two pre-eminent historians of the Civil War, Ed Ayers (President of the University of Richmond) and David Blight (Class of 1954 Professor of American History, Yale University), and the distinguished literary and cultural scholar Coleman Hutchison (Department of English, University of Texas at Austin).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since antiquity, literature, song, and the visual arts have been viewed as important ways to achieve, promote, and maintain the health of body and spirit. Today, art therapy in medical settings provides a structured forum in which patients and families can openly express and begin to work through issues surrounding hospitalization or medical crisis. In recognition of the Chandler Medical Center's important role in promoting the practices of art therapy, the Gaines Center for the Humanities presented the 2012 Bale Boone Symposium on "Arts and Healing." This five-day symposium brought medical professionals together with humanists, artists, and performers in celebration of what is becoming an increasingly important way of promoting health in people of all ages. Events included a keynote lecture by Elaine Sims, Director of the Gifts of Art program at the University of Michigan; a spoken-word performance by Hippocrates Cafe; a panel discussion about the UK Arts in Healthcare program, followed by tours of the UK Chandler Hospital's art collection; dramatic readings about addiction and PTSD by Outside the Wire followed by community discussions; a participatory drum circle led by Greg Acker and Kristen Hughes of the Kentucky Center for Performing Arts; a screening of Open Window and Q&amp;amp;A with director Mia Goldman; and a concert by Ben Sollee and John Cohen celebrating the opening of Cohen's photography exhibit in the UK Chandler Hospital's West Gallery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The week-long symposium featured a distinguished cast of seven speakers, giving lectures or engaging in debate over the space of five days. Adam Gopnik,, staff writer of the New Yorker, returned to Lexington engage in a debate with Joan Connelly of New York University and the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, over the future of the Parthenon or Elgin Marbles: whether they should be returned to Greece or remain housed in the British  Museum. A similar debate over the role of museums in the preservation of cultural property took place as James Cuno, President and Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, debated with lawyer and archaeologist Patty Gerstenblith of DePaul University. Wednesday's event featured Kwame Anthony Appiah of Princeton University.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Creative placemaking is an emerging urban strategy that has gained momentum nationally but its influence can be seen right here in Lexington on North Limestone (NoLi) and in the Jefferson/West Sixth Street corridors. During her visit to Lexington, Nicodemus, a choreographer turned urban planner and author, will give her insights into this emerging field of community development. Cities, especially small to mid-size cities, are using the strategy to establish themselves as creative centers thereby enhancing their chances of luring creative professionals and entrepreneurs.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Later that afternoon, the public is invited to a free panel discussion on the urban strategy beginning at 4 p.m. Thursday, at the Downtown Arts Center, located at 141 East Main Street. For this discussion, Nicodemus will be joined by a representative of the NoLi CDC; Ben Self, of West Sixth Brewing and the Bread Box; Louis Johnson, of Lord Aeck Sargent; Professor Ron Hustedde, of UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment's Department of Community Leadership and Development; Chris Westover, of McBrayer McGinnis Leslie and Kirkland PLLC; and Jeff Fugate, president and COO of Lexington Downtown Development Authority.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 2009 Lafayette Seminar explored the role of community gardening in strengthening the city of Lexington.  Community gardens are known to improve the health of residential communities, and our city has seen several inspiring community gardens take root and flourish, and the seminar asked, "How can Lexingtonians build on those successes as we continue to define and shape our downtown?" Will Allen, 2008 MacArthur Genius Fellow and founder and CEO of Growing Power, a national not-for-profit organization supporting the development of community food systems, discussed his experience in farming, marketing, and distributing food and the importance of local, national, and global efforts in getting "good food" to all people worldwide. Responses were given by Knox van Nagell, director of the Fayette Alliance, Lexington's land-use advocacy organization dedicated to protecting our renowned rural landscape in Fayette County and strengthening the city of Lexington through promoting innovative infill redevelopment and adequate infrastructure, and Rebecca Self, education director of Seedleaf, a non-profit organization working in multiple sites in Lexington to promote a local food system, work for nutritional justice, teach and model environmental stewardship, and preserve and develop interpersonal connections across barriers of race, age, and socioeconomic status by installing and maintaining community gardens.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The lecture on "Dante, Vision, and the Afterlife" situates the Florentine poet within his broader historical context and examines how he understood the term "vision" both in its more general sense of "seeing" and in its more restricted sense of a "revelatory" experience. Finally, the lecture presents Dante's great poem as the consummate literary and visionary product of the Middle Ages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This richly illustrated lecture will examine the written accounts and visual representations of Hell from Classical Antiquity through the Renaissance. The primary focus will be on Dante's conception of the afterlife and, in this first presentation, on his construction of the Inferno and the ordering of sins and their punishments. We will consider how Dante's vision was shaped in part by the previous tradition but also how it quickly became recognized as a unique and enduring representation of the infallible operation of Divine Justice in the universe. We will also consider the extensive visual influence of Dante's poem on the figurative arts, as well as its voluminous illustrative tradition, ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to modern interpretations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This illustrated lecture looks at the written and visual traditions of Purgatory (very limited) and Paradise and their influence on Dante. In the Florentine poet's day Purgatory was a fairly recent and underdeveloped idea; as a result, Dante enjoyed great artistic/poetic freedom in his invention of this transitional realm of the afterlife. We consider the many challenges Dante faced in composing Paradise, and specifically how to maintain the narrative of the pilgrim's physical journey through the heavenly spheres and how to invent a language and a set of images that would convey the extraordinary and ineffable experience of Paradise concluding with the beatific vision of the Triune God. We examine the large body of illustrative materials that accompany Dante's poem from early manuscript illuminations to the present.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2021 we mark the seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante's death, and it would appear that, even after seven centuries, his masterpiece, the Divine Comedy, will continue to be the focus of academic discussions and research and to exert its hold on the popular imagination in films, novels, and computer games that draw their inspiration from it. This presentation briefly examines the historical, socio-political, literary and artistic contexts in which Dante lived and wrote and, moreover, investigates the many reasons for his and his poem's initial and continuing importance in Western civilization. It seeks answers to a number of questions, among which the following: Who was Dante Alighieri and why did he write the Comedy? Why should his poem have had such great and enduring success? How and why are Dante and the Comedy still relevant in the modern world? In the course of the richly illustrated presentation we consider many examples of Dante's influence on literary, artistic and popular cultures over the centuries, with special attention to his impact on contemporary society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Explore new technology that makes it possible to unearth hidden writings from ancient manuscripts in our libraries. What if we could read the lost writings of ancient Jews and Christians? What could we learn from the revelations and interpretations that were rejected by the Christians under the Roman Empire? In the past, new discoveries of early writings came from digging in caves and graves. This class will demonstrate the images that are allowing scholars and the general public to see beyond the visible. Participants will have opportunities to interact with the stunning digital copies of ancient artifacts that cast new light on lost forms of Judaism and Christianity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Born in Concord, Mary Moody Emerson (1774-1863) grew up in near by Malden, Massachusetts, but her connection to her native town remained close throughout her life. The aunt of Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mary Emerson was a brilliant intellectual in her own right. Not only did Bronson Alcott and Henry Thoreau compliment her "wit and genius," but Henry Thoreau also called Emerson at age eighty-one "the youngest person in Concord." Mary Emerson's most significant writings are a series of unpublished manuscript journals, which she kept for over half a century. In this talk, Sandra Petrulionis will discuss her collaboration with Noelle Baker to produce a digital edition of these writings, Mary Emerson's long history with Concord, and her overall significance to American women's intellectual history."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>n Tunisia, trance rituals animated by praise songs to Sufi saints are not exclusive to members of Sufi orders or participants in Sufi ceremonies. Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, namely, those of women, the Jewish community, Tunisians of sub-Saharan descent, and hard-drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical "journey" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community. Since the rise of Islamism after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, these communities have come under serious threat and musicians, participants, and performance sites have been threatened and attacked. This paper, then, also discusses how this project has become an example of "ethnomusicology in times of trouble" (Rice 2014).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The U.S.-Mexican War (1846-48) created the first generation of Mexican Americans when tens of thousands of residents in northern Mexico became U.S. citizens upon the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo. Although the war and its outcome is central in Mexican history, few Americans understand its importance. Valerio-Jiménez, who is an associate professor in the Department of History at the University of Texas at San Antonio, explores how Mexican Americans transmitted their memories of the war and how these memories have influenced Mexican American identity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On May 27, 2014, Darius A. Spieth, associate professor of art history at the LSU School of Art, presented his current research at the Fondation Custodia in Paris. His talk, "Netherlandish Art in Revolutionary France: The Evolution of Taste, the Art Market, and Prices" (L'art néerlandais sous la Révolution française: Évolution du goût, du marché de l'art et des prix) was delivered in French before an audience comprised of art historians, museum curators, and the general public. The first part of the lecture retraced how historical events and the behavior of collectors, both royal and private, shaped the 18th-century French passion for Dutch and Flemish pictures of the "Golden Age"—the age of Rembrandt, Rubens, and Vermeer. The second part presented new approaches for how to quantitatively measure the impact of the price shock of the French Revolution on the value of Netherlandish art in the Parisian market place. The lecture concluded with a comparative analysis of the French market for Netherlandish "Golden Age" paintings and prints between roughly 1770 and 1830.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I gave this pre-concert lecture for the season-finale concert of Ars Lyrica Baroque, a Houston Baroque ensemble. The concert included the performance of a wedding cantata by J.S. Bach. The lecture focused on the performance and reception context of this and similar pieces, which were performed in the course of wedding banquets. I learned a lot from conversations with the musicians, and the pre-concert audience was appreciative.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent research on the northern frontier of the Inca Empire is beginning to bring to light important new information pertaining to the affairs of the imperial state in the final decades of its existence. The region to the north of Quito associated with the ethnic Caranqui population was the last to be effectively annexed by the Inca prior to the Spanish invasion. The highly militarized landscape of this region speaks to the intensity and the duration of the final Inca wars of conquest. How did this ultimate chapter of Inca history unfold, what strategies did the Cuzqueños deploy to subdue and manage such distant lands, and what role did this region and its people play in the final dramas of the imperial state? These are fascinating questions that are currently being addressed with new archaeological and ethnohistoric data from the northern highlands of Ecuador. In this talk, I present the results of recent archaeological investigations at the northernmost imperial center of Inca-Caranqui. Based on the evidence, we believe this site to have been originally constructed by Huayna Capac to commemorate his hard-won victory over the recalcitrant Caranqui, and subsequently appropriated and re-modeled by Atahualpa to serve as the intended site of his royal panaqa. The archaeological data also suggest the ways in which material strategies of imperial rule evolved over time and as a function of distance from the Inca heartland.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As the North Kharga Oasis Survey team continues to explore the sandy routes that connected the western desert to the Nile Valley and beyond, the archaeological and epigraphic remains from the various rock sites along the desert paths offer an intriguing insight into the ancient travelers' practices and ideas. In this paper I will concentrate on ancient rock graffiti and pictorial carvings from a number of rock sites north of Kharga Oasis. These lonely spots in the western desert were used in antiquity as camping sites and stopovers for weary travelers. The epigraphic materials from these sites, whose study is currently funded by NEH's 2014 Scholarly Editions and Translations award, provide us with valuable information not only about the various uses of the desert routes, but also about the identity and background of the ancient travelers who chose to leave their marks on these rocks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 2001 the North Kharga Oasis-Darb Ain Amur Survey team has been exploring the sandy routes connecting Kharga oasis to Dakhla and beyond. In the course of this survey we have discovered and recorded numerous lonely rock sites that were used in antiquity as camping spots and stopovers for travelers. The epigraphic material from these sites provides us with valuable information about the uses of these desert routes, traveling practices, as well as the identity and background of the ancient travelers who chose to carve their marks on these rocks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During Giovanni Boccaccio's lifetime (1313-75), the common graphic representation of the world changed drastically from conceptually symbolic T-O maps, like the famous Hereford Mappamundi, to cartographic masterpieces that are immediately recognizable today, such as the 1375 Catalan Atlas. In this talk, Prof. Papio will introduce Boccaccio's geographical dictionary (the De montibus, silvis, fontibus, lacubus, fluminibus, stagnis seu paludibus, et de nominibus maris liber) as an important step in the humanistic investigation of the known world that led to the Age of Discovery. Using this work as a test case, he will discuss the use of new technologies for geospatial representations that enhance research and teaching alike.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Michael Papio is Professor of Italian Studies and Director of Graduate Program in Italian in the Department of Languages,&amp;#x0D; Literatures and Cultures at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is the editor and translator of Boccaccio's Expositions on Dante's Comedy (Toronto: U. of Toronto Press, 2009), and, with F. Borghesi and M. Riva, of Pico della Mirandola's "Oration on the Dignity of Man." A New Translation and Commentary (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2012). He is Editor-in-Chief of Heliotropia, a Forum for Boccaccio Research and Interpretation (and official publication of the American Boccaccio Association). Professor Papio is conducting a project for the National Endowment of Humanities Scholarly Editions grant (2015–2018) on Boccaccio's De montibus, silvis, fontibus, lacubus, fluminibus, stagnis seu paludibus, et de nominibus maris liber, which aims to reconstruct a work that verbally visualizes and organizes geographical and mythological information as a dictionary for classical literature with new technologies for geospatial representations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores the problem of how perceptual experiences could be a particularly privileged source of evidence about the external world.  It argues that the pervasive assumption that perceptual evidence must consist in truths is responsible for setting a dilemma between the familiar choices of 20th-century epistemology - skepticism, coherentism, rationalism, and pure externalism - and epistemological disjunctivism.  We can get a better view, with the advantages of disjunctivism but without its costs, if we allow that subjective evidence can consist in falsehoods.  But not every way of doing so can succeed, because we must also correctly account for the defeasibility of perceptual evidence.  I explore and defend a new account of basic perceptual evidence that makes good on this promise.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper argues that it is possible to wrong someone by what you believe about them, and argues that one source of resistance to this idea is that it may put epistemic rationality into conflict with morality.  After refining this objection, I show that it can be solved by allowing for epistemic reasons against belief that are not evidence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The comic strain in Spenser is pervasive but hard to isolate.  Spenser mingles comedy with pathos and mock-seriousness, often playing them against one another in the same passage or episode.  The resulting complexity of tone makes a critical focus on comic elements tricky to sustain:  the comic is always poised against, and qualifying, the monstrous, the lamentable, the pathetic, or the fearful. &amp;#x0D; This paper considers examples from the second half of the Legend of Chastity, where Spenser uses comedy first as a technique for modulating the tone and affect of his narrative as it moves from one episode to another (Florimell in the witch's cottage) and then as a strategy for doubling the narrative back upon itself, in a meta-discursive allegory that extends from Satyrane's combat with the Hyena-like creature through the Squire of Dames' rendition of the Inkeeper's tale from Ariosto to the adventures of Malbecco. This persistent feature of Book III and especially its final cantos reflects the legend's central concern with the ethics of masculine address to women, whether as readers or as prospective lovers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My presentation shows how the spectacular celebration of Dante's six-hundredth birthday on May14-16, 1865 in Florence, the new capital of Italy, doubled not only as a love-fest toasting the young nation's independence but also as a rallying cry to complete unification with the additions of Venice (1866) and Rome (1870). Over three days and nights a tightly choreographed variety of events—from the procession of representatives from cities and towns all over Italy and the unveiling of Enrico Pazzi's colossal Dante statue to musical performances, dances, horse races, banquets, and exhibits—exploited Dante's authority as Mazzini's "Profeta della nazione italiana" to reinforce Florentine (and Tuscan) power on the national stage. Regional tensions in Italy's emerging national narrative resurfaced at the end of May with the timely discovery of Dante's bones in Ravenna and that city's own celebration-cum-memorial service. When Dante's remains were returned to his original tomb after three days of public veneration (June 24-26, 1865), the officiating priest couched the discovery of the poet's bones as "a miracle to justify the prophetic declaration of the hoped-for unity and prosperity of Italy." Drawing on previously unstudied eye-witness accounts and newspaper coverage in addition to existing scholarship, I argue that the national celebrations of Dante in 1865 belie the continuation of regional rivalries and conflicts—particularly among Florence, Ravenna, and Rome—within Italian social, cultural, and political life in the nineteenth century and beyond.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How did the tea plant, essentially a Chinese import, produce aesthetic encounters in Britain and colonial Calcutta in the eighteenth century? In 1786, Colonel Robert Kyd created a botanical garden in Calcutta to experiment with growing economically lucrative plants, including Chinese tea. If successful, the plan would relieve the East India Company of their dependence on the China Trade. It would also usher in a distinctly "British" culture of tea drinking, whose profound impact on multiple visual domains ranging from the botanical to the ornamental, would spill over into gardens and drawing rooms in colonial India.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For over forty years, the Duke Ellington Fellowship has brought the giants of jazz to Yale's concert halls and to the city's public schools. In 1972, Yale's president Kingman Brewster presented the first Ellington medals to thirty jazz greats, including the Duke himself. That year marked the beginning of a series of extraordinary jazz concerts by Eubie Blake, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Robeson, Marian Anderson, Odetta, Max Roach, and Charles Mingus, to name just a few.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For a twist on a seasonal classic, nothing beats Duke Ellington's Nutcracker Suite. Broadway World exclaims, "it was a joy to hear these favorite Christmas classics arranged by Duke Ellington with a soft, smooth feel that certainly got the audience in the spirit of Christmas."  Ellington's rarely heard Sacred Music completes the program.  This Apollo exclusive, with musical direction by David Berger, features a 16-piece orchestra, soprano Priscilla Baskerville, tap dancer Jason Samuels Smith, a mass gospel choir and students from Dance Theatre of Harlem.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Paul Israel will provide an overview of the Edison Papers project at Rutgers University and how it has changed our understanding of Thomas Edison's work as an inventor as well as the broader history of invention and innovation. His overview of the Edison Papers will include a brief history of the project, what it has accomplished to date, and its plans for the future. Dr. Israel's discussion of Edison's career will focus on the central role Edison played in transforming invention from the shop-based practice of lone inventors relying on funding from local capitalists to organized team research in corporate-sponsored R&amp;amp;D laboratories. In addition, he will examine the ways in which Edison pioneered modern innovation practices in bringing his inventions to the market.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our speaker, Paul Israel, has made the study of American invention and innovation his specialty. He earned his Ph.D. in history at Rutgers, and today he is the Director and General Editor of the Thomas A. Edison Papers. To date, the project has produced six volumes of The Papers of Thomas A. Edison as well as an online edition with nearly 200,000 document images. We'll visit that online site with him, and he'll describe for us the mammoth enterprise that involves his staff of a dozen editors and assistants.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have played an important role in the development of democracy and citizenship for black Americans that remains unrecognized. The development and challenges of these institutions reflect but also cast new light on the experience of majority institutions that have long told the story of the history of higher education. The issues explored here are highly pertinent to the goals of the Center on History and Education as they concern the development of engaged citizenship in learners and the ways in which historians shape the dominant American narrative.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Most ethnomusicologists are now familiar with Argentine tango, which during the early 20th century was the music and dance identified with urban, hegemonic, Buenos Aires and its European immigrant population.  Such is not the case with folkloric dances from Argentina, which are representative of the provinces of the Argentine interior and national identity.  Although to this day the major areas of the country all have regional songs and dances, with each song-dance form possessing its own corresponding rhythmic pattern and musical instruments, even Argentine ethnomusicologists are often unfamiliar with how they are learned or danced.  Few ethnomusicologists—most notably Carlos Vega (1954)--have done serious research about these dances, and dance manuals (e.g., Berruti 1954, Falú 2011) have not usually shown how they are taught/learned along with music.  To address this gap, I will present a 90-minute participatory workshop in which I will begin with a brief PowerPoint overview of Argentina's main regional dances based on dance lessons I have taken and my related fieldwork.  Among these dances will be the gato, chacarera, zamba (Argentina's national dance), chamamé, malambo, and carnavalito along with their typical rhythmic patterns and instrumentation.  I will then teach participants how to do the gato and chacarera--dances that beginners start with since they have fixed steps and little improvisation—by following the hands-on methodology and diagrams used at local dance schools.  During rest periods, I will provide additional contextual information about Argentine folkloric music and dance.  Sponsors:  LACSEM and the SEM Dance Section.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Human History Project is a large, long-term enterprise, which aims to build a distributed international database of documented human history using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and Linked Open Data (LOD) to model historical data. Exploiting the ever-increasing availability of historical documents and recent improvements in optical character recognition (OCR), this project aims to create, automatically, an economically feasible digital prosopographical database, which will include series of events (relationships between named entities). Even with the current state-of-the-art OCR and NLP technologies, however, there are still some errors for which we plan to deploy crowd- or expert-sourcing techniques for corrections. For this we are developing a web application to correct errors. The results are stored in the RDF (Resource Description Framework) quad format (i.e., with named graph), which then can be searched via SPARQL query language. In a pilot NEH-funded project entitled "Digital Prosopography of Renaissance Musicians," we are creating a framework that can answer questions not easily answered by Google-like searches or traditional means. Some have referred to it as a "Facebook of the Past." We conducted some initial experiments with promising results. It is hoped that as more historical documents are digitized and as the NLP technologies improve, a wealth of historical information, which was available but difficult to extract, can be more easily searched and retrieved. Our work will have implications for the growing sub-discipline of prosopography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rubble Kings is a documentary film by Shan Nicholson about the birth of hip-hop in the Bronx in the 1970s. The screening of the film at Teachers College was cosponsored by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Office of Diversity and Community Affairs and the Racial Literacy Roundtable at Teachers College. Screened to a large audience as part of the Center's History in Education Practice Series, the film supports goals central to the Center's commitment to better understand the history of education and neighborhood life in New York and in other cities nationwide. The screening was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A with the film director and Dr. Christopher Emdin, Associate Professor of Science Education at Teachers College and author of Urban Science for the Hip-Hop Generation. The film was always shown on Saturday, November 14, 2015 to 120 youths enrolled in the Junior Scholars Program at the Schomburg Center.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session will explore Culion's present-day position as a tourist attraction because of its marine resources and beautiful beaches, and its early twentieth-century history as an "island of death" when it was made as a leper colony  under the American colonial administration. Videos, photographs, songs, and stories of leprosy patients who were forcibly brought to Culion will be used to demonstrate the rich history of this island.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Note: This presentation is part of Western Illinois University's Extension class titled, Learning is ForEver (LIFE class).

		<Abstract>Of all the misconceptions we hold about the making of Joseph Bosworth's Anglo-Saxon dictionary, one of the most tenacious is that Bosworth, like Samuel Johnson, was its "author." In fact, he was a dedicated opportunist with an entrepreneurial flair for enlisting the talents of scores of scholars, antiquarians, and gentlemanly lexical dabblers. Two men to whom he owes uniquely significant debts?Joseph Webb and C.H. Stahl?have remained virtually if not entirely unknown; examining their contributions raises important questions about a mythology of the dictionary's origins disseminated by nineteenth-century reviews and obituaries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>'Marvell's Latin and Wordsworth's Greek: Literature and Literalism in the Classical Tradition'&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Stephen Hinds investigates poetry across languages: he explores moments of connection between texts which approach the condition of translation without quite being the same thing as translation. For his Katz lecture, he examines the work of two poets: Andrew Marvell and William Wordsworth.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The works of Andrew Marvell (1621-1678) contain paired English and Latin poems which were clearly meant to be read together. Focusing on Marvell's famous The Garden alongside its lesser-known twin, Hortus, the first half of the lecture asks what is at stake when Marvell translates Latin into English, and English into Latin. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; William Wordsworth (1770-1850), who began and then abandoned a translation of the Aeneid, had a long and anxious relationship with the classical tradition, a relationship which can be dramatized by examining his first drafts, revisions, and deletions. The lecture's second half visits Wordsworth's classical laboratory, focusing on the post-Virgilian Laodamia and the Greek-inspired Dion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This conference explored what 1) what human intelligence is about; 2) how people have tried, over the past few decades, to get computers to do intelligent things; 3) how sometimes their strategies have imitated the way the human mind works; and 4) how sometimes they have diverged enormously from the way the human mind works.  This includes a historical perspective, including the positive and negative aspects of the more important projects in the area.&amp;#x0D; Dr. Hofstadter is the author of 12 books (the last of which is to be published this year) and is a world-wide recognized authority on Cognitive Science.  His conference was directly related to our NEH project and forms an integral part of the exploration of what is "human intelligence vs. artificial intelligence".  The seminar was open to faculty and students, especially those enrolled in the course Mind, Consciousness, and Computers. Dr. Hofstadter's background in Mathematics, Physics, and Cognitive Science demonstrated by example to the students that understanding or studying, albeit in an introductory manner, is necessary in the modern world.  The funds to pay his honorarium were obtained by cost savings during the first year.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture by historian Jeff Forret offers a legal history of the domestic slave trade based on his current book project of the same name. In 1840, Washington, DC, slave trader William H. Williams unlawfully conveyed some two dozen enslaved convicts from Virginia into Louisiana and had them confiscated by the state. Forret's research chronicles the trader's decades-long struggle with the Louisiana government for the enslaved convicts' return.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A discussion of "What is "appropriate" about appropriate technology?" The question requires more than a technological or engineering response. The abbreviation of "appropriate technology" (AT) can also be read as "alternative technology." The second reading suggests a more radical approach to the same think about what we are doing as we replace the natural with the built environment and turn the world into an artifact. It is thus useful to consider the dialogue between these two terms - using two approaches to one particular kind of technology, energy technology. Whether and to what extent we can develop an appropriate or an alternative energy technology will be crucial to the kind of world-artifact we will construct. This contrast will further distinguish two approaches to an ethical assessment of energy: Type I energy ethics is grounded in a belief that increases in energy production and use are both humanizing and civilizing; Type II energy ethics questions this belief and argues that beyond a certain point, energy production and use become counterproductive. Our technological way of life is currently determined by Type I energy ethics, although Type II energy ethics deserves a hearing. A provocative illustration of the Type II approach to energy will reference energy ethics and policy in China. In the end, a case for the pursuit not just of an appropriate technology but an alternative technology and way of life was made.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Hafez examines the emergence of a culture of productivity in late Ottoman society, a dynamically constructed series of practices and discourses that moralize/idealize/economize work and stigmatize laziness as a social disease. She explores the moralization of work and the marginalization of laziness throughout the reform period; how a new anxiety about productivity generated a series of state reforms to eradicate laziness in Ottoman imperial bureaus and in society at large; and the ways in which public debates on productivity, leisure, and laziness shifted in various historical moments in late imperial society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk will introduce my new book project, Haunted Empire: The Russian Literary Gothic and the Imperial Uncanny, 1790-1850, in which I investigate the connection between the Gothic elements found in numerous Russian literary works of the period and their imperial context. I argue that the persistent presence of Gothic tropes in Russian literature is not a just a tribute to a fashionable Western literary trend, as it is often interpreted; rather, I read it as a key literary form that dramatizes deep historical and cultural tensions, unique to the Russian imperial situation.&amp;#x0D; Focusing on two spaces of internal otherness that figure prominently in the Russian Gothic—the Baltic/Scandinavian "North" and the Ukrainian "South,"—I attempt to reconstruct the specifically Russian tradition of the "imperial uncanny," a fictional space into which the Russian empire projected its colonial fantasies and anxieties and where it produced the doubles and monsters that continue to haunt Russia's historical imagination.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the historiography of modern Japan, the term tenko ("ideological conversion") has come to symbolize the vexed decade of the 1930s. From the mass defections of Japanese Communist Party members earlier in the decade, to the rightward shift of public intellectuals in support of Japan's invasion of China after 1937, tenko signifies the suppression of political opposition and the active mobilization of society for total war. Analyzing this phenomenon in the 1950s, Tsurumi Shunsuke defined tenko as "a change of thought under the coercion of state power." Many subsequent studies have reinforced this definition, approaching tenko as when the state exerted pressure in order to have an individual change his/her ideas. &amp;#x0D; However, we must ask: while the state was clearly trying to eradicate communism and other "dangerous ideas," what did it offer in their place? How did state officials understand the process of "ideological conversion" and its significance beyond anti-communism? Ultimately, are not the state and its modes of coercion not also ideological? My paper explores how, starting in 1936, justice officials invested tenko with ideological importance as they campaigned in support of the new conversion policy. I will reveal how, in a series of journal articles, symposia and public exhibitions, "ideological conversion" inflected tropes of imperial state ideology and consequently became an ideology in its own right.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 1925 and 1945, the Japanese imperial state utilized an anti-radical law called the Peace Preservation Law (Chianijiho) to arrest tens of thousands of people across the empire for what the law defined as threatening Japan's "national polity," or kokutai. Initially used against suspected communists and anti-colonial activists, by the mid-1930s the law was applied to anyone perceived to be challenging imperial orthodoxy, including religious groups, leftist scholars and defense lawyers. While officials were expanding the repressive application of the law, however, they were also developing policies to rehabilitate those they had arrested. Indeed, by the mid-1930s, a policy called "ideological conversion" (tenko) had become the cornerstone of the Peace Preservation Law, in which thousands of detainees were ostensibly rehabilitated as loyal and productive subjects of the emperor. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This talk explores the unique configuration of repression and rehabilitation in the interwar Japanese Peace Preservation Law. I will focus on a small Tokyo-based parolee support group, the Imperial Renovation Society (Teikoku koshinkai), and how it developed many of the protocols that came to comprise the state's campaign to rehabilitate political criminals as loyal imperial subjects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over its twenty-year history, the Peace Preservation Law (1925-1945) was used to arrest thousands of political radicals throughout the Japanese empire for purportedly intending to alter Japan's imperial national polity, or kokutai. State officials saw such intentions as resulting from the infiltration of dangerous foreign ideas such as communism into the Japanese Empire. Consequently they deemed political radicalism "thought crime" (shisohan). Although the law was initially used to suppress thought crime, by the mid-1930s it had developed into an apparatus to reform and "ideologically convert" (tenko) thought criminals into loyal and productive imperial subjects. In this effort, Buddhist prison chaplains assisted incarcerated political criminals with discarding their dangerous thought, thus infusing "ideological conversion" with tropes of Buddhist salvation and spiritual self-negation.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In this paper I draw upon Jean-Paul Satre's notion of "bad faith" in order to explore the use of Buddhism in the Justice Ministry's efforts to reform political criminals in interwar Japan. I will focus on the writings of Kobayashi Morito and other ex-communists who narrated their "ideological conversion" as a process of self-negation and Buddhist salvation, which culminated in their re-identification with the imperial kokutai. While many of these converts continued to work for social welfare and reform into the late-1930s, they did so, they explained, not from political conviction but as selfless acts for others.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the mid-1930s, hundreds of incarcerated members of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) publicly renounced the party and communist internationalism – a phenomenon that came to be known as "ideological conversion," or tenko. While some tenkosha (converts) attributed their decision to leave the JCP to a general exhaustion with political activism and a desire to return to their families, many others regarded defection as a chance to reflect upon problems of communist praxis and to rechannel their revolutionary commitments into the idioms of imperial restoration. A passionate debate ensued from 1933 to 1936 among activist tenkosha over the nature of revolutionary restorationism, a debate that this paper argues expressed the ideological paradoxes of fascism. &amp;#x0D; This paper explores the writings of Nakamura Yoshiaki, Sano Manabu, Nabeyama Sadachika and other ex-communists who saw their individual experiences of ideological conversion as the first step towards the total transformation of Japan, East Asia and the world order. Although different in many ways, these tenkosha struggled to theorize an anti-capitalist, revolutionary transformation of Japan as the redemption and recuperation of a national-essence, one that would enable Japan to liberate East Asia from the yoke of Western imperialism. The more radical their revolutionary proposals became, the deeper they anchored this vision into the mythic prehistory of the imperial past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Ets Haim library is the world's largest repository of books written by descendants of Iberian Jews forced to convert to Christianity who fled inquisitorial persecution during the 1500s and returned to Judaism in new homelands. A number of these converso refugees settled in Amsterdam in the 1590s, whereupon they established a Jewish community that thrived during the seventeenth-century Dutch Golden Age. This talk will focus on works by Amsterdam's conversos housed at Ets Haim, in particular on texts espousing political ideas that contributed to the early-modern European and American shift from monarchy to democracy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Did black educators in de jure segregation simply accept the oppressive schooling conditions created by policies in southern states, or did they use the power available through pedagogy, curriculum, and school climates to seek equality? In this lecture, Vanessa Siddle Walker explores seven ways black educators worked intentionally against unjust schooling opportunities. While the strategies do not condone the oppressive climate in which they worked, the ideas from their era may provide a forgotten map of educational resistance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>New York crystallized as an archetypal "global city" under the pressure of the early Cold War, when the U.S. asserted heightened economic and military dominance, while absorbing unprecedented levels of immigration in the wake of the Holocaust, decolonization movements, and the internal Great Migration.  During this period, the city built a cultural infrastructure that benefitted from, and sought to match, the nation's enhanced geopolitical and economic power.  This talk examines the role of musical "migrant mediators" who navigated new patronage opportunities that arose in this setting, helping to reinforce transnational art and music networks for generations to come.  With attention to concert music, jazz, electronic music, and performance art—and figures ranging from Yoko Ono to Vladimir Ussachevsky—I highlight creators' wildly disparate enactments of national citizenship and world belonging in the arts of the Cold War "global city," their different cosmopolitanisms in counterpoint and contestation with one another.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1957, Edgard Varèse led a series of improvisation sessions in Greenwich Village with jazz musicians, including Charles Mingus, Art Farmer, Don Butterfield, Teo Macero, Ed Shaughnessy, and others.  Little scholarship has explored this episode, a lacuna speaks to a wider, racially inflected rift in historiographies of jazz and non-jazz musical avant-gardes.  Against this tendency, I bring new light to these sessions as a messy and fleeting exchange characterized by mutual curiosity and crossed signals, drawing from analysis of sessions recordings, original interviews, and archival research.  Within a larger ensemble of musicians, I ultimately focus on Edgar Varèse and Charles Mingus in order to tell a larger story about race, citizenship, and the arts in downtown New York during a period of postwar, self-proclaimed American cultural ascendency and national canon formation.  I also ask what it means to grapple with to the laden silences that characterize our archives and historiography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Yoko Ono has increasingly found recognition as a founding mother of 1960s performance and conceptual art movements and a key mediator of transnational avant-gardes.  Yet little scholarship has addressed the earliest works that established her career in New York in 1961.  This lacuna partly arises from the ephemeral nature of those pieces, which confound disciplinary expectations.  While most critical literature on Ono is written from an art historical angle, remarkably few visual traces remain from her early career.  Moreover, Ono's first performances eschewed formal scores and tape recording, discouraging musicological methods of interpretation.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Ono designated her first extended piece "AOS-for David Tudor" (1961) as an "opera."  Her use of this traditional term may seem surprising given the radical nature of the work, which involved the juxtaposition of animal sounds with human voices, a dehumanizing pile-up of human bodies, primal screaming, and amplified playback of speeches by Hitler and Hirohito.  Blending archival research with a critical reading of Ono's intermedial poetics, this paper follows Ono's lead to consider how "opera" clarifies her earliest legacies.  The term speaks to her aspirations as a dramatist accessing a heightened affective register.  It also indicates her desire to "operate" in the world.  To appreciate Ono as an "operatist/operator" is also to apprehend how strongly her work diverged from the Cagean circles in which she then traveled.  Meant to be spread "by word of mouth," Ono's dramas signaled a critical moment in the politicization of the 60s avant-garde, raising questions that haunt contemporary critical practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1957, Edgard Varèse led a series of improvisation sessions in Greenwich Village with jazz musicians, including Charles Mingus, Art Farmer, Don Butterfield, Teo Macero, Ed Shaughnessy, and others.  Little scholarship has explored this episode, a lacuna speaks to a wider, racially inflected rift in historiographies of jazz and non-jazz musical avant-gardes.  Against this tendency, I bring new light to these sessions as a messy and fleeting exchange characterized by mutual curiosity and crossed signals, drawing from analysis of sessions recordings, original interviews, and archival research.  Within a larger ensemble of musicians, I ultimately focus on Edgar Varèse and Charles Mingus in order to tell a larger story about race, citizenship, and the arts in downtown New York during a period of postwar, self-proclaimed American cultural ascendency and national canon formation.  I also ask what it means to grapple with to the laden silences that characterize our archives and historiography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Do virtual reality devices such as the Oculus Rift produce the illusion of an external reality? Or do they produce non-illusory experiences of a virtual reality? Chalmers addresses this question by starting with an analogous question about mirrors. When one looks in a mirror, does one undergo the illusion that there is someone on the other side of the mirror, or does one have a non-illusory experience of someone on this side of the mirror?  He argues that at least for familiar users of mirrors, there is no illusion.  Knowledge of mirrors provides a sort of cognitive orientation (a variety of cognitive penetration) that affects the content of visual experience and renders it non-illusory. Chalmers suggests that familiar users of virtual reality devices have a similar sort of cognitive orientation that renders their experience non-illusory</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our Mutual Friend's Book 2, Chapter 3—"A Piece of Work"—finds Mr. Veneering, that evanescent compere of fashionable London dinner parties, rallying his friends around him so that he may be elected M.P. for the nondescript town of Pocket-Breeches. Almost from the start of the novel, Veneering uses dinner parties to lay the foundation for this other sort of party work, anchoring his feasts in that "innocent piece of dinner-furniture," Mr. Twemlow, whom the omniscient narrator describes in terms that deliberately blur the lines between animate and inanimate matter, consumers and the consumed, human subjects and the gaudy objects feasted upon by the Veneerings and their kind. His blurring, I would suggest, is the point. Set against the novel's beginning on the murky Thames, which includes Gaffer Hexam and Rogue Riderhood's quarrel over whether "a dead man has any use for money," the Veneering dinner party opens up a space for evaluating not the banal stirrings of political partisanship but rather a much more complicated debate, in which Gaffer's natural argument that a dead man cannot own, want, or spend money collides with the unnatural but legal claims of Old Harmon's will, a tool designed to allow him to continue to order the workings of property long after he is dead. Taken from Chapter 5 of my book in progress, this paper examines particularly the dinner parties that frame Our Mutual Friend—the one thrown by the Veneerings in Chapter 2, and the one that closes the novel in "The Voice of Society"—to show how these events posit and critique modern forms of capitalist consumption that commoditize the Victorian subject precisely by underscoring the ways in which these violate Gaffer's "natural" laws of ownership and exchange.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Some of the most widely circulated abolitionist images in the Civil War era were carte-de-visite portraits of formerly enslaved people from New Orleans (three of these images are featured in Purchased Lives). Some of the children in the group were so light skinned that their sponsors and the press declared them "white slaves." The oldest girl, Rebecca Huger, was the most frequently photographed. In "Finding Rebecca" Mary Niall Mitchell (University of New Orleans) explores what is known of Rebecca's life before and after her photograph was taken and how she came to represent both slavery and its demise during the Civil War.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is an illustrated lecture consisting of black and white silver gelatin prints and contemporary historical material looking at the broad sweep of African American history. The photographs, made over four decades by Williams (Haverford College), document mostly anonymous, unheralded, and uncelebrated places in the United States, where Americans--black and white--determined the meaning of freedom. Historical prints, newspapers, and other ephemera provide a historical and visual context for the photographs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Akolet (Austronesian, Papua New Guinea) has personal pronouns and noun markers that distinguish gender and marital status, e.g., ‘unmarried 3sg masculine' versus ‘married 3sg masculine'. While singular pronouns mark both gender and marital status, plural pronouns mark gender only for married people. Given that the choice of pronouns and noun markers depends on social status and societal role, these pronouns and noun markers denote how a person contributes to the life of a community, rather than simply indicating marital status. This analysis suggests that some aspects of linguistic structure cannot be understood outside the cultural context of language use.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Papua New Guinea (PNG) shows very great linguistic diversity, and a number of languages in&amp;#x0D; the country are endangered. There are 47 languages spoken on New Britain Island, and most of&amp;#x0D; them are both undocumented and at risk of loss. Bebeli is the most severely endangered language spoken in the West New Britain region of PNG. The language has been replaced in nearly every domain by Tok Pisin, and younger generations are not learning the language anymore. While I estimate the number of speakers at about 780, including those who may use the language very little, there are only four remaining fluent speakers with solid knowledge of the language and traditional concepts. This talk is a preliminary report on the process of language loss and the assessment of the language vitality of Bebeli, based on interviews and experimental methods that include comprehension and production tasks. In this talk, I first describe the causes of Bebeli's loss, and discuss the current situation of language proficiency and use. I then demonstrate how the language is being lost, based on the results of assessment tests of language vitality. Finally, I examine speakers' perceptions of their own language proficiency.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Department of History at George Washington University is organizing a two-day workshop on citizenship and subjecthood in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa that will be held on March 2 and 3, 2017. The workshop is designed to foster conversations across areas connected by shared histories of colonial/imperial rule, migration and forms of knowledge production. The workshop is organized around three loosely defined themes: frontiers/borderlands and the making of subjects/citizens; law and the "right to have rights;" transnational/transimperial subjecthood/citizenship. There is no set statement or agenda for workshop. We have designed it around people that we thought could have a stimulating and productive discussion on the broad themes of the workshop. We will read each other's papers (some of it work-in-progress), and hope to bring to our discussion a set of conceptual questions that inform our writing on citizenship and subjecthood.  Professor Fredrick Cooper will deliver the keynote address and will participate in our discussions over the two days.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk examined an etching by artist Joshua Kirby Baldrey that he circulated in London (and beyond) in 1788, during the impeachment of Warren Hastings, Governor General of the East India Company. It examined how Baldrey's print crucially sounded both the popular early modern print genre of "Cries" and contemporaneous debates about "specie" in order to illuminate the changing nature of commerce under colonialism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From approximately the mid-fifteenth to the end of the twelfth century B.C. Egypt's New Kingdom empire was served by a fortress and harbor at the Canaanite port of Jaffa (anc. Yapu). The fortress served as a staging ground for regular military campaigns into Canaan and the administration of its imperial territories throughout Canaan. Although the outlines of Jaffa's role has long been known from a handful of textual references, recent research by the Jaffa Cultural Heritage Project under the direction of Aaron A. Burke (University of California, Los Angeles) and Martin Peilstöcker (Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz) has led to a major reassessment of the Egyptian presence in Jaffa. The excavations have permitted not only an elucidation of the history of the fortress, but also the nature of interactions between Egyptians and Canaanites during this lengthy period. Of particular note is the evidence for violent interactions over more than three centuries, climaxing in the late twelfth century B.C. This lecture presents a synthesis of NEH-funded archaeological research between 2011 and 2016 and its historical implications for understanding resistance to and social interaction within the Egyptian stronghold of Jaffa during the New Kingdom.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In places with growing populations of Latino newcomers, barrios have been among the most dynamic neighborhoods in their cities. While their residents often have limited incomes, their property values have been rising while crime is sharply declining; indeed, so much so that these areas are increasingly likely to undergo gentrification. And in places with fewer immigrants, many municipal governments have made official efforts to attract residents from overseas in hopes of harnessing human mobility to revitalize underpopulated neighborhoods—Global Detroit and the Global Cleveland Initiative represent just two programs of this kind. In the meantime, what had been a sustained influx of people from Latin America has largely come to a halt: for example, by the mid-2000s net migration from Mexico had fallen to zero, or, according to some enumerations, become a net emigration. This has not been due to a lack of new arrivals. Rather, it is because many migrants have been departing for their homelands, whether to pursue opportunities or simply retire there; the upshot has been a tide of return migration to Latin America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sheet music is, of course, a vehicle for notating sound-for writing down a piece of music. But sheet music imprints tell us much more than how the music goes, and a careful comparison of details (in conjunction with other sources) often brings into view a hidden history that reveals much about the function of a song. This talk will focus on just one example: the 1917 song "After the War Is Over," in all (well, at least some) of its transformations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our Purchased Lives Exhibit concluded with a book club discussion of "Help Me to Find My People: The African American Search for Family Lost in Slavery. "Book club" members and those present discussed the book at length and the relevance of today's world and those with little background and genealogical  knowledge of their families. The group discussed how not "having a history" affects persons at an emotional level and contributes to the social impacts as well. Physical and medical issues related to not having a clear history of family&amp;#x0D; illnesses and diseases were also noted. Its interesting in our small area, that some families can account back multiple generations (i.e., Revolutionary War, Civil War), where others can only go back as far as 2 or 3.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Rose described her research into the enslaved community at Allendale Plantation (WBR), including what is known about where the people came from and how the population changed with the Second Middle Passage. We included her findings on additional panels which we added to the traveling Purchased Lives panels (along with records from our local courthouse) for the exhibit here at the WBRM. Dr. Rose invited WBR resident Debbie Martin to discuss her new organization "Westside Cemetery Preservation" at her March 16th talk. Mrs. Martin has received great press lately for her research into the abandoned black cemeteries of WBR. She hopes to channel the excitement around her endeavor to clean up and protect these sites which are scattered across the fields of our parish.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Blind Lemon Jefferson was born in Texas in 1893 and went on to become one of the earliest recorded performers of the blues. His unique sound and commercial success in the 1920s made him one of the most popular and influential blues musicians of all time. His music and the blues generally, are a unique genre with themes that reflect our nation's history and the African American experience from slavery, through generations of discrimination, the fight for equality and the everyday challenges we all face today. Blind Lemon's Last Blues is a one-man play with music by Alan Govenar and Akin Babatunde about the day, December 19, 1929, when the legendary blues singer Blind Lemon Jefferson died in the snow in Chicago. Songs and monologues bring to life the voices of Blind Lemon Jefferson and his contemporaries, including Blind Willie Johnson, Lillian Glinn, Hattie Hudson, Bobbie Cadillac, and Lead Belly. Blind Lemon's Last Blues is a story of the deep human need to find purpose in the foibles of life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk takes up the intersection of material acts and literary representation:  how black writers of the 1850s thought about slave uprisings, communal defense against kidnapping and capture, and the founding of maroon communities as models for revolutionary citizenship; how they represented them in literature; and how they theorized literary representation as part of a revolutionary process, "a form of political insurgency" that Franz Fanon describes in The Wretched of the Earth as "awakening the mind," but which Frances Ellen Watkins Harper figures in terms of conversion through encounters with the [slave] sublime.   Harper's writing, speaking, and activism in particular explored the cultural work necessary for sustaining a prolonged battle for emancipation, even if, or perhaps especially when, violent conflict seemed not only imminent, but also necessary.   She draws on local models—Margaret Garner (who killed her youngest daughter, rather than see her returned to slavery in December 1856), the "Tennessee Hero" (who died under torture rather than divulge the names of slave insurrectionaries in 1856) and John Brown—along with a broader black Atlantic and biblical archive as resources for instilling a revolutionary ethos in her readers and as multi-modal response to the complicated, chaotic, and dour outlook at the start of the 1860s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Making WAIVS is a one-day workshop designed to introduce philosophers, art historians, art educators, and museum administrators to the potential that digital image analysis tools might hold for their practices. WAIVS or Workflows for the Analysis of Images in Visual Stylometry is designed to support the use of digital image analysis techniques by researchers in the humanities with little to no computer science background. The workshop will introduce participants to the field of visual stylometry through a series of hands-on exercises using WAIVS. Visual stylometry is a new field that lies at the intersection of art, cognitive science, computer science, and the digital humanities. Researchers in this field use digital image analysis tools to study the image features and image statistics of artistic style. This information can be used to classify paintings by era, school, individual artist within a school, technique, or period within the body of work of an individual artist, and to provide insight into the unique ways that different painters communicate through the subject matter or medium.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Speakers at the workshop include Fitchburg Art Museum Director or Curator, Daniel J. Graham (Psychology of Art, Hobart &amp;amp; William Smith College), Yolanda Gil (Computer Science, University of Southern California), and Charlene Villasenor Black (Art History, UCLA). More information can be found at waivs.org.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; * Making WAIVS is funded by an NEH Digital Humanities Startup Grant (Award HD-248360-16), an American Society for Aesthetics Major Projects Initiative Grant, and the generous support of the Fitchburg Art Museum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This Geballe workshop examines the relationship of oral and written literature from a multidisciplinary perspective, considering topics such as the transmission and textualization of folk literature, the interplay between spoken word and written text, and the sociology of reading and performance.  The general scholarly consensus has been that, the poet of the Iliad was the first to imitate spoken dirges improvised antiphonally by women at funerals and to render these speeches in hexametrical form. I will argue to the contrary that the embedded laments in the Iliad provide us with the earliest evidence for a short genre of hexametrical lament chanted primarily by women at the funerals of relatives and in the cult of Adonis. As we shall see, the very early existence of the latter tradition greatly helps explain why the poet uniquely likens both Kassandra and Briseis to the goddess Aphrodite at the moment when they begin to keen out loud for a dead young man – that is: just as the goddess once did for Adonis.</Abstract>

Propone la yuxtaposición de dos conquistas separadas y a la vez unidas de colonialismo y resistencia. Se analiza la relación compleja entre la conquista incompleta del oriente de Yucatán en el siglo XVI y su "nueva conquista" en los siglos XX y XXI, cuando se inventa la llamada Riviera Maya (Quintana Roo), un espacio re-territorializado como etno-naturaleza por la industria turística.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The reign of Napoleon III, also known as the French Second Empire (1852-1870), boasts one of the wealthiest, most fashionable, and most decadent cultures in European history, with its glorious capital, Paris, as its imperial centerpiece. For those wanting to make their fortune, the lure of the glamorous "City of Lights" was powerful.  When viewed through the experiences of two immigrants, the infamous English courtesan, Cora Pearl, and the great Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoevsky, the extreme highs and lows of the immigrant experience emerge. Ironically, the same challenges—poverty, lack of connections, and foreignness— that Dostoevsky could not overcome did not prevent Cora Pearl from becoming one of the wealthiest and most popular courtesans of all time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the last two years, an unprecedented number of families have fled the Northern Triangle of Central America (Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador) for the United States, seeking asylum from extreme violence and insecurity in their home countries. In response to the wave of families entering the United States, the Obama Administration established special family detention centers to hold mothers and children that claim a fear of persecution if they return back to the Northern Triangle. Scattered throughout the US in remote locations and run by private-prison corporations, these centers have detained thousands of children as young as six months old. In this presentation, Vikki Rogers presented and discussed her experience representing these women and children as a pro bono lawyer at the detention center in Dilley, Texas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This year, the Humanities Institute co-sponsored a two-day (2/24-25) student and faculty trip to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, as part of its continued exploration of diaspora and the effects on generations of American immigrants. The trip was co-sponsored with the Black History Month Committee, the Black Student Union, and the African Renaissance Club on campus. In the past, the Humanities Institute has co-sponsored very successful events with the Black Student Union, and this opportunity provided further strength to our mutual interests and connection.&amp;#x0D; The vision of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History is to be the premier Black Heritage learned society with a strong network of national and international branches and partners. The Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., temporarily on the campus of Howard University. The Association operates as local, state, and international branches promoting greater knowledge of African American history through a program of education, research, and publishing. &amp;#x0D; On their trip, students and faculty attended a luncheon and author event, and for many of the students, this was their first visit to Washington, DC. The effects of this opportunity continue to unfold.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As a Jewish child, Paulette Barrett lived openly with her Jewish-Polish parents in a small French city during the Occupation of France by Germany in World War II. During that time, and well aware of the extreme daily dangers posed by German soldiers, she believed her family was Catholic. Barrett's narrative about her movement from Paris to New York, and from hiding in plain view opened a rich discussion about reckoning a family's—and an individual's—true identity after immigrating to the United States.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As part of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month, the Humanities Institute partnered with the Office of Student Involvement and the Pacific-American Heritage Month Committee to bring two spoken word artists to campus. The program, called Adobo Fish Sauce, facilitated engaging discussions about marginalization and microaggressions through poetry and food. Delivered via food demonstrations and poetry workshops, Adobo Fish Sauce brought the experiences of first-generation immigrants to the center of student-driven discussions. This was a particularly successful and engaging program, enthusiastically received by student participants.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How do marginalized groups challenge authorities? One problem that confronts historians who deal with this question is the lack of sources generated by those individuals. The problem is compounded when dealing with the resistance of colonized and diseased people. Consequently, historians are compelled to use materials that, in the words of Kerri Inglis, "require considerable imagination and creativity." In this presentation, we will explore creative ways to study the history of marginalized groups, like the leprosy patients in colonial Philippines. We will consider songs and rumors as platforms for challenging American colonial authority in the early twentieth-century Philippines.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Business of Art analyzes the financial underpinnings and creative output of artists, printers, publishers, and others in Philadelphia's art world and aims to provide new perspectives on the production and distribution of graphic materials between about 1820 and 1870. I explore such areas as entrepreneurship, innovation, and marketing to more fully understand the interplay of economics, social forces, and art. The project focuses on Philadelphia, but necessarily addresses interactions with individuals and businesses in Boston, Baltimore, London, and other places.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) is a customizable, out-of-the-box toolkit and environment that supports prosopographical research.  It is designed to solve a problem — a complex research methodology — and is not a problem or algorithm in search of a problem to which it may be applied. Prosopography is the process of  discovering, through references to personal names, familial relationships, professional designations, as well as other attributes, pictures of the social, economic, intellectual activities and connections that link them. As the foundational task of prosopography is the collecting of name instances and attributes, it is hardly surprising that prosopographers were early adopters of digital tools, especially databases, which facilitated sorting, searching, and storage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) is a customizable, out-of-the-box toolkit and environment that supports prosopographical research.

		<Abstract>Dr. Barbara Eckstein (University of Iowa) examines the meaning and import of ecoliteracy in the anthropocene, arguing that non-human species have their own stories. As we seek to practice a "wild hospitality" and create communities which are attuned to the natural world, we must attend to the spaces other species make for themselves and recognize the "slow violence" to which they are subjected. This violence is, itself, inescapably bound up with colonization and capitalism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Both America and China have cultural stereotypes. Americans work well in teams, but they love to chit chat at work, wasting many hours every week. Chinese individual star performers are everywhere, but their relationships can sometimes keep them from holding others accountable.  If only the best characteristics from each culture were combined into one organization, what would be the result? Through telling stories about his experiences managing small companies in China, Jared will offer a glimpse of the success that can be achieved by combining the best of both cultures. Language and cultural fluency are essential to making it work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Your Brain is Good at Inclusion… Except When It's Not" presentation examines the domain of diversity and inclusion from the frameworks of human behavior and cognitive neuroscience. It makes the case that "diversity" is really not the problem. Rather, the real issue is closed-mindedness, the hard-wired bias to be cautious and skeptical about people, places, and things with which we are unfamiliar.  Dr. Robbins will show us how open-mindfulness can pay huge dividends as we navigate a complex world filled with different perspectives, values and beliefs.  As always, Dr. Robbins brings all this science-based content neatly packaged in real-world relevance, a good dose of storytelling and laugh-out-loud humor.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture will compare the patterns of indigenization of Protestant Christianity in Republican China and those in the era of Reform and Opening. Whereas indigenous urban preachers of the Republican era had a strong anti-Western proclivity, urban Chinese leaders of the era of Reform and Opening have embraced not only the historic Christian heritage but also made savvy use of China's post-Mao connections with the West. This development indicates that a significant step has been taken in shedding the historical baggage that has saddled the Chinese church in modern Chinese history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this presentation I will talk about my experience living, working, and studying in Japan. I will talk about my experience in the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Program from 2009-2010 in Higashiomi, Shiga, my study abroad experiences in Kyoto and Yokohama, and my work as a researcher of Japanese kabuki theater. My understanding of Japan and the Japanese language has transformed through these many experiences of both traditional and modern Japan. I will explain how my fascination with Japanese popular culture motivated me to explore Japan's rich history and diverse cultural traditions, and how I translate traditional performing arts for students in both America and Japan who are more familiar with Naruto than Kanjincho. I will also discuss how as a student and scholar of primarily early-modern Japan, personal connections with individuals and communities in Japan have not only continued to enrich my own experiences but impacted and enlivened my research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The past twenty years have come to be known as Japan's "lost decades." During this time, Japan has been beset by a series of economic crises, protracted sluggish growth, and increasing competition from its Asian neighbors. As Japan has struggled to meet these challenges, youth culture and subcultures have undergone considerable change. Not only has the period of youth been extended, as it has in many other "developed countries," but a wide range of new and culturally distinctive social types, identities, problems, and lifestyles has emerged as well. This talk takes a look at this rich variety of youthful forms and issues and relates them to broader social and economic forces transforming Japanese society. While presenting an overview of Japanese youth, it discusses in greater detail two high profile topics: youth-driven changes in the world of work and the resurgence of youth activism and counterculture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In many ways, Chinese university students are no different than American college students. They balance busy class schedules with extracurricular activities while trying to maintain a semblance of a social life. Like US students, they worry about what they will do after graduation, what jobs they will have, or worry if they will even find a job. Yet in some major aspects, life as a university student in China is vastly different. How you choose a major and school, what campus life looks like, the teaching style in the classroom, are just a few areas that tend to differ from a typical US university setting. These similarities and differences shape students with aspirations that are at times familiar yet often linked with worldviews quite unlike our own.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After decades of high economic growth, the collapse of a massive asset price bubble in the early 1990s set off a prolonged period of economic recession, sluggish growth, and deflation from which Japan has yet to fully recover. This period has come to be known as Japan's lost decades. This term refers not only to lost wealth, economic opportunities, and jobs, but also to a widespread sense of uncertainty and disorientation in Japanese society. This talk examines the impact of Japan's economic troubles on Japanese society. It asks what has been lost, socially and culturally speaking over the past twenty-five years. But it also asks what has been gained. That is, alongside personal and business losses and the unraveling of venerable social institutions, what has emerged or been constructed? In what ways is Japan better off today than it was in 1989? In what new directions has Japan been heading?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nuclear weapons are an undeniable reality of our times. Nagasaki Atomic History and the Present (NAHP) is an educational website that seeks to have American students be able to imagine and realize what the effects of a nuclear weapon are/were/would be on people. In this talk, I will introduce the contents of our website, how we intend for American students and teachers to use the resource, and the background of the project. We will begin our conversation with a brief introduction of the physical effects of the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Then, I will share several stories of atomic bombing survivors' (hibakusha) experiences of the Nagasaki atomic bombing of August 9, 1945. Lastly, we will watch a brief explanatory video of simulations of nuclear detonations over New York City. I hope that this will encourage students to use the NUKEMAP.com simulator in order to consider what might happen if their hometowns were attacked with a nuclear weapon. NAHP is the result of over six years of small-group collaborations between students, atomic bombing survivors, citizens, NGOs, librarians, audio-visual technicians, professors, and universities around the world. I hope to encourage students to think about what kinds of small-scale, yet global, projects about the human experience they can carry out as undergraduates and beyond.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 2017 Joseph Harper Cash Memorial Lecture The University of South Dakota Despite the historical and linguistic significance of this collection of letters written by Dakota people in the mid-nineteenth century, it will be extremely important to provide a critical introduction to establish the historical and intellectual contexts. Knowing the extreme conditions under which many of the letters were written and the ultimate exile of the Dakota people from their homeland will contribute to a better understanding of the texts.  Including digital facsimiles of the original letters will help establish the literacy and eloquence of Dakota people, and American Indians as group, during a period in history when they were thought to be illiterate.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Numerous urban centers in the Bay of Naples were completely destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD. Pompeii and Herculaneum are the most famous of these, but other areas were also affected and are less understood, even today, because of their location underneath modern development. The villa complex of Oplontis is one of these. Partial excavations in the 1980s found more than 50 skeletons together in one room, killed by the catastrophic volcanic eruption. None of the skeletons had been studied, however, until 2017, when a team of UWF and University of Michigan archaeologists finished the old excavation and began to analyze the human remains. Although only one field season has been completed, this project has already revealed information about Roman life and death in 79 AD. One of the project's long-term goals is to digitally preserve this cultural heritage through 3D scanning and photomodeling, and the launch of a website with publicly accessible models from Oplontis is scheduled to coincide with this talk; audience members will get an exclusive preview.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The seizure of government by corporate power has paralyzed the mechanisms by which piecemeal and incremental reform is possible. Year after year, month after month, working men and women are endure chronic underemployment and unemployment, mounting debts and the collapse of the infrastructures in their communities often because they are privatized. Rising up across the country is an inchoate hatred and what sociologists call diseases of despair seen in the widespread opioid crisis, the suicide rates, mass shootings and far-right hate groups. None of these ills will diminish until we reestablish social bonds and reintegrate people back into an economy where they can have security, including health insurance and pensions, and a living wage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Robert Solomon's "On grief and gratitude" is perhaps the best known contemporary philosophical article on grief. There Solomon makes the provocative claim that there is a duty to grieve – that those who do not grieve or do not grieve sufficiently are subject to "the most severe moral censure," that as a "moral emotion," grief is not only an "appropriate reaction to the loss of a loved one, but also in a strong sense obligatory." While Solomon offer reasons why grief speaks positively of a person's relations with others and why grief may contribute to the bereaved's well-being, he does not offer an explicit argument for the obligatoriness of grief. Here I consider a number of routes by which such a claim might be defended. If there is a duty to grieve, its object must be other living people (those with whom one shares grief at a particular person's death), the deceased for whom one grieves, or oneself. The first two, I argue, are likely to be candidates for duties of mourning, i.e., duties to engage in public or ritualistic memorialization or acknowledgements of the deceased's death, etc. Only the last, a duty to grieve owed to oneself, is a credible candidate for a duty to grieve. For insofar as grief is an egocentric activity, it responds to the death of a person with whom one stands in an identity-constituting relationship and hence involves the attempt to re-establish or place on new terms that relationship in light of that individual's death. The source of a self-concerning duty to grieve is that grief thus represents both an opportunity for, and motivator of, self-knowledge, that is, knowledge of one's practical identity and values. The duty to grieve, I conclude, is a non-enforceable duty to oneself whose non-fulfillment should elicit agent-centered regret.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the most mysterious buildings in the Western hemisphere, King Henri Christophe's lavish neoclassical palace in the rain forest, enthrones the small Haitian town of Milot. Begun less than a decade after the Haitian Revolution for independence (1804) by the first black African king in the Americas, this massive monument was built to showcase Haiti's power and self-confidence.  Despite its status as UNESCO World Heritage and a tourist attraction, the unusual building has never before been the subject of a study. On the basis of unpublished archival sources and exact photographic documentation, this book is the first to publish detailed information about the genesis this extraordinary architecture and the story of its builder.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bien que l'architecture de l'Amérique espagnole et portugaise figure aujourd'hui au nombre des sujets les plus en vogue en histoire de l'art, l'on ne peut en dire autant à propos de celle qui a connu son essor au sein de l'empire atlantique français ; en effet, mis à part un certain nombre d'études régionales portant sur le Québec et une poignée de travaux consacrés aux édifices bâtis en Louisiane, force est de constater, non sans étonnement, qu'elle ne constitue toujours pas un domaine d'étude académique à part entière.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although the architecture of Spanish and Portuguese America today comprises one of the most flourishing subjects in the art-historical discipline the same cannot be said for that of the French Atlantic Empire, which astonishingly—except for regional scholarship on Quebec and a handful of studies of buildings in Louisiana—does not exist as a field. This talk will provide a brief overview of the architectural heritage of the French Atlantic Empire (including the rich collection of plans and drawings in the archives in Aix-en-Provence and elsewhere) and will contextualize French America within the history of Latin American architecture, examining how differing ideologies and utopianisms among the French and Iberian empires led to strikingly contrasting architectural cultures despite shared histories of conquest, settlement, conversion, and forced labour. This paper will encompass North America, the French Antilles, French Guyana, and also Senegal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper posits the importance of large-scale structures to Classic Maya literature and poetics. Building on discourse analysis, the ethnography of speaking, and ethnopoetics, I analyze a selection of narratives to reveal complex structures that may be divided into stanzas, verses, and framing chiasms based on the internal repetition of parallel structures, some of which are of greater scale than the kenning, couplet, or triplet, so often mentioned in discussions of Maya poetics. These large-scale organizing devices coordinate with the temporal structure of the narrative but are not identical with them, even if both work to frame the central axis of the narrative. The comparison of these large-scale features allows for the identification of an aspect of Maya poetics that has traditionally been understudied, but is nevertheless of critical importance to understanding Classic period literature and verbal art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public health was vital to the success of the American pacification campaign and the "civilizing process" in the Philippines during the early years of the twentieth century. In 1905, American colonial officials established a leper colony in Culion, southwest of Manila. Victor Heiser, Director of Health in the Philippines from 1905 to 1915, declared that to protect public health it was necessary to remove leprous individuals from their homes and transfer those who tested positive for leprosy to Culion. In May 1906, the first group of 358 adults and some adolescents were transported to Culion. By the end of 1910, more than 5000 men, women, and children were brought to the island and Culion became one of the largest leprosaria in the world by the 1930s. Citing limited resources and difficulty of pregnancy for leprous women, health authorities segregated male and female patients, and banned cohabitation and marriage in 1907. The patients ignored these restrictions. It was reinstated in 1927, causing a lot of resentment from male and female patients. Opposition to these regulations culminated in a violent protest on March 25, 1932, dubbed "The Manchuria."   Early works on Culion tends to highlight its role as a laboratory for civic experimentation and how it was embroiled in major political issues of the day. Recent studies have highlighted patients' resistance, but they focused on men as leaders and main participants of the 1932 protest. Here, women tended to be presented as followers of men. Gendered assumptions by the state, priests and nuns, and male patients that women needed to be "protected" remains uninterrogated. I argue that women found ways to challenge the gender-based segregation of patients and restrictions on leper marriages within the leper colony. They asserted their sense of self, thereby rejecting the notion of women as weak, mere followers of male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Jubilees Palimpsest Project is working to advance technologies for the recovery of text from illegible manuscripts through the phases of capture, processing, access, and scholarly collaboration. The project takes its name from the only copy of Latin Jubilees, which is joined by the only copies anywhere of the Testament of Moses and an Arian commentary on the Gospel of Luke. After the successful imaging of these erased texts in January of 2017, the scope of objects of interest broadened to other significant palimpsests at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, such as Origen's Hexapla and a fourth-century translation of biblical books into Gothic. A long-term plan to systematically digitize illegible manuscripts is underway. A major advance in capture and processing technology created by the project is Spectral RTI, which combines the advantages of spectral imaging in color processing with the advantages of RTI in texture and interactivity. The addition of texture imaging can aid the recovery of text—for example if now-missing ink left an outline of corrosion on the surface of the parchment—and much more information about scribal practices from the creation and use of the manuscript.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The lecture explores the multi-directional journeys of Armenians in recording history from the Ottoman Empire to the diasporas, particularly to the United States, in the first half of the 20th century, as musicians, as producers and as merchants. Drawing on life stories and examples of commercial records in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere in the diasporas, it illustrates the changing styles, content, and language use in music production vis-à-vis place, trauma and audience / cultural dialogue throughout one of the most turbulent periods of Armenian history. The talk will specifically underscore the cultural, political and identitarian implications of the emergence of recording technology on Armenian communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Gender and sexual minorities seek their fortunes in divination as neoliberalization renders their economic futures ever more precarious and as neoconservative gender politics renders their intimate fortunes ever more bleak in millennial Turkey. Drawing upon media, archival, and ethnographic research on the flourishing economy of commercial fortunetelling, I analyze how and why women and LBGTIQ individuals earn a livelihood from and explore their gendered fates through divination. I demonstrate that fortunetellers are channeled through heteropatriarchal gender norms and limited employment chances into an informal divination economy, where they are criminalized by a secularist ban against fortunetelling and stigmatized by an Islamist condemnation of unorthodox religious practices. I conclude that fortunetellers foster public spaces for the articulation of otherwise marginalized feelings of their women and LGBTIQ clients, ironically, at the expense of the devaluation of the labors of these same underprivileged groups.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sericulture, silk weaving, and textile trade were big business in the early modern Ottoman Empire.  They touched every part of society, from pashas flaunting opulent kaftans to women reeling filament in the hinterlands to merchants trading in Iran, Jeddah, and beyond.  This talk explores a shifting orientation in taste and trade in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as Ottoman subjects responded to the new global fashions by altering both their habits of consumption and modes of production.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite religious proscriptions and practices, currents of alcohol never wholly ceased flowing into Ottoman or Republican Turkey. Until the nineteenth century, most Turks generally observed this prohibition—or secretly evaded it. During and since that time, however, drinking became culturally habituated among many sectors of the population, with the anise-flavored raki being recognized by most as the ‘national drink' of Turkey. Influenced by global temperance movements, especially in America and Europe, traditional moral and progressive medical arguments in Turkey found a common cause in their opposition to alcohol that led to a legal ban in 1920. Fusing arguments of public health and piety, prohibitionist legislation passed by the narrowest of margins. The tenor of these debates included, however, particular references to fiscal insecurity, to the roles of ethno-religious minorities, and to foreign powers that ranged from cautious, to stridently nationalist, and to intolerant xenophobia. Simultaneously, the global currents both for and against prohibition played roles in shaping the arguments found in the Turkish debates. This presentation uses the 1920s Turkish prohibition to trace the roots of current policies and debates dealing with the place of alcohol in modern Turkey.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Power Point presentation by Dr. Michael, Fine Arts Chair at Marist School in Atlanta and the author of "Booker T. Washington and the Art of Self-Representation." The lecture was based on primary documents from public and private collections and touched on the historical significance of Booker T. Washington's visit to Howe Institute in New Iberia on April 14, 1915 just months before his death. In front of hundreds of blacks and whites in the outdoor assembly he stressed that education was the key to find fair solutions to all economic problems. The talk was attended by a 50/50 mixed race audience of about 45 people.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This was an oral power point presentation by Dr. Ian Beamish, who earned his   Ph.D. in History from Johns Hopkins University with his dissertation: "Saving the South: Agricultural Reform in the Southern United States, 1819-1861."  The program, "Sugar Was King in Those Days: Slavery and Wealth in Louisina" was expanded upon with a relevant expressive performance by well known New Iberia storyteller and author, Daphne Thomas. The two hour presentation was held at the theater adjacent to the Bayou Teche Museum at no cost to the Museum and the audience was invited to a free tour of the Purchased Lives Exhibit immediately following. The presentation was well received and attended by a racially balanced audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>11th graders participated in a three part program. They were split into two groups. Each was introduced to the Purchased Lives Panel Exhibit led by Reverend Mary Bashay. That was followed by a presentation of the role of enslaved people in Iberia Parish's sugar cane industry by long-time sugar cane farmer and historian, Joe Judice. After their time with us at the Bayou Teche Museum the students walked the two blocks to Shadows-on-the-Teche Plantation home where the tour narrative had been customized to tell the story of enslaved life on the Plantation before and after the Civil War. Lesson plans and guidelines had been given to the teachers prior to the tour and the discussions were intense and lively. The students were incredibly attentive at both locations and the teachers were very appreciative that this opportunity had been made available to the community. They scheduled another class tour immediately following this one.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mr. John Cummings is owner of the Whitney Plantation which comprises 250 acres of land and was home to the Haydel family, one of the largest slaveholders in the state. The Whitney Museum is dedicated to the history of slavery and became the first of its kind in the U.S. when it opened in 2014. Mr. Cummings received his law graduate from Loyola University, New Orleans and has studied the impact that the Catholic Church had on slavery all over the United States. The lecture was held at the theater adjacent to the Bayou Teche Museum at no charge to us and, even though Purchased Lives had already moved on to its next locale attendees to the lecture were invited for a free tour of the Museum</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This summer workshop was sponsored by Iberia Parish Library as they partnered with the Bayou Teche Museum and Shadows-on-the-Teche. Open to 13 - 17 year olds, we focused on the vast, rich history of the plantation and the family who owned it. That was followed by a tour of the Purchased Lives exhibit at the Bayou Teche Museum to uncover the less-than-pretty truths of the American slave trade and the lives of the slaves that built and worked on plantations not unlike the Shadows.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Classic work on migration by scholars across several disciplines typically assumed male migrants.  More recent work acknowledges that women migrate, too-and not always with husbands or fathers.  Moreover, work attentive to feminist theory explores how the experiences of female migrants might vary dramatically from those of their male counterparts.  In this talk, I explore the riveting case of Cabo Verdean women migrants in the U.S. and Europe, many of  whom have fled poverty, spousal abuse, maternal neglect, and other traumas in the West African nation of Cabo Verde.  Emotional refugees, these women have nevertheless found varying levels of comfort, educational achievement, and even prosperity in new lands, thanks to a combination of strong social networks, more gender-egalitarian morés, government support, and educational programs.  Other women left thriving lives in Cabo Verde to join their children who they had sent afar for better educational and other opportunities.  In these more complicated cases, upward mobility for the children may be counterbalanced by downward mobility for their mothers.  In this talk, I share a rich selection of women's voices to complicate and humanize the stories of migration that hide behind the numbers in the newspapers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture by Dr. Jeff Forret, Professor of History at Lamar University, offered a legal history of the domestic slave trade based on Dr. Forret's current book project based on slave trader William H. Williams.  This slave trader unlawfully conveyed  two dozen enslaved convicts from Virginia into Louisiana and had them confiscated by the state.  Dr. Forret's research chronicles the trader's decades-long struggle with the Louisiana government for the enslaved convicts' return.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Brian Costello presented a timeline of enslavement in Pointe Coupee Parish. Mr. Costello stated that there are three points of commonality that can be found among the enslaved people of the southern part of the United States: closeness of the family, faith in the church, and the love of music. He explained that most of the rhythms and many of the words found in Zydeco and French music are of West African and Caribbean origin.  Mr. Costello introduced Mr. Horace Trahan and Mr. Rodney Bernard of the Ossun Express Band. The talented duo entertained us with a variety of music genres: French La La, Zydeco, two-step, waltzes, and even rock and roll. Between songs, Mr. Bernard and Mr. Trahan answered questions from the audience and told many anecdotes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Penelope McCarthy coordinated a book discussion on ""Remembering Slavery: African Americans Talk About Their Personal Experiences of Slavery and Emancipation"", edited by noted historians Ira Berlin, Marc Favreau, and Steven F. Miller. I chose to have two discussion dates for this particular book in order to offer the presentation to more  people. In this manner, we were able to hold the book talks in the smaller of our two meeting rooms which provided a more comfortable and intimate setting.    The readers in attendance all agreed that putting a face on the persons telling their memories added a heartbreaking touch of humanity to the stories.  The book was well-liked by all of the participants with the exception of one African American woman who said that she is sick of reading about slavery. The rest of us agreed that it is important to talk about this dark period of our history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The format of this presentation was a panel discussion led by Brian Costello and Penelope McCarthy. The discussion was accompanied by a Power Point Presentation prepared by Brian. We presented our personal family story of how we discovered and embraced our large, racially diverse family, the descendants of Charles Gremillion, Sr. (1761-1814) of Pointe Coupee Parish, and his first wife, Marguerite Recuron. Over four years ago, several of us took DNA tests from a popular company. When we got matches as cousins, we got together and that was the start of something monumental.   Present on the panel were 12 of us who had appeared on Genealogy Roadshow. Penelope had made a large family tree chart which she and Brian used to explain the relationships. Family members came from the New Orleans area, Baton Rouge, and Chicago to participate. They answered many question about DNA testing and how exactly our black and white sides were connected. We also discussed how this event has affected our lives in the most beautiful ways. Cameran Battley, our young cousin from Chicago, said that our story is a beautiful story and is truly an American story. She encouraged the others to think about having their DNA tested to find out about themselves. And she said that our story is a prime example of how DNA can be used in a very positive way to unite a family. After the presentation, the entire audience was invited to come to Penelope's house for shrimp etouffe cooked by Gremillion cousin, Troy Battley.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>West Baton Parish Rouge Museum Director and French scholar, Dr. Angelique Bergeron, held a Creole conversation class on November 11, 2017. She was assisted in this endeavor by Brian J. Costello. The size of the group (10) allowed for us sit around a table in an intimate setting which enabled us to face each other while speaking. Dr. Bergeron began by handing out folktales written both in French and Creole. She asked us to look at the text for words that are recognizable as being very similar to English. She stated that a large percentage of words in French and English are very similar.  We discussed three humorous folktales in Creole: "Chyen e Kokodri" (The Dog and the Alligator), "Le Boef e la Veye Tousen" (The Cow and the Old Halloween), and "Karenkro e Manje Poule" (The Buzzard and the Chicken Hawk). She presented a song, "Fam-la Di" (The Woman Said) . Dr. Bergeron taught us how Creole subject and object pronouns patterns closely mimic those of several of he languages of West Africa, which is the area from which the great majority of Louisiana's enslaved persons came.  We conversed in Creole French using the Afro-Creole sentence structure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our last, and very powerful, presentation was given by local scholar, historian, and genealogist Brian Costello. He accompanied his talk with a Power Point Presentation. Some years ago while researching another family, Brian noticed the name "Olivo", a family from Pointe Coupee, and became intrigued with their story. The Olivos were one of many families in Pointe Coupee that had branches "blanc" and "de couleur." The branch of color stemmed from George Olivo II, with one of his enslaved labor force, a black woman named Magdelaine. In 1801, Olivo emancipated Magdelaine, then aged 40 years, along with their (his) five natural children. He died two years later, and in his last will and testament, he left his natural de couleur family all of his property, including a farm on the New Roads side of False River.  Of particular interest to those in attendance was the fact that many of the individuals mentioned in the story had direct descendants present in the audience. Brian brought this amazing story to life while incorporating the history of the times and of Pointe Coupee, in particular, into focus. There were many questions asked after the presentation, and many people stayed after the presentation to speak with Brian.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Lynette Tanner, co-owner of Frogmore Plantation and editor of Chained to the Land: Voices from Cotton &amp;amp; Cane Plantations, presented her book, which focuses on the WPA's slave narratives from Louisiana. She gave an overview of the history of slavery and Louisiana's history in particular. She discussed some of the legislation regarding slavery that was unique to Louisiana. She also read some excerpts from the narratives aloud and used visual aids. The excerpts helped our audience grasp more fully the fact that slaves were real people who were owned and controlled by others.  Ms. Tanner's book features the WP Writer's Project Slave Narratives for Louisiana. Louisiana's transcripts were never housed with other states' narratives at the Library of Congress, they remained at Melrose Plantation in Natchitoches Parish. They are at the Cammie G. Henry Research Center at Northwestern State University. Ms. Tanner compiled and edited the narratives into her book. She provided a concise history regarding slavery in Louisiana. "</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thelma Harrison, a storyteller with the Company Repertory Theatre's Theatre Eclectic, presented a performance piece based on her research of Harriet Tubman. She told the story (in character) of Tubman's life, not just her role in leading enslaved people to freedom via the Underground Railroad, but a story of her own personal life-shaping events and emotions. She then took questions from the audience, engaging with children in particular. Anthropologist and author, Rolonda Teal, then discussed her work related to Los Adaes State Historic Site in Natchitoches, part of the National Underground Network to Freedom program. She talked about El Camino Real de los Tejas and how enslaved persons in Northwest Louisiana would try to escape west to Texas, rather than face a long journey to the northern free states. She also gave a detailed description of a planned escape of more than 30 enslaved people from Natchitoches, LA to Nacogdoches, TX in 1804. She explained the differences between slave societies and societies with slaves.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Reference Coordinator, Noelle Williams, set up the Slidell Library meeting room with chairs and screened Part 1 of this documentary film.  Afterward, she led a discussion with the attendees.  She reported that this first screening had a lively discussion that quickly got off topic due to one patron's comments about Black Israelites and Native Americans.  Williams' and other audience members were able to guide the group back to the film discussion eventually without too much trouble.  Overall, the film was well received.  Flyers and PowerPoint slides were made to advertise the program in our library branches. There are large monitors near the check-out (circulation) desks that play a slideshow of upcoming programs.  Flyers are displayed in all library branches either on a bulletin board or on a rotating rack in a heavily trafficked area for maximum visibility. After the program was over the meeting room chairs got put away and the DVD was stored for the next week's viewing.  Williams said that it seemed the discussion could have lasted even longer because the audience was so into it.  Her total time spent at the branch for this program was approximately 3 hours.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ellen John, Adult Programming Assistant and Assistant Project Director, set up the Slidell Library meeting room to seat 20 people because that's how many had registered to attend.  She had to pull out more chairs once Greenwald got started because more people showed up to listen.  Greenwald gave her speech about the exhibit and how it came to be and why it is important.  She fielded questions and comments throughout, but most were saved for the end of her presentation.  The audience was so involved in the presentation, they had to be ushered out so the library could close on time.  This was the beginning of the wild winter weather so I think even more people would have attended had there not been torrential rain and freezing temperatures predicted for that night.  After everyone left the meeting room, remaining refreshments were disposed of and chairs were put away in the storage closet.  John's total time spent at the branch for this program was approximately 3 hours.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jillian Boudreaux, Adult Programming Coordinator and Project Director, set up the Slidell meeting room to seat 20 people.  Presenter and photographer, Michna-Bales drove in from her home in Texas that day and had just enough time to check into her hotel room and get to the library at the program start time.  Despite that, she was not frazzled and gave a very nice presentation using a slideshow she had created to display on the large drop-down screen in the meeting room.  Those that attended were impressed with her travels and photography knowledge.  She shared several anecdotes of the project's process which made her presentation that much richer.  At the end of the program, she sold copies of her book, "Through Darkness to Light: Photographs of the Underground Railroad", to those who were interested.  Michna-Bales also gifted a copy of her book to the Whitney Plantation to add to their collection, which I still need to mail.  Total time spent at this program was 3 hours (includes set up and break down).</Abstract>

Thirteen people showed up to watch the second part of the documentary and a discussion was held afterward.  Many of those who had attended the program screening for Part 1 came back to watch Part 2, but there were also several others who hadn't registered for either and just showed up.  This time the discussion stayed on topic and was much calmer than the first screening's discussion.  After the program was over, Williams put away the chairs in the storage closet and locked up the meeting room.  Her total time there was approximately 3 hours for this program.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>There were two scheduled book discussions for this title, but the first date that was planned got snowed out.  There were actually a decent amount of people registered to attend, but I think the weather kept them away from attending this second one.  Noelle Williams led a discussion for the people who showed up, and they stayed the entire hour that was scheduled for the program.  The discussion questions that were used were the ones provided in the exhibit binder.  Participants really enjoyed the book and read it in its entirety.  Williams set up chairs and a table for participants to sit around, but since it was just the two of them the program was less formal and more of a visit rather than a formal discussion.  After the program, Williams picked up the meeting room and put chairs and tables away before leaving the branch.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Samantha Brown, Reference Librarian at Madisonville Library lead this program in the Tech Lab.  The room seats 12 people with 12 computers and a large flat screen monitor is on the wall in the front of the room. She displayed the photographer/author Jeanine Michna-Bales' website with images of her book "Through Darkness to Light: Images of the Underground Railroad" on the monitor.  While very quiet in the beginning, the audience soon began to talk about what could have happened. Brown read an excerpt at the beginning from the book "To Be a Slave" by Julius Lester to set the tone. Then she led them on a journey through how and why the slaves would have traveled the way they did. she reported that the audience seemed awed by viewing the different landscapes and said it was cool to learn together about the different routes and how individuals were able to move along the routes. It was a serious atmosphere but one well received. Everyone liked the program and enjoyed the experience. Brown incorporated Google Earth and had slave instrumental music playing during parts of the presentation including one song that was used to help guide the slaves along the routes to freedom.</Abstract>

She reported that they were "really into the book" and wanted to read the next one in the series (they read part 1 of 2).  The discussion involved several ideas about what was not explicitly said in the book which was fun because they got to talk about theories and character motivation, etc. Bryant explained to the group why we were reading the book, but the discussion was mainly about the book and not the exhibit. The total time that Bryant spent setting up, discussing, and cleaning up was about 2 hours.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Noelle Williams set up the Slidell meeting room for this final viewing of the DVD.  She had a nice group who really enjoyed the film and taking part in the discussion afterward.  After the program, Williams' put all of the chairs away in the meeting room storage closet.  Everyone was appreciative of her leading the film programs and gave her such comments on their way out.  Her total time spent at this program was approximately 3 hours. Discussion questions were pulled from educator websites. They were intended for school-age viewers, but Williams was able to improvise to fit her adult audience.  This was the case for all three parts of the film viewing series that we provided for the exhibit.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mr. Honora is a true southern gentleman.  People loved his presentation and several have asked me if he can come back and do more.  He brought a flash drive preloaded with a presentation on how to find enslaved ancestors and provided several tips on how to get "unstuck" during the research process.  It is incredible how many ways there are to find clues while tracing your family history.  Jillian Boudreaux, Project Director, set up and broke down for this program in the Slidell Library meeting room.  More and more people kept coming in that hadn't registered, so she kept having to get out more chairs from the storage closet.  The library provided the laptop projector and screen as well as the podium for Mr. Honora to stand near.  It was a full house and a very informative presentation.  Boudreaux spent a total of 3 hours working the entire program.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Ibrahima Seck drove in from Wallace, La to give this presentation at the Slidell Library. This was an other program with a packed house. A member of the Haydel family (the original owners of the plantation) attended and brought her family tree and some other documents which greatly intrigued Dr. Seck and other members in the audience.  Dr. Seck brought a flash drive with a slide tour of a virtual tour of the plantation grounds and explained about the site's history. There were many questions during and after his presentation, and there were also many familiar names mentioned that were also mentioned in Mr. Honora's presentation.  After the presentation and Q &amp;amp; A session was over, Dr. Seck stayed around and sold some copies of his book, "Buki Fait Gumbo" and went over the Haydel family tree items with the family member who brought them.  Project Director, Jillian Boudreaux, set up and broke down the library meeting room for the program, which totaled approximately 3.5 hours.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"The date of our opening reception was the first day the library system was reopened after three days of closure due to ice. The exhibit's arrival was also pushed back, so the exhibit was not available for viewing. That being said, it was a well attended event, considering a large part of the parish still did not have electricity, the schools were all closed, and several business and other facilities were closed as well. Dr. Keeling gave an overview of the exhibit and gave historical interpretation about the information presented on the panels. People were not upset about the exhibit not being there and lingered for about thirty minutes after discussing the exhibit itself, the upcoming related programs, and, of course, the ice!  The speaker was knowledgeable and was extremely easy to work with. However, he did not interact with the audience at all during the presentation and would not take questions after his presentation.

		<Abstract>This was a night time family program opened to all families and any other participants. The group watched a brief film on Harriet Tubman, read Freedom in Congo Square by Carole Boston Weatherford and An Apple For Harriet Tubman by Glennette Turner. They then discussed what they thought slavery was and what they would think the best and safest way to escape was.  This small (and interesting!) discussion led to the discussion of the legendary freedom quilts. The kids and parents were instructed to make their own patterns on cardstock using color pencils, markers, crayons, or water colors. The children then would have to come up with what their patterns stood for. The plan was to put all the cardstock patterns on a wall to make our own 'quilt' for display near the exhibit.  However, the children were so proud of their work, all but one wanted to take theirs home and display it there.  The lone one left was displayed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Johnson presented a collection, pictures, and historical facts about little known African American women who had an impact on their communities, their country and history.  Dr. Johnson, a professional story teller and gospel singer, tied each women to a song or a poem recitation, and then gave an overview of their lives. She talked about the hardships of the lives of African American women both before and after Emancipation. She presented a lot of little known history and was able to give a deeper, more intimate view of the women who experienced slavery. After an hour program, she received 30 minutes of questions; no one left during this time. She interacted with the audience; a rude question was asked about religion and she turned the uncomfortable moment into a discussion about religion, women, and slavery that went on for about ten minutes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jari came and spoke about breaking through brick walls in African-American genealogy. The program was attended by five people, however, it is likely that the heavy rain Lake Charles experienced that day significantly affected turnout. Jari completed his program and stayed for an additional 20-30 minutes answering questions from some of the attendees. Our Genealogy staff was impressed with the depth and breadth of his knowledge and have discussed bringing him back next year for a spring workshop. Presented at the Southwest Genealogy Library located at the Carnegie Memorial Library branch</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"We had 3 come to the book club; we attribute the low attendance to the minor flooding in Lake Charles that day and the previous day. We discussed how slavery was a stain on American history, and how books like Help Me to Find My People remind us that the desire to form family units, the desire to connect with family, and the desire to strengthen family bonds are universal, and is a large part of what makes all of us human. We discussed the impact of slavery in Louisiana, and how the book dispels the myth that slavery in Louisiana was ""relatively gentle"", and we discussed how we dealt with the repercussions of slavery in the 1800s and how we're still dealing today. The book was a tough read for everyone, but everyone felt like it was an important read, and everyone felt enlightened in some way after the reading. We checked out all thirty books ordered; one African American women's church group checked out ten for their book club. Several more people emailed me their opinions of the books and their ideas of how it tied to today.  Not everyone who checked the book out wanted to attend the physical book club, but there is a lot of interest in the book and we have 17 people on the waiting list for it. "</Abstract>

		<Abstract>r. Janet Allured of McNeese State University presented a program about the lives and conditions of female slaves. It presented in a classroom lecture setting, with people encouraged to ask questions throughout the program and information was presented with historical interpretation. She used different slave narratives as primary source materials and reads excerpts from these to strengthen her presentation. This was our best received program; Dr. Allured is very popular in the community and was an excellent speaker.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the midst of the Great Depression, Governor "Big Ed" Johnson of Colorado declared martial law along the state's southern border with New Mexico to prevent the entry of "aliens and indigent persons" into his state.  In this paper, I present previously unexplored archival records that detail Johnson's plans for the border blockade, deportations, and concentration camps; explain how Johnson's plans played into the nativist union busting attempts of the Great Western Sugar Company; and detail the reactions to these plans of both Hispanic and Anglo residents of Colorado and New Mexico.  I argue that Johnson's blockade not only placed a literal, militarized boundary between the more Anglo state of Colorado and the heavily Hispanic state of New Mexico, but also created the circumstances in which the social boundary between who belonged and who fell outside of citizenship was vigorously contested.  The debates over Johnson's Border Blockade tell us much about struggles over the racialization process of Mexican immigrants and Hispanos in the New Deal Southwest, and offer us an important window into understanding the evolution of ethnic politics in the past and into the present.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>By the late twentieth century, opposition to torture was accepted as an almost universal principle. Yet after 9/11, the permissibility of torture suddenly burst onto the scene as an open question. This presentation analyses how justifications of torture entered the American public sphere via the mainstream media after 9/11, largely ignoring the possibility that torture was already occurring and framing it in hypothetical terms. Rather than grappling with the possibility that the U.S. was already torturing prisoners, media commentators posed the justification of torture as a moral and legal concern with regard to potential future action. In addition, much of this early public debate focused on the fantasy scenario of the "ticking time bomb," in which it is imagined that a terrorist has been captured and will not reveal the location of a ticking bomb set to go off.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>2nd Annual Driedger Lecture sponsored by the Driedger Fund     On social media and in our newsfeeds and mailboxes, heart-rending images of needy or suffering children confront us on a daily basis. They seek to grab our attention, prick our moral conscience, stimulate empathy and political action, or open our wallets for a good cause.     Modern humanitarianism and photography emerged in the 19th century and came of age together. But when did humanitarian campaigns first begin to feature children? How do these images appeal to their audiences, and why does this focus persist? This talk will consider the history of humanitarianism through the lens of the camera and its focus on the child. History suggests that while depictions of children-in-need may appear static and predictable, for over a century they have been deployed in various ways for a surprising array of political agendas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The catalogue entry for Egypt's participation in the Great Exhibition of 1851 lists the displayed objects. They include pipes, textiles, stone samples from the country's quarries, craft goods, samples of fauna, tools as well as some industrial goods. The curated list of objects was meant to present Egypt on the international stage as an ancient, traditional yet modernizing country full of resources. Since that first exhibition Egypt put on numerous displays at international expositions as well as domestically, all staged to focus on the country's modernization, production and industrialization. In international expos ancient artifacts were key aspects of the display, often positioned near the entrance or in a dedicated room with museum-like displays.  In the twentieth century Egypt's staged displays underwent a sort of rebranding aiming to forcibly position the country as modern and progressive both to international and Egyptian audiences. The displays carefully integrated architecture, display design and the selection of objects and industries represented. In this paper, exhibitions held in Cairo in 1926, 1936, 1949 and 1958 are discussed in terms of their architectures and the construction of images that put into sharp relief the state's positioning of the materiality of modernity in the Egyptian context.  Egypt's participation in the 1939 and 1964 New York World's Fairs as well as the 1958 Brussels World's Fair are also discussed. This history of displaying Egypt by the Egyptian state forms an important historical precedent to the Modern Egypt Project at the British Museum. What lessons can be learned from this history, what are the strategies of exhibition employed and how can this history inform museum displays in Egypt and internationally focused on the country's modernity and its material culture?</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>The British Museum has displayed Egyptian objects since it opened in 1759, from a variety of typological, thematic and chronological perspectives. The current galleries reflect approaches from 1979 (the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery, Room 4) to 2014 (Early Egypt, Room 64). Temporary exhibitions, starting with the first UK blockbuster, The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972), have allowed more experimental, nuanced and/or focused presentations, but also displays that diverge from the typically separate treatment of pharaonic, 'Coptic' and 'Islamic' Egypt, such as the exhibition Egypt: faith after the pharaohs (2014/15).

We are now considering how Egypt will be displayed in the next generation of British Museum galleries, prompting this colloquium that aims to gather those researching how Egypt – of all periods – has been represented and interpreted for audiences through displays across the world, both in museums and beyond.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>The Roman Empire produced a rich range of souvenirs and memorabilia commemorating cities, monuments, sporting and theatrical events, and religious rituals. At a time when literacy was limited and visual communication was essential, these objects were a critical means for generating and mediating memory and knowledge of their represented subjects. This talk examines various examples of Roman souvenirs and memorabilia, including glass flasks engraved with scenes of tourist destinations, miniature replicas of famous cult statues, and drinking cups with pictures of famous gladiators and charioteers. The lecture explores how these objects constructed knowledge in an era before mechanical and digital reproduction. When considered in their historical, social, and archaeological contexts, souvenirs and memorabilia shed fascinating light on how objects and images helped ancient Romans conceptualize their world.</Abstract>

At a time when literacy was limited and visual communication was essential, these objects generated knowledge of chariot racing and gladiatorial combat across many Roman provinces, constructed the celebrity of individual charioteers and gladiators, fueled enthusiasm about these sports, and served as complex agents of Roman culture in provinces with diverse populations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk examines a series of engraved glass flasks manufactured as souvenirs of the Campanian cities of Puteoli and Baiae in the late imperial period. The corpus of flasks has not been reassessed since the 1970s. Since then, archaeological discoveries have offered important new contextual information about the uses of these souvenir flasks. The flasks visually emphasize monuments still standing in late imperial Puteoli and Baiae that connected the cities to Rome and its emperors. Although we cannot be sure of the agents behind the flasks' design, it is suggested that the cities' civic leaders and glassworks' owners might have collaborated. The talk also argues that glass was an ideal material for the Campanian souvenirs, straddling the line between luxury and affordability while also being perceived as characteristic of Puteoli and Baiae. The personal and cultural value of the flasks ultimately derived from a combination of their material , iconography, and status as portable souvenirs, which resulted in a wide range of uses after their purchase, from domestic decorations to votive offerings and grave goods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Following a description of how foundations for music and liturgy were registered with the aldermen and entered into their large books, I surveyed the data available from these registers about choral singing, instrumental music, and instrument building (organs, bells). By comparing the yearly costs of the foundations, I argued that the foundation for the mass before the Van Eyck brothers Adoration of the Lamb was for a polyphonic mass. I then discussed how foundations might be used like micro-loans from individuals to churches to accomplish projects in churches today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presentation of my Yale ISM Project for 2017-2018: I seek to identify what not just what  creativity meant to people of that distant time, but what it was with respect to the use of what existed already. In short, I want to know what was created and what was repeated. I also want to determine the value of what was created – its cost, utility, or the esteem in which it was held, for example. I argue that this can be accomplished by combining data gathered from my analysis of three medieval primary source-types from the city of Ghent (in what is now Belgium) with broad interdisciplinary reading – of medieval theology, such as the theology of creation – never before considered for music, comparisons of music in cities, studies of repetition in mathematics, philosophy, biology, linguistics, education, and scholarship on the modern Church. This broad reading will lead me to new approaches to my data beyond those of statistics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Juan Latino (circa 1517 – circa 1595) is Europe's first known poet from the black slave diaspora. Navigating the tensions and complexities of Granada—the last redoubt of Islam in early modern Spain—he mobilized Latin erudition to claim liberty, financial stability, and public renown. This lecture examines the changing narratives of Juan Latino's fama as a poet and educator of Renaissance Spain. In life, he cannily deployed Latin, Europe's only cosmopolitan literary language, to conjure visions of a global empire for king Philip II while also warning this king about how racial bias would diminish his world power. Yet poets in the seventeenth century concealed Juan Latino's accomplishments in vernacular poems steeped in the emerging tropes of minstrelsy. It is fitting, therefore, that a research trip to Spain in 1926 by an intellectual of the Harlem Renaissance recovered the epic of Juan Latino. Indeed, the gallery of notable writers construed by Arthur Schomburg in collaboration with Charles S. Johnson remains a compelling agenda for situating Spain in early-modern literary studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Tunisia, trance rituals animated by praise songs to Sufi saints are not exclusive to members of Sufi orders or participants in Sufi ceremonies. Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, those of women, Jews, blacks, and hard-drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical "journey" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community. This paper emphasizes the important role of women and minorities in cultivating Sufi aesthetics, and shows how Sufism resonates throughout Tunisian society via listening publics associated with numerous genres of music—both "sacred" and "secular"—that evoke the spiritual and therapeutic power of music and trance. Based on ethnographic research between 2009 and 2015, this presentation takes as its starting point the changing politico-religious climate after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 and the concomitant threats to the survival of musical practices associated with Muslim saints.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public video screening and discussion of the Algerian play Apples, as performed in English by the Algerian theatre troupe Istijmam. This gritty, intimate production, full of dark humor and barbed observation, bears witness to Algeria's shadowed past and confronts the complex destiny of the present day. The realities of living under Algeria's authoritarian regime following the country's failed transition to democracy eerily resonate with both the aftermath of the Arab Spring and the present situation in the United States.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The discoveries of Columbus focused attention on the newly discovered but barely known regions on the far side of the earth, a new zone of convergence where East and West met and crossed over into one another. It was now possible to think beyond the "inhabited world" known since Antiquity and to consider the earth in global terms, which is to say as a geometric object viewable from more than one side. The other side of the earth, where the New World formed the nearest part of an extended Asia, was now relayed to Europeans through a series of mediated images, almost immediately becoming a mirror for the European imagination, a place where Europe found itself reflected in distant others. By considering several works of European sixteenth century art and literature, Alexander Nagel explores the dynamic reconfiguration of the world at a time when the imagination of globality was being framed explicitly as a problem of point of view, a problem directly concerning practices of image making and image viewing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Delivered in Italian, this paper studies a series of tapestries made in France under Louis XIV representing "Les Anciennes Indes." Intended as a "portrait of Brazil," and based on eyewitness drawings and studies made in Brazil by Dutch artists, the tapestries also contain many Asian elements, such as an elephant, a rhinoceros, and various other flora and fauna, as well as Asian silks. The paper asks why one part of the Indies could not be separated from other parts in this very famous and much copied cycle.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Asian and American (and sometimes African) toponyms, peoples, terrain, flora, fauna, atmospheres, and cultural productions mingled in the European consciousness long after Columbus, and even as the Pacific was being regularly traversed by European galleons. The still dominant organization of historical study by field is structurally predisposed to misrecognize these associations as confusions or mistakes. Letting go of this armature can, however, bring into view a world in which Amerindians really are Indians, Mixtec codices are oriental manuscripts, and biblical sites are to be found in South America—artifacts of a resilient if malleable view of the world sustained by cosmological principle, cartographic convention, narrative forms, and protocols of collecting and display.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Buddhist mountain range of Wutai on China's northern frontier emerged as a unique site of shared religious devotion among the diverse constituents of a multicultural and multilingual Qing empire (1644-1912). Manchus, Mongols, Tibetans, and Han-Chinese all venerated the mountain and imbued it with their own sense of divinity. This lecture examines several widely circulated panoramic maps of the mountain range that were created during this period, demonstrating how the maps actively asserted a pluralistic vision of Mount Wutai and participating in the creation of a dynamic pilgrimage culture.   Wen-shing Chou is an assistant professor of art history at Hunter College, City University of New York. She received her B.A. from the University of Chicago, M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in the visual and material culture of Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism from the eighteenth to the twentieth century. Chou's articles have appeared in the Art Bulletin, the Journal of Asian Studies, and the Journal of the International Association of Tibetan Studies. Her most recent work will appear in the forthcoming issue of the Archives of Asian Art. Chou is currently a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Join Dr. Donald Anderson for a screening and discussion of La Haine (1995). When a young Arab is arrested and beaten unconscious by police, a riot erupts in the notoriously violent suburbs outside of Paris. Three of the victim's peers, Vinz (Vincent Cassel), Said (Said Taghmaoui) and Hubert (Hubert Koundé), wander aimlessly about their home turf in the aftermath of the violence as they try to come to grips with their outrage over the brutal incident. After one of the men finds a police officer's discarded weapon, their night seems poised to take a bleak turn.  Dr. Donald Anderson is an instructor in the English Department at Westchester Community College where he teaches courses in writing and literature. His research focuses on horror, exploitation, and cult cinema with a specific interest in the history of Italian horror cinema. His publications can be found in the journals Horror Studies, Rhizomes, and Gothic Studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2010 Dr. Gary Klein left the Middle East after conducting a plethora of interviews to help bring a more vivid picture of the region back to his classroom. One of those interviews was with Lara Tabsi, a young woman from Aleppo, Syria who had felt that her country was the "safest place on earth." To the shock of nearly every observer, civil war broke out in Syria a few months later. Recently, Dr. Klein interviewed Lara a second time to discuss what went so tragically wrong in a place so dear to her. Join us for a video screening and discussion with Dr. Klein of this remarkable interview.  Dr. Gary Klein is a history professor at Westchester Community College.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Why should we still read fiction with all that's going on in the real world? In these divisive and troubled times, reading fiction is often depicted as an impractical luxury or outdated distraction. In this talk, Nadine Knight makes that case that reading—and especially reading fiction—is more important than ever. Engaging with literature hones your imagination and empathy; in short, it could make you a better person, one more adept at interacting with the world and working for justice. This talk will share some of the current research into reading practices and offer examples of how fiction can be used productively to help us understand some of the tensions at stake in current American popular and political discourse. Dr. Nadine M. Knight is an associate professor of English at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. Her teaching and research interests include African American literature, the American Civil War, and American popular culture. She is currently working on an article about Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Inaugurated in 2008, the Louisiana Book Festival's One Book, One Festival discussion group continues at the 2018 Louisiana Book Festival. Participants are invited to read the same book in advance and then join the scholar-led discussion with others at the festival.  The One Book, One Festival selection for 2018 is the Depression-era comic masterpiece The Great Big Doorstep: A Novel, by E. P. O'Donnell. The novel centers on the Crochets, a Cajun family who live in a ramshackle house between the levee and the Mississippi River. The Crochets dream of one day owning a stately plantation befitting the magnificent cypress doorstep they have salvaged from the river and proudly display outside their humble home.  The memorable characters in this novel have their own concerns: the patriarch, Commodo, is full of wild bravado as he fluctuates between scheming, laboring, and malingering; his wife reigns as the queen of retort, though toughened by years of making do and doing without. The Crochet children also cope with personal struggles: Topal, twenty, restless, and moody, and recently dumped by her fiancé; Arthur, eighteen, attempts to strike out on his own while dodging the coddling of his mother and the fury of his father; Evvie, almost fifteen, plans to join a religious order after renouncing a lover; and twins Gussie and Paul, and baby T. J., provide an ongoing chorus of laughter and tears.   Biography Katherine Henninger is Associate Professor of American Literature at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where she specializes in southern literature, visual culture, childhood studies, and women's and gender studies. She is the author of Ordering the Façade: Photography and Contemporary Southern Women's Writing. Her current book project, Made Strangely Beautiful: Southern Childhood in U.S. Literature and Film, is supported by a Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture discusses key elements of network analysis from the perspective of historians, providing insights into the possibilities and limitations this method offers. It is the intent of this lecture to illustrate a journey and learning process in modelling historical networks. After an introduction on the basic terminology and concepts of network analysis, we will discuss how we can transform archival sources in network data. This is not an easy task: archival research often presents us with complex, fragmentary and uncertain data that are hard to reconcile with the required precision of digital technology. To bridge this gap, we will discover how the use of multi-layered networks may provide a powerful outcome to tackle both complexity and fragmentation in archival data. Following that, we will see how we can enrich and quantify our archival based network with data-mining from datasets. By doing so, I will show how various network measurements can highlight the different roles that individual nodes play in a network. In explaining these methods, I will use examples from my own research on early modern correspondence networks.   EMDA2017 prepared me to teach this introductory course on network analysis in historical research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Finding Cleveland is a documentary short film that follows Charles Chiu and his family on an emotional journey to Cleveland, Mississippi to visit the gravesite of Charles' father, KC Lou.  In less than 48 hours, Charles has many surprising encounters with the local townspeople, who help fill in some blanks about the father never knew.  He also learns of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a discriminatory law against Chinese immigrants, and the struggles his father faced in a pre-civil rights era.  The 13-minute film was followed by a discussion with the California filmmakers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk was presented a conference organized by Arche: Philosophical Research Centre for Logic, Language, Metaphysics and Epistemology, entitled "Medieval Logic and Metaphysics."  The talk describes the origins of the phrase `Ockham's Razor' in the works of a 17th-century Thomist commenting on Aristotle's De anima.  It shows why this attack misses it mark in the case of Rufus and Scotus, and how it leaves Thomas Aquinas' views open to attack.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is trauma? How do past injuries continue to shape the present? And what does it mean to study the history of destruction?  John M. Kinder grapples with such questions in a wide-ranging discussion of two research projects. The first is Paying with Their Bodies: American War and the Problem of the Disabled Veteran (University of Chicago Press, 2015), a history about how World War I transformed American attitudes and policies toward disabled veterans. The second is his current book project, a global history of zoos and zoo animals during World War II. Both projects suggest that war trauma has left its mark on American bodies, institutions, and ideas in profound and unexpected ways.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Tree of Pearls" was a slave from the Central Asian steppe who became the beloved concubine of the Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt in the mid-13th century.  Through that relationship, she rose from slavery to become regent and then the appointed sultan of Egypt for three key months in the summer of 1250. This is the story of how she got there, and how she commissioned innovative works of art and architecture that charted a new course for Cairo.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the course of an NEH-funded project to transcribe and translate the lyrics of central Javanese gamelan music, it became clear that something highly unusual was going on in the way some of the texts were being used. Indeed, the singing in traditional Javanese gamelan music represents an extreme, among the world's vocal musics, of fragmentation and discontinuity. Moreover, many of the texts are difficult for the average listener to understand because of their heavy doses of archaic words and their subtle word play, made all the more incomprehensible by melisma, the surrounding thick instrumental texture, breaths taken mid word, and the aforementioned fragmentation. As a result of this, much of the time, audiences--and even singers--do not pay much attention to the meaning of the words that are being sung. In much of the more recent repertoire, however, the words do take on a more expressive role, and become a focus of attention. Using Rossana Dalmonte's typology of text-music relations in vocal music (2004), I propose to demonstrate the range of roles the lyrics play in Javanese gamelan music, depending on the literary and musical genre, and to consider the question of why certain texts, of extremely high literary value, are used over and over, despite being only vaguely understood, at best, by most singers and listeners.

		<Abstract>This inaugural public conversation provided context for the overall exhibition and associated series of programs at Xavier University of Louisiana. Drs. Erin Greenwald and Sharlene Sinegal-DeCuir engaged in a lively discussion of the exhibition's origins, outlining the history of the domestic slave trade particularly from the Upper South regions to that of the Deep South, primarily Virginia to Louisiana. The historians were able to discuss the history of slavery in the United States, discuss the domestic slave trade, the legacy of slavery in regards to current events that are consciously or unconsciously connected to the concept of "race" in America. In the latter part, this allowed the conversation, comprised of both the historians as featured participants and the audience, to discuss how much history is known in contemporary society, why it is important to know history, the place of New Orleans as a major slave market during the domestic slave trade and the city's rich history/heritage. The discussion sparked curiosity about the exhibition and about the topics scheduled for subsequent sessions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session focused on both the origins of the black press and its role in the African American and African Diaspora community. The featured participants, Renette Dejoie-Hall (Publisher, the Louisiana Weekly; the oldest continuously publishing black-owned newspaper in Louisiana), Anitra Brown (Managing Editor, the New Orleans Tribune), Shearon Roberts (Xavier faculty specializing in journalism) were the featured speakers. Also joining the conversation as an audience member was Beverly McKenna, Publisher of the New Orleans Tribune. The session moved from a conversation highlighting the history of the press' role in the African American community to the need for cooperation and collective effort in current times amongst African American-centered organizations. The conversation was fluid, dynamic, highly informative, and the session ran approximately two hours instead of the scheduled ninety minutes. This point is important to note because the attendance was terribly low. This was the evening of the freezing temperatures and weather warnings which proved a deterrent to people leaving their homes and campus members venturing out as well.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session partnered two scholars of early African American literature who were at different points in their careers. Dr. Jerry Ward, retired distinguished professor joined Dr. Jimmy Worthy, new assistant professor of Xavier University's English Department. More than any other session in the series, this discussion was the most academic in terms of content and delivery. Both professors provided exhaustive overviews that infused history, close readings of references from slave autobiographies, and literary theory. The early part of the discussion seemed more like an academic conference amongst peers rather than a public discussion. Nonetheless, the immense knowledge that both scholars brought to their opening comments were well received. It was apparent that both Drs. Ward and Worthy possessed an exhaustive knowledge of the antebellum era, literary works and authors, literary conventions often found in slave narratives, and that each genuinely enjoyed studying/researching the topic. This last point is what allowed nonacademic audience members to remain invested in the session. Each scholar's enthusiasm for studying slave narratives was infectious.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the midpoint of the series, programming shifted in week four to expand how audiences might engage, interpret, and analyze their experiences in viewing the exhibition. We moved the event from its regular location in the library to the St. Katharine Drexel Chapel, a space conducive for contemplation and reflection. We moved the exhibition panels to the chapel entryway so that audiences engaged them walking into the sanctuary. The tabernacle had been removed so that the space became more inclusive for non-Catholics/Christians. By far, this was the largest group of participants in the series: Sr. Eva Marie Lumas, interim director, Institute of Black Catholic studies; Drs. Wilfred Delphin, Marcus Ballard, and Prof. Joy Meade of Xavier's Music Department; Prof. James Shade of Xavier's English and Creative Writing Program; Dr. Valerie Francis of Nicholls State University; and Dr. Robin G. Vander, Project Director. Each featured participants analyzed the exhibition and panels and identified their respective entry point into a conversation responding to the exhibition. Delphin, Ballard, Meade, and Francis used music, instrumental and vocal, in responding to the exhibition. Shade discussed the exhibitions content in relation to how cinema attempts to illustrate the African American experience. Dr. Vander used excerpts from Toni Morrison's novel Beloved to reflect upon the African American experience in slavery. Sr Eva Marie Lumas provided personal and theoretical insights into the exhibition and the African American experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This event pivoted the series from objective engagement of the exhibition to providing audience members with viable information for researching their family origins and histories. The event featured historian Dr. Wendy Gaudin and professional genealogist Jari Honora. The event was extremely well-balanced in the style and content delivery. Dr. Gaudin shared family photographs and oral histories as aids in discussing the reasons for researching her family history, how race factored into research, her personal feelings upon learning her family's history, and the different ways she has produced outcomes based upon the research. Mr. Honora offered relatable measures for researching family histories: photographs, letters, vital records, correspondences, employment records, and land records, among others.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The concluding session of the series attempted to extend the first session's topic, "Why History Matters," by considering what place history maintains in our contemporary understandings of race and slavery's legacy—and to help us understand how the human spirit endures despite prolonged struggle and the institutionalized inequality/inequities. This session featured Dr. David Robinson-Morris, director of Xavier University's Center for Equity, Justice, and the Human Spirit; arts educator and cultural historian Freddi Evans; communications and marketing professional Laura Tennyson; and historian Leon Waters. The featured participants discussed their respective work in producing and promoting accurate information about African American history in Louisiana. All of the community partners expressed concern that African American history is often presented through the lens of tourism and doesn't wholly engage the black experience in ways that are balanced, accurate, or probative.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing on several decades of Critical Race Theory scholarship and historical studies of race in the United States, this project challenges the black/white binary by demonstrating the centrality of Mexican Americans to one of the most important school desegregation cases in U.S. history, Keyes v. School District No. One (1973). The case hinged on Mexican American racial identity. If they were white, then many Denver schools were not segregated. If Mexican Americans were nonwhite, however, then those same schools were segregated. Beyond the courtroom, Denver citizens contemplated this issue on their own, a debate that remained relevant long after the Supreme Court ruled. Many people, moreover, used Mexican American children's ambiguous racial identity to challenge the court's desegregation plan. The existence of such racial uncertainty, I argue, is one of the hallmarks of the operation of race in modern America. People's inability to categorize Mexican Americans as either white or black, and subsequent debates about Mexican Americans' location along the racial spectrum, raised questions about the legitimacy of court-ordered desegregation. Racial uncertainties thus served an important ideological and political purpose: in the post-civil rights era, when overt racism was no longer socially acceptable, anti-integration voices utilized the indeterminacy of Mexican American racial identity to frame their opposition to school desegregation. That some Mexican Americans were among these voices only added credibility to the idea that court-ordered desegregation was not only illegal, but un-American.</Abstract>

		<ApplicationNumber>AQ-51123-14</ApplicationNumber>
		<Abstract>How is peace understand and experienced?  Using the nexus of community and culture as a lens to explore what peace means, this interdisciplinary panel presents three papers to examine cultural meanings of virtue, race, and conflict in order to understand the attainment of peace or its limitations.   Literary scholar Donna Gessell claims that Flannery O'Connor's short story "The Artificial Nigger" should be included in the category of "overlooked or under-appreciated visions of peace." O'Connor contests notions of peace and violence through her characters' confrontation of culture and place in the short story, published in 1955. Philosopher Yi Deng explores how the illustrious virtue in the Great Learning is an approach to peace. Instead she argues that reinterpreting illustrative virtues in The Great Learning, ignored in the wave of reviving Confucian political philosophy, will advance the development of Confucian political virtues in more global contexts.  Historian Michael Proulx explores the idea of community in strife and the modeling of virtuous behavior that emerges from it in Ancient Greece and India. He makes the point that, while intense conflict plague each community, model values and virtues of peace occur within the domestic settings of each culture, where hospitality customs temper adversaries  as people strove to develop their own unique forms of peace. It will examine sections of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey to develop a view of ancient Greek standards of virtue within a community under the stress of conflict and war.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Daats'i´in [dtn] is a B‘aga language (Nilo-Saharan?) spoken by less than 1000 people in northwestern Ethiopia near the Sudan border. The language is closely related to Gumuz [guk] and up until 2013, scholars were not aware that either the langauge or the people existed. Dr. Ahland confirmed the existence of this language and ethnicity in 2014 when she made her first fieldtrip to the area. The B‘aga languages exhibit typological rarities not known to exist in other African languages, e.g. verbal classifiers (Ahland 2010). Furthermore, Daats'i´in and the Gumuz languages don‘t always exhibit the typical patterns found in the neighboring Nilo-Saharan languages and for that reason, at least one linguist has proposed they form an isolate family (Dimmendaal 2011) and should not be considered Nilo-Saharan as they traditionally have (Greenberg 1963, Bender 1997, Ehret 2001). Dr. Ahland will present an overview of her research on Daats'i´in which is funded in part by a DEL (Documenting Endangered Languages) fellowship jointly sponsored by NEH and NSF.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public sharing of food and gifts remains important to St'át'imc communities of interior British Columbia today despite decades of prohibition by Canadian authorities.  The archaeological record offers evidence that public events involving large-scale food preparation and sharing were commonly practiced at least since ca. 1300 years ago.  Yet, we have little understanding of variation in how such events were developed and operated.  We know even less about the social dimensions of public rituals involving sharing of food and goods.  This paper explores the archaeology of food-related public ritual (feasting) and related activities (e.g. potlatching) in the Middle Fraser Canyon of British Columbia.  Drawing data from the Bell, Bridge River, and Keatley Creek sites, we assess (1) variation in time and space in the nature of such rituals; (2) potential socio-economic and political explanations for variation; and (3) relationships between historical and contemporary practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper focuses on understanding how lineage-based and clan-based connections structured labor patterns and access to prestige/power within a multi-generational housepit (HP54) over time. The Bridge River site (EeRl4), located in the Mid-Fraser Canyon, British Columbia, Canada, was generally egalitarian, but shows variation and situated power-differentials in terms of wealth and influence of individuals or groups based on familial, lineage, and/or clan connections across several generations. These relationships were likely negotiated both within households and externally between houses as well. Due to the longevity of occupation of HP54 (roughly 346 years), this housepit may be representative of long-lived kin groups who were connected to the initial construction of the housepit, and/or to each sequential expansion of the space. Clan-based resource connections and spatially-defined traditions were potentially passed down through generations, a possibility reinforced by the presence of multifloor/multi-generational site furniture (e.g. in situ grinding stones). Through an examination of changing patterns in subsistence resource management and the use of space across these occupational floors, we examine micro- and macro-scale shifts in lineage-based connections or alliances at this household level in order to illuminate how such connections interplay with the development of prestige-based social distinctions and subsequent access to power.

		<Abstract>The interior Pacific Northwest landscape contains a system of waterways that coalesce to form three major drainages with outlets in the Pacific Ocean. Substantial evidence has been provided that complex hunter-gathererfisher communities occupied sites in these river drainages during the late Holocene. Some chronological frameworks suggest there are similarities across the region while others indicate disparate timing of cultural developments spanning material culture, settlement patterns, and sociopolitical organizations. This paper presents Bayesian models for late Holocene sites the Middle Fraser and Upper Columbia River areas. Results suggest that while region-wide chronologies have been adopted, Bayesian models predict very different occupational histories for villages in the Mid-Fraser and Upper Columbia River areas. Intensive excavations from the sites Bridge River (EeRl4) and Slocan Narrows (DkQi-1, 2, and 17) will be case studies for discussion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To gain support for the public zoo movement, between 1890 and 1910, zoo boosters praised zoological parks as institutions that would "advance knowledge" by supporting both scientific research and education. Zoos around the world, therefore, staged countless experiments. In this talk, Dr. Vandersommer's wil tell the story of these experiments, conducted in the National Zoological Park around the turn of the 20th century. The first deals with primatology. The second, aeronautics. Though from a contemporary perspective both experiments appear to be failures, they will point us toward the wild natures and unpredictable animalities hidden beneath the anthropocentrism of modern science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Greek dramatic festivals are most strongly associated with fifth century BCE Athens, but in fact, they continued into the Hellenistic and Roman periods, and spread widely across the Eastern Mediterranean. In this talk, Dr. Skotheim tours the dramatic festivals of Asia Minor, bringing to life the human activity in and around the grand theater buildings of the Roman Era, and introducing the groups of people who participated in the festivals, from the benefactors who supported them, the actors and poets who traveled to compete, and the diverse spectators who gathered to watch.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In recent years Turkey's population of ethnic Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic group from China's northwest Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has rapidly increased due to political turmoil in their home region. As the Uyghur community rebuilds their lives in Turkey, they are also seeking ways to preserve their unique culture, as it is under assault at home. This talk explores the political situation in China leading to challenges for Uyghurs in Turkey, and describes some initiatives undertaken by the community to preserve their culture amid these challenges.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the course of this talk, my aim is to convince you that the standard narrative of 18th- and 19th-century American constitutional history is incomplete.  It is incomplete because it focuses too narrowly on two great constitutional moments: first, the founding period from 1787 to 1791, when the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were drafted, debated, and ratified; and second, the period between 1861 and 1870, which witnessed the Civil War and the drafting, debating, and ratification of the Reconstruction amendments.  For many scholars, the founding and Reconstruction are the two signal events in American constitutional history prior to the 20th century.  Bruce Ackerman of Yale has deemed them "constitutional moments" – periods in which "We the people" engage in conscious acts of constitutional creation and transformation.  The founding and Reconstruction certainly qualify.  The founding was the point of origin, and Reconstruction was the moment of reckoning.  My focus today, though, is not a point or a moment.  It is a four-decade-long argument.  The period between 1815 and 1861 – the end of the War of 1812, right here in New Orleans, and the beginning of the Civil War, up in Charleston Harbor – was a constitutional era unto itself.  It was not simply the hangover from the founding; nor was it merely the prelude to the Civil War.  These 46 years contained within them an unparalleled period of creativity in constitutional thought.  The constitutional world looked different in 1861 from the way it had looked in 1815.  The landscape of what was constitutionally possible changed over the duration of what I term the interbellum period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Women of all countries are painfully impressed by the fact that men alone prepare the future, that not one of them has been summoned to take part in the task of reorganization, and that the international code of which they will have to bear the consequences will have been established entirely without them; once again people will speak in their name and decide for them without consulting them."  With this protest, issued in March 1919, Western feminists put the peacemakers on notice that women were not going to allow the historic peace negotiations to unfold without them. In the months that followed, thousands of women in Europe and across the globe congregated, spoke out, and took to the streets, claiming the right to help shape a new international order after the First World War.  Paris was the unofficial center of world government in 1919, and some of the most influential female activists of the day converged there. This lecture will focus on two among them: French suffragist Marguerite de Witt Schlumberger and Chinese feminist and nationalist Soumay Tcheng. Both came to Paris to represent women's interests at the Peace Conference. Both would leave a permanent mark on the terms and outcome of the Versailles Treaty. Schlumberger and Tcheng marked women's formal entrance on the modern diplomatic stage, even as they gave rise to a truly global movement for women's rights.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A ship ostensibly owned by reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, the Hughes Glomar Explorer was actually the centerpiece of a 1970s-era CIA effort to salvage a sunken Soviet submarine from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The program, among the most ambitious in CIA history, originated in near-complete secrecy in 1968, the tail end of an era of intelligence permissiveness in which Congress exercised oversight so minimal as to constitute "undersight," one historian has remarked.  Over the operation's seven-year lifespan, however, U.S. government efforts to shield certain facts from the public in the name of national security received closer scrutiny, leading, some say, to the dawn of the "sunshine era." Indeed, Glomar's unauthorized disclosure by journalists helped usher in the "Year of Intelligence," as the New York Times dubbed 1975, prompting members of Congress to call for a probe of the mission's high cost and even higher risk.  Yet the outing of the ongoing intelligence activity also provoked a backlash among defense hawks, who vilified the media for damaging U.S. security and warned that congressional regulation would only cripple the CIA's ability to perform cutting-edge initiatives such as the "Great Submarine Snatch" in the future.  That backlash restrained the press as well as Congress in their attempts to investigate U.S. intelligence activities, and it is among the reasons why Glomar played an underappreciated but pivotal role in saving the CIA from the clutches of transparency. In short, Glomar changed the conversation, working to establish new limits on the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate culture of disclosure. And this presentation tells the program's history both to provide an alternative perspective on the 1970s, a decade known for expansive openness, and to weigh in on America's perennial struggle to balance the demands of democracy with the need for secrecy in national security and foreign policy.</Abstract>

The program, among the most ambitious in CIA history, originated in near-complete secrecy in 1968, the tail end of an era of intelligence permissiveness in which Congress exercised oversight so minimal as to constitute "undersight," one historian has remarked.  Over the operation's seven-year lifespan, however, U.S. government efforts to shield certain facts from the public in the name of national security received closer scrutiny, leading, some say, to the dawn of the "sunshine era." Indeed, Glomar's unauthorized disclosure by journalists helped usher in the "Year of Intelligence," as the New York Times dubbed 1975, prompting members of Congress to call for a probe of the mission's high cost and even higher risk.  Yet the outing of the ongoing intelligence activity also provoked a backlash among defense hawks, who vilified the media for damaging U.S. security and warned that congressional regulation would only cripple the CIA's ability to perform cutting-edge initiatives such as the "Great Submarine Snatch" in the future.  That backlash restrained the press as well as Congress in their attempts to investigate U.S. intelligence activities, and it is among the reasons why Glomar played an underappreciated but pivotal role in saving the CIA from the clutches of transparency. In short, Glomar changed the conversation, working to establish new limits on the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate culture of disclosure. And this presentation tells the program's history both to provide an alternative perspective on the 1970s, a decade known for expansive openness, and to weigh in on America's perennial struggle to balance the demands of democracy with the need for secrecy in national security and foreign policy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Pamonag will speak on the subject of patient activism in the Culion leper colony during the first three decades of U.S. rule in the Philippines. Beginning in 1906, American health officials in the Philippines ordered the mandatory confinement of Hansen's disease patients to the island of Culion, southwest of Manila. This was the American colonial government's solution to what health officials suggested was a major public health problem in the Philippines. Health officials had downplayed Filipino patients' opposition to the order for mandatory confinement and the ban on marriage and cohabitation that was introduced in 1907.  This lecture critically engages with how a gendered rhetoric of protection muted women's voices in both contemporary accounts and scholarly works on resistance in Culion. The pervasive rhetoric of protecting women's health, wellbeing, and morals obscured women's exercise of agency and struggle for autonomy against male and female authority figures. Drawing on contemporary accounts of a March 1932 protest against the ban on marriage and cohabitation as well as some primary evidence from the patients themselves, this presentation will bring several examples of women's subversion of such rhetoric to the forefront. They rejected the notion of women as mere followers of Filipino men and wards of the Catholic nuns and the American colonial state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The metaphors of aim and target are frequently invoked in antiquity to define the probable character of rhetoric (indeed, all arts).  Medicine is a frequent analogue to rhetoric; both present the question of the validity of an art that has an "end" but can't guarantee its results. This lecture discussed the concept of the stochastic as it was invoked by Quintilian, Pausanius, and Aelius Aristides. I argued that this theorization of the stochastic complicated the means/end ratio that underwrites an instrumentalist view of rhetoric.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public lecture provided as the final event of the seminar, which is described below:  The technical concept of a decision tree (similar to the parlor game of 20 Questions) is embedded in an interactive interrogatory relying on human responses to a series of Yes/No questions, as described in: A. C. Weislogel, C. R. Johnson, Jr., et al., "Decision Trees and Fruitful Collaborations: The Watermark Identication in Rembrandt's Etchings (WIRE) Project at Cornell" in: Lines of Inquiry: Learning from Rembrandt's Etchings, Ithaca [NY] 2017, pp. 32-57.  The underlying decision tree concept has broad utility in image classification of a variety of maker marks found in the supports of art works, including, for example, panel maker marks and guild brands. This short course will prepare the students to be sophisticated users of this emerging technology and potentially to pioneer its use in other cultural heritage applications.  This talk was also given on November 1, 2018, at the National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>C. Richard Johnson Jr., Fellow in Computational Arts and Humanities at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute and Geoffrey S. M. Hedrick Senior Professor of Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, introduced a groundbreaking project utilizing a computer-assisted decision tree for identifying watermarks in works on paper by Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669). Such an analysis helps art historians to date various states of prints as well as offers a more profound understanding of workshop practice. The lecture was followed by a panel discussion with Prof. Johnson's collaborators Andy Weislogel (Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art) and Margaret Holben Ellis (Institute of Fine Arts, New York University) and The Frick Collection's Associate Research Curator Margaret Iacono.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sparked by prior research into matching manufactured patterns in historic papers, and motivated by a desire to bring together engineering and humanities students to generate novel research useful in the prints and drawings field, the WIRE project has since 2015 worked toward the objective of developing an online identification tool for the watermarks on Rembrandt's etching papers, based on the concept of the decision tree. WIRE has proceeded with important oversight from colleagues at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, and engaged curators and paper conservators at over a dozen northeast institutions, assessing their Rembrandt watermarks with the aim of uniting them in an expanding database. Johnson and Weislogel will discuss the WIRE project's motivation, background, and technical concept, describe its development through a succession of research seminars and its role in a recent traveling Rembrandt print exhibition, and share some of the project's results and offshoots.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Welcome to a special talk by Dr. Frederick H. White, Professor of Russian and Integrated Studies at Utah Valley University.   Influenced by the theories of Pierre Bourdieu and Pascale Casanova, this lecture explores the role of the scholar and translator in consecrating the work of Ernest Hemingway for the Soviet literary market. Ivan Kashkin (1899-1963) was the leading translator of the American writer's work into Russian, including a two-volume edition of selected works in 1959, and the author of the influential critical-biography, Ernest Hemingway, published in Moscow in 1966. Translation is a crucial element in the attainment of literary capital beyond the author's national borders, therefore Kashkin's publications legitimized Hemingway's literary works within the Soviet Union as early as 1934. This lecture will concentrate on Hemingway's introduction to the Soviet market in the 1930s; his exclusion from it due to the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls; Kashkin's "re-reading" of Hemingway in the 1950s, and publication of his Soviet biography in 1971.   Speaker's bio: Dr. Frederick H. White is Professor of Russian and Integrated Studies at Utah Valley University. He has published six books and over thirty academic articles on Russian literature, film and culture. He is one of the leading specialists on the writer Leonid Andreev and has published in the areas of Russian Modernism, psychology and literature in the Russian fin de siècle, the economics of culture and post-Soviet cinema. Recently, he has published a book of memoirs, interviews, scholarly essays and biographical documents that relate to the recently deceased filmmaker Aleksei Balabanov. At present, he is working on a book provisionally titled Hemingway in the Soviet Union, which concentrates on the efforts made by Soviet literary agents to interest the American author in the Soviet experiment.  #talk #culture #literature</Abstract>

Partnerships between MIPoPS and local heritage organizations have brought hundreds of tapes from moldering, musty shelves back to the big (and small) screen! Video tape is a magnetic medium with a shelf life of less than 30 years. This means that any existing video tape is at critical risk of being lost to degradation – forever. MIPoPS is fighting the good fight against this magnetic media crisis, and they want to share the gems that they've discovered in the process!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This panel will provide several hands-on demonstrations of AMIA Open-Source tools including vrecord, ltopers, audiorecorder, and QCTools detailing their use and opportunities to customize them to fit your workflow. We will also review opportunities in digitization that were earlier unfeasible. We will discuss recent collaborative work amongst archivists to address videotape digitization issues. This includes the creation of online manuals, resources, and software, such as those developed in the amiaopensource GitHub organizational account. We hope to address the challenges of analog tape digitization and demystify the entire process of planning and maintaining in-house audio and videotape digitization projects. The audience will gain a clearer understanding of digitization objectives, as well as, how and where many digitization practices achieve or miss the mark.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Salapia, a port-town on the Adriatic Coast of southeastern Italy, was founded in the 1st c. BCE and developed as a vibrant urban settlement, maintained into the mid-5th c. CE, whose fortunes were closely tied to its trading connections and its salt production. Our excavations from 2014-2018 have identified the remains of an elite Roman domus, a tannery, a possible small bath, and a taberna, installed and then refurbished over five centuries. However, starting in the second half of the 5th c. CE, residents reoccupied the structures of Roman Salapia, while transforming the material characteristics to suit their needs. Rather than reading them as ruins, the skeleton of the Roman structures informed the organization of the community over time, encouraging the continued habitation of this coastal zone as a resource much like the salt still extracted from the lagoon landscape. Some still standing remains were fundamental perhaps to forming the foundation on which medieval castrum of Salpi was constructed, while those covered over were robbed to build the new town. In these ways, over the centuries, the inhabitants of this coast made and re-made materially and socially their communities.  Still today, the Monte di Salpi, an artificial "hill" that encapsulates the remains of the medieval town, provides a touchstone for the local community of Trinitapoli, the site of its earliest history and what it means to be a salinaro (inhabitant of the lagoon landscape). So our work, resurrecting these ruins and making the local community a fundamental part of this conversation, has made it clear that this is not a past "dead and gone", but rather, that the archaeological remains form part of a living legacy that brings Salapia into the 21st century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars, writers, poets, and an actress came together to celebrate poet Elizabeth Bishop's life in Brazil, from 1951 to 1966, and her journeys there in subsequent years, exploring her central relationship to the brilliant, self-taught landscape architect Lota de Macedo Soares who worked with Roberto Burle Marx on her own landmark modernist masterpiece home, Samambaia, in Petrópolis, as well as the celebrated Parque do Flamengo in Rio de Janeiro.

		<Abstract>As the nineteenth century drew to a close, white American psychiatrists declared that mental illness among African Americans in the South had reached alarming proportions and argued that, in a notable percentage of these cases, "religious excitement" was the key precipitating factor. This talk explores late nineteenth and early twentieth-century psychiatric theories about race, religion, and the "normal mind" and shows how the emerging specialty of psychiatry drew on works from history of religions to make racialized claims about African Americans' "traits of character, habit, and behavior." This history of the intersections of psychiatry and African American religions sheds light on how ideas about race, religion, and mental normalcy shaped African American experience in courts and mental hospitals and on the role the racialization of religion played more broadly in the history of medicine, legal history, and the history of disability.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Aztec art drew on the Mesoamerican past, citing works from the ancient cities of Teotihuacan and Tula to lend authority and legitimacy to the new empire.  But this engagement with the past also provoked reflection on the inevitable end of empire and the cyclicality of time, themes that resonate as the five hundredth anniversary of the Spanish invasion of Mexico unfolds this year.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many Aztec sculptures were carved on all available surfaces, including their undersides, such that some carvings would be concealed when the sculpture was set in place.   This practice raises questions about the meaning of Aztec image-making, the audiences for such concealed works, and how disciplines like art history should incorporate conditions of visibility into the study of ancient objects.  Most of the genres of Aztec art with carving on their undersides were archaizing, citing the sculptural traditions of cities like Teotihuacan and Tula, which had been abandoned centuries earlier.  In this talk, I consider the links between the Aztec experience of the past and the questions about the visibility of ancient sculpture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The American Civil War evokes images of white men, though we now sometimes acknowledge the participation of black soldiers, clashing in blue and gray uniforms on familiar battlegrounds:  Antietam, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga.  But there were other battlefields out west such as Honey Springs and Locust Grove and other people for whom this moment was a watershed.  The Civil War was not just a rupture between Northern and Southern states and Americans over the issue of slavery; other groups were drawn into the dispute.  Several American Indian nations, including the Choctaw Nation, officially sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War.  My talk will approach a familiar topic, the American Civil War, from a less familiar vantage point by focusing on the Choctaw Nation and the experience of Choctaw soldiers fighting for the Confederacy in particular.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A primary learning outcome in music theory courses is the ability to analyze musical form. To improve undergraduate music education, we have developed a combination of novel data pre-processing and user-directed pattern finding that make it possible to reach the full potential of Martin Wattenberg's 2001 vision for seeing the "Shape of Song" (http://www.bewitched.com/song.html). Through the ATAVizM course module, students create compelling visualizations to accompany their analytical papers, but more importantly they learn how analytical processes may be implemented as algorithms.  Musical themes and motives are often transposed or otherwise modified in the course of a piece. An example is the subject and answer of a fugue (an imitative polyphonic composition). How do we formalize the relationship between a subject and tonal answer? Or, the improvisational "licks" of Dizzy Gillespie? Such that we could define "themes" as a category that may be formalized computationally? Especially, when a computer does not know where to look for themes or what modifications to expect? We discuss how algorithms informed by humanistic understanding of music can work much better than those that are not.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In social histories of the Middle East, coffee and tea houses long constituted focal points in both artistic representation and  scholarly research.  These were not the only spaces of congregation  and interaction, however, just as caffeinated beverages were not the only drinks on tap. Often located in the more cosmopolitan  quarters of port cities, the tavern was also a vital site in the urban landscapes of Ottoman society. Featuring not only alcohol, many of these establishments also provided their patrons with food and with access to entertainment, recreation, and opportunities for fraternization with fellow citizens.  The tavern served not only as a locus for social gathering and drinking but it also served the state and its officials as a target for levying taxes and rent seeking, policing the empire's subjects and visitors, and enforcing regulation and/or prohibition. Dr. Evered's research draws on a broad range of primary sources to interrogate the place, purpose, and pertinence of the tavern in Ottoman cities.  It also informs and serves as a corrective to ongoing narrative manipulations of the country's diverse histories and traditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The treasury of the Studenica Monastery in southern Serbia preserves the only known Ottoman textile attributed to the fourteenth century, a massive silk hanging woven for Sultan Bayezid I. It was donated to the monastery in the very early 1400s by Bayezid's widow, Mileva Olivera Lazarevic (Despina Hatun). The textile's two inscriptions—al-Sultan al-calim al-cadil and Sultan Bayezid Khan cazza nasruhu—suggest it was commissioned for the Sultan himself. This talk argues, however, that the manner in which the inscriptions relate to the textile as a whole is at odds with their ostensible message. Rather than a custom design, this silk was probably a rush-job from a workshop accustomed to making goods for a commercial market. This talk introduces the textile, which has received little scholarly attention to date, putting its main features in context of its production as well as discussing its place at Studenica. It also argues for the importance of looking beyond text and evaluating evidence found in objects themselves.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What holds things together and pushes things apart when a community is under extreme duress--in my case, the duress of the violence of war and military blockade, with accompanying urban famine. I argue that Leningrad in 1941-1944 was in dire straits, and that centrifugal forces of opportunism, egoistic survival, and political (in)competence created possibilities for collapse. However, centripetal forces were sufficiently strong for collapse to be avoided. These centripetal forces included: sufficient elite coherence; local-level relations of empathy and dignity; and a sense of cohesion provided by the barbarity of the German assault itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This digitizing day was produced as part of the Mass. Memories Road Show is a statewide, event-based participatory archiving program that documents people, places, and events in Massachusetts history through family photographs and stories. Archivists and public historians at the Joseph P. Healey Library at UMass Boston collaborate with local planning teams and volunteers to organize free, public events where individuals bring photographs to be copied and included in a digital archive. Contributors are invited to describe the photographs in their own words. In addition, they may choose to share "the story behind the photos" on video, have their own "keepsake photo" taken, receive advice from professional archivists and historians on caring for their family photos, and learn from one another about the history of their community.  At this event, anyone connected to hip-hop in Massachusetts was invited to bring photographs, clothing, and other items that are important to them. Clothing and three-dimensional objects were photographed; audio and audiovisual materials were inventoried and arrangements were made to copy them after the event.  In addition, visitors participated in hip-hop trivia sessions and view a video program featuring documentary films about Boston hip-hop.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Befitting Leyla McCalla's family heritage, the multidisciplinary Breaking the Thermometer to Hide the Fever, commissioned and premiered by Duke Performances, amplifies source materials from the Radio Haiti Archive at Duke to lift up everyday voices of resistance and celebration in late-20th century Haiti. Collaborator and director Kiyoko McCrae, known for her devised theater work, weaves together original music, archival recordings, dance, and video projection to create an unparalleled theatrical experience. In commemoration, the piece arrives twenty years after the assassination of Jean Léopold Dominique, the owner and activist behind the independent, Kreyol-speaking station, Radio Haiti-Inter, whose legacy influences McCalla as she synthesizes and premieres this live performance that explores the complexities of what it means to be Haitian.  The performance debuted March 4, March 5, and March 6, 2020.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The oral tradition of French and Creole Louisiana is the result of a cultural brassage of numerous sources. Yet most undertakings in ethnology and folkloristics over the course of the 20th century have been limited to collection and linguistic studies with little regard for analysis of the this repertoire's content. Based on a more complete corpus that represents the the cultural diversity of the state, I aim to go beyond this monolithic understanding of the folk repertoire in order to better understand its adaptation to the sociocultural context of Louisiana.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An important conclusion of my recent research into the architecture of the temple of Hera at Olympia is that its stone colonnades are largely original to the building, and not, as formerly believed, the result of piecemeal repairs to an older wooden colonnade. The stone columns, as originals from the first quarter of the sixth century BCE, reveal a wide array of construction techniques that are only attested in distant places such as Aigina and Syracuse, as if expert masons had traveled to Olympia and collaborated on the construction of the Heraion. This case can be added to the extensive evidence for itinerant artisans and architects who were active elsewhere in Olympia during the seventh and sixth centuries BCE.  In this talk, I will review the archaeological evidence for inter-regional exchanges at Olympia and discuss why the sanctuary was such an important locus for the formation of archaic Greek art. The sanctuary seems to have balanced two contradictory forces in the development of archaic art: a universalizing push toward idealized forms of art and architecture that were rapidly disseminated throughout the Greek world, and a simultaneous expression of individual identity through the deliberate rejection of the pan-Hellenic norms in favor of regional ones. Archaeologists have tended to explain regionalism through what we know of the political history of Olympia in the early Archaic period—especially in terms of the conflicts among Elis, Pisatis, and Sparta—while downplaying the evidence for more complex interactions among individuals and groups from many other Greek centers. I will make the case that the quadrennial gatherings at the site by aristocrats from throughout the Greek world, and the general context of pan-Hellenic athletic competition, must have profoundly shaped and mediated the sorts of artistic and technical exchanges that connected Olympia to the Peloponnesian and western colonial Greek worlds.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through a serendipitous discovery six years ago, we came together to create a writing collaborative partnership that transformed how we work, how we feel about that work, and the directions that work has taken. Before joining forces, we had individual trajectories as a literary scholar of the nineteenth century and as a cognitive psychologist. Together we pursued a professional development opportunity to explore cross-disciplinary investigations of affect. We engage new areas of research not by building bridges to each other's areas of expertise but by working together from the ground up to create unique foundations of knowledge. This process is full of curiosity, awe, and discovery. In this talk we tell the story of how we came together, what we have been working on, why it matters, and where we are headed. It is a story about how a leap of faith can reinvigorate your teaching and how that energy can transform the direction of your scholarship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Questions about integration, of arts, humanities, STEM, medicine together, are shaped by discipline and context. Yet the overarching question that is central to the arts and humanities— what does it mean to be human?—invites scholars of all disciplines and fields into conversation. The humanities are crucial in responding to grand challenges because underlying any of these challenges are basic questions of who we are and how we ought to live. This panel discussion will explore questions about integration and ethos from vantage points in the humanities. What does reciprocity between arts, humanities, and STEMM mean? How can an integrative and ethical framing bring the humanities within reach of vulnerable populations? How can integrative approaches to humanities programs benefit general education, benefit graduate students? How might modern language study contribute to integration? After interactive discussion of these questions, the session will invite participants to practice a mapping exercise, a chance to converse and to do the hands-on work of designing connections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Alice Austen House fosters creative expression, explores personal identity, and educates and inspires the public through the interpretation of the photographs, life and historic home of pioneering American women photographer, Alice Austen (1866-1952). The Alice Austen House is the only museum in America dedicated to the work of a single female photographer. In June of 2017 the Alice Austen House marked its national designation as a site of LGBTQ history. The museum's listing on the National Register of Historic Places was amended to include LGBTQ history as an area of significance. This was an achievement of the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, funded through a grant from the New York State Historic Preservation Office and made possible by the National Park Service. Integrating Alice Austen and Gertrude Tate's loving relationship story into the museum's core interpretation bridges a gap between the institutional narrative of Austen's story and the truth that the LGBTQ community has long known about her life. While, in some ways, we are catching up, the Austen House is at the forefront of LGBTQ interpretation at historic sites. There are still few places that venture to address the LGBTQ stories of historical figures. LGBTQ history remains underrepresented in American history. This paper will explore the process of transformation funded by the National Endowment of the Humanities of this historic home to reinterpret and truthfully represent the life and work of Alice Austen to include LGBTQ+ histories in its permanent gallery spaces and public and educational programs. From scholar's research and planning through to implementation and outside partnerships, the Alice Austen House has begun to provide safe and inclusive programs for contemporary LGBTQ storytelling and continues to identify ways to enhance our social and historical responsibilities to the LGBTQ community.</Abstract>

27 June –29 June 2019
ALMS is a series of international conferences focused on public, private, academic, and grassroots archives collecting and preserving materials of all types from LGBTIQ+ communities. Its mission is to ensure that our history continues to be preserved and shared. The series was initiated in 2006 in Minnesota and the last two conferences took place in Amsterdam in 2012 and in London in 2016. These conferences provide an opportunity for archivists, activists and scholars from around the world to gather, share their stories and discuss the issues around documenting LGBTIQ+ lives. ALMS is an exceptional event as it offers the encouraging experience of being part of an international network overcoming borders and on track for the future.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>When the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture opened in the fall of 2016, it contained among its trove of displayed artifacts an object called Ashley's Sack (on loan from the Middleton Place Foundation of Charleston). Attributed to this object -- a plain cotton seed bag -- is a mysterious and dramatic history. The sack was bestowed as a gift by an enslaved black mother to her enslaved black daughter at the time of their separation through sale in antebellum South Carolina.  Embroidered with the narrative of this event by a descendant who inherited the item, the bag now functions as a record of slavery and story of family survival.  Ashley's Sack is at once a material object, archival source, and narrative text that sheds new light on black women's creativity, practicality, and perseverance. In addition, the object's use and transferal across time and place inspires reflection on the themes of slavery, love, loss, memory, testimony, and historical methods. This lecture will focus on the recovered seed sack and its meanings, with a focus on how we can employ the materiality of objects to access the interiority of enslaved women's lives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This workshop provides a series of new models—and a few old ones—for rejuvenating parish choirs and music ensembles, particularly for small or rural parishes with limited resources. Ideas and examples will be drawn from the English West Gallery tradition, contemporary British community gospel choirs, and from The InHarmony Report (2018) conducted by the rural Diocese of St. Edmundsbury and Ipswich (Suffolk, UK). Workshop attendees will be asked to make a joyful noise; tuneful singing is encouraged but not required.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the 1930s, Imperial Japan expanded into the Mongol territories of Northeast China, where nomadic herders lived on the steppe. Japanese planners, however, did not see seasonal migration as a rational use of resources, but rather, the root of overgrazing and degradation. As a result, they sought to eliminate nomadic features of herding. Japanese experimental farms began disseminating alien grasses and hybrid animals from Australia and North America whose intensive care demanded sedentary patterns of livelihood, undercutting nomadic practice over time. While the steppe would continue to look like the steppe, the resultant scientific stock-farming would also refigure an underlying ecology of transhumance into one of sedentary extraction for the Japanese empire.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The talk focused on the broad range of ways that Hindus in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu interact with their dead relatives. Within this ritual repertoire, Allocco's lecture highlighted ceremonies designed to invite the dead back into the world and install them in their family's home shrine as protective household or family deities. The goals of these invitation rituals, which have attracted little notice from anthropologists and other researchers, run counter to the dominant scholarly understanding of Hindu relationships with the departed, which draw on high-caste perspectives presented in Sanskrit texts that emphasize separation from the living</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For almost one hundred years the immense metropolis at Kerkenes in central Turkey has lain shrouded in mystery. Scholars have puzzled over this large pre-planned city apparently built and occupied by the Phrygians, of King Midas fame, for a brief period of time between the fall of the Assyrian Empire and rise of the Persian Empire around 550 BC. Over the past twenty-seven years, the site has been a showcase of new technologies being used alongside active excavation, useful in reconstructing the plan of the buried city and the activities and interactions of the people who inhabited it. Together, the latest excavations and technologies are shedding new light on what transpired in this ancient city in the years prior to its fiery destruction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This event served as one in a series of public design charrettes that allowed us to take a public collaborative approach to designing the public web interface for the project. Observing public interactions with beta versions of our software allowed us to gain understanding of users' needs and goals, and to iteratively develop and evaluate the designs . Each charrette included a process evaluation protocol consisting of close observation of charrette interactions, structured note-taking, and post-charrette debriefing sessions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1958 Father Busa presented his work in the IBM pavilion at the World's Fair in Brussels, Expo 58, the official motto of which was "A World View: A New Humanism." The ambiguities and entanglements behind that demo help us to understand the emergence of Busa's legendary Center, and shed light on at least one influential prehistory of today's digital humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The discoveries of Columbus focused attention on the newly discovered but barely known regions on the far side of the earth, a new zone of convergence where East and West met and crossed over into one another. It was now possible to think beyond the "inhabited world" known since Antiquity and to consider the earth in global terms, which is to say as a geometric object viewable from more than one side. The other side of the earth, where the New World formed the nearest part of an extended Asia, was now relayed to Europeans through a series of mediated images, almost immediately becoming a mirror for the European imagination. By considering several works of European sixteenth century art and literature, Alexander Nagel explores the dynamic reconfiguration of the world at a time when the imagination of globality was being framed explicitly as a problem of point of view, a problem that directly concerned practices of image-making and image-viewing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For over two centuries after 1492, Europeans saw the lands encountered across the Atlantic as Asian. They understood, described, and represented the Americas as Asia, not just for a decade or so, but up until 1650 and beyond. Our modern distinction between the two Indies is largely anachronistic for early modern people, who did not understand the world as divided in this way. Following this logic, this presentation examines how for Europeans in the sixteenth century, Mexico really was India, North America was an extension of China, and South America was populated by a variety of biblical and Asian sites. It will explore how for early modern Europeans, Asian and American, and sometimes African, toponyms, peoples, terrain, flora, fauna, atmospheres, and cultural productions mingled in the European consciousness, long after Columbus, even after the Pacific was being regularly traversed by European galleons, and even as prominent cartographers such as Ortelius and Mercator began to establish a four-continent model of the world.</Abstract>

		<ApplicationNumber>RZ-249862-16</ApplicationNumber>
		<Abstract>This presentation explores how for hundreds of years after the Columbian voyages, Europeans believed that Asia and America occupied the same continent. European cartographers and cosmographers understood the lands that are today the Americas to be near, or even overlapping with, China and India. Seemingly endless maps, narrative accounts, and images illustrate this phenomenon. Based on this idea, this talk focuses on the role of Marco Polo's Travels in constructing and reflecting such a worldview. It explores how a knowledge of and a trust in Polo's understanding of global geography was fundamental in undergirding the European understanding of America as Asia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation explores how for hundreds of years after the Columbian voyages, Europeans believed that Asia and America occupied the same continent. European cartographers and cosmographers understood the lands that are today the American Southwest and New Mexico to be near, or even overlapping with, China and India. Seemingly endless maps, narrative accounts, and images illustrate this phenomenon. This talk uses a variety of maps, images and historical texts to explore how and why early modern Europeans connected these two worlds. It shows how ideas about New Mexico were at the heart of the very earliest European conceptions of globalization.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In most accounts of the post-1492 discoveries, it is a foregone conclusion that an initial confusion with the continent of Asia steadily and even swiftly gives way to the realization that America was a New World. This talk explores how the newly discovered lands in Asia and America both delivered the shock of the new. Even the term "new world" was not a monopoly of America; the formulas mundus novus and novus orbis were also used to describe the lands reached by the Portuguese in Asia. Most importantly, the new realms discovered to the East and to the West were understood to be convergent. Using an abundance of sources from different media, our presentation explores the ways in which the idea of the New World was entirely compatible, for an extended period, with the idea that the newly discovered lands were part of Asia or bordered Asia. Our discussion will illuminate how a productive conjunction of Asia and the New World, what we call Amerasia, dominated the geographical imagination of Europe for over a century after 1492.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture explores the role of the scholar and translator in consecrating Ernest Hemingway for the Soviet literary market. Ivan Kashkin (1899-1963) was the leading translator of the American writer's work into Russian, as early as 1934, and published a two-volume edition of selected works in 1959. Specific attention will be given to Hemingway's introduction to the Soviet market in the 1930s; his exclusion from it after 1940 due to the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls; Kashkin's "re-reading" of Hemingway in the 1950s, and publication of the American author's Soviet biography in 1971.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the challenges for dance scholarship and education is its intangibility. In addition to dance notation, film and video are widely used as a form of dance "text," allowing for both preservation and analysis. While recording dance has become easier, significant barriers still prevent access to high-quality online dance resources. In May 2010, a working group led by University of Alabama faculty member, Rebecca Salzer, met to design a pilot online dance resource that fills this gap. This demonstration shares the group's design, which includes innovative dance scholarship and a pioneering approach to using digital space.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Improving the quality, discoverability, accessibility, and scope of online dance resources is essential to promoting equity and diversity within dance. This session reports on an NEH-funded Digital Humanities project with these goals. The project is focused on balancing thoughtful curation with inclusivity; broadening available resources beyond Eurocentric dance and imagining expansive future design and curation processes. A national group of women dance professionals are driving leadership of this initiative, spearheaded by Rebecca Salzer with a working group that is 83% female. We propose to share this project with Women in Dance Leadership, sparking interest, gathering feedback, and encouraging participation in shaping this new resource.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session reports on the progress of a working group that has drawn both feedback and members from NDEO 2017 and 2018.  Previous attendees made it clear that while digital video has made recording dance easier, high-quality, well-curated collections of full-length dance works are not available online and dance scholars and educators face significant geographical and financial barriers to access. In December 2018, the working group was awarded an NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant to fund a symposium at the University of Alabama, during which the group will design a pilot resource and draft a whitepaper. With the symposium scheduled for May 2019, we now propose to report to NDEO stakeholders on this new phase of the project and we seek feedback and involvement from NDEO members to help make the resource a reality.    Communication is central to our panel topic and to the mission of our project. Vibrant, dynamic, and accessible digital sharing of dance will open the door to an exchange of ideas both within the dance community and with audiences. It will also enrich the creative process, allowing educators to move beyond existing streaming dance video platforms that show only a minute or two of a 20- to 50-minute dance. These excerpts serve as publicity tools, but leave educators from primary grades to universities bereft: limited to teaching the equivalent of half a painting, the first minutes of a piece of music, or truncated sentences from a book. Access to full-length dance works will assist educators in teaching form and will allow dance-makers to convey a complete artistic gesture. Also integral to our project is an examination of how design and curation panels can balance thoughtful curation with inclusivity and open-access, broadening available resources beyond the Eurocentric dance to which existing online resources skew.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This panel brings together Gesel Mason, Norah Zuniga Shaw, and Rebecca Salzer, three innovators exploring the possibilities of dance in digital space, to discuss how we mobilize dance knowledge for the needs of this century.  Gesel Mason's solo performance project, NO BOUNDARIES: Dancing the Visions of Contemporary Black Choreographers, highlights the challenges of translating the live body in performance to a digital archive.  Ms. Mason will discuss this translation and how it affects our understanding of influential Black choreographers for whom the body and live performance are central.  Norah Zuniga Shaw is best known for Synchronous Objects, her award-winning collaboration with Maria Palazzi and William Forsythe acclaimed for shifting the paradigm of dance in digital space from one of preservation to one of expansion, circulation, and dynamic exchange of ideas between dance and other realms of thought and creation. Ms. Shaw will access her decades as creative director for a series of archive, dance data visualization, and choreographic scoring projects to pose the questions "what if?" and "what else?" Rebecca Salzer comes to these questions from twenty years as a screendance-maker.  Her work has been featured at national and international film festivals and on public television stations KQED-TV, KPBS-TV, and WTTW-TV. Ms. Salzer also serves as Project Director for the NEH-supported Dancing Digital Project, which works toward creating and facilitating more centralized, accessible, diverse, and forward-thinking dance resources online and will share Dancing Digital's findings and progress. An open discussion about overarching themes and questions will follow brief presentations by each panelist.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This panel provides a platform for discussion and feedback on the progress of a national project to improve the quality and accessibility of dance resources online.  The project seeks to address problems with dance's current online offerings, including fragmentation, lack of discoverability, financial and geographical barriers to access, lack of diversity and the predominance of excerpts rather than full length works.  Over the past two years, Rebecca Salzer and a working group presented this project to Dance/USA and NDEO and gathered feedback from artists, dance scholars, and educators. The group drafted a preliminary blueprint for a pilot resource that combines aggregation of existing online dance resources while providing new functionality for using dance works made available online.  The Dancing Digital discussion brings together dance scholars, educators, archivists, curators, and legal and systems design experts to imagine how online dance resources could better serve artistry, scholarship, and education in dance. The panel would like to share it's research findings around dance digital access with IABD participants, invite feedback on the project and connect with attendees interested in contributing to or participating in Dancing Digital's next steps.</Abstract>

We'll explore our local news history, starting with On Cue, a program aired on the first anniversary of KIRO-TV's inaugural broadcast on February 12, 1959. This "day in the life" of local television news is part of the KIRO-TV Special Programs videotape collection held by the UW Libraries, Special Collections. Following that, we'll share historical broadcast pieces from our participating institutions, including MOHAI, the Seattle Art Museum, Seattle Municipal Archives, the Wing Luke Museum and many more.  In an age when we are bombarded with multiple news stories and sources on a daily basis, it is important to reflect on our media history. Before Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, the Seattle area relied on KING, KIRO, KOMO, KCTS, and the Seattle Channel for their local television news. How we documented and described ourselves through broadcast reporting was (and continues to be) an essential part of how we formed our identity as a city and a community.  Television news has been called the first draft of history, but archival collections of local news broadcasts are scarce. Worldwide, more than 30 million hours of unique television programming are broadcast every year, yet only a tiny fraction of it is preserved for future reference, and only a fraction of that material is publicly accessible. Most television broadcasts are simply lost forever, though television archivists have been working diligently to preserve this important resource.  Television remains the most powerful medium in our culture, but we have almost no memory of it: broadcasts are ephemeral, and therefore difficult to analyze, fact-check, and evaluate. Publicly accessible television archives could transform television into a medium with a permanent history that is searchable, accessible, and therefore accountable.  Following the screening will be a Q&amp;amp;A session with MIPoPS.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This edition of Moving History will explore the endless varieties of activism present in local archives! Before the screening, there will be an introduction presented by Seattle Municipal Archives. Following the screening, we'll hold a Q&amp;amp;A session with MIPoPS staff and participating institution representatives.  In our current political climate, providing access to historic records is key to assisting the public in the quest for self-education and unbiased understanding of important events and policies. Protests, public speaking, community centered programs, art and performances, social justice, advocating for public spaces, giving a voice to the stories of marginalized groups, documenting histories of injustice, and promoting more environmentally sustainable and humane futures are just some examples of activism preserved in the audiovisual record. "Public archives…are making a strong effort to reach out to groups and collect materials whose provenance reflects the fullest possible range of social interests and actors. At the same time, social activists and public interest groups are recognizing the value of archiving their own materials, voices and stories for the sake of future generations." (archivalactivism.wordpress.com)  In recognition of the 20th Anniversary of the WTO Protests, this screening will include footage of activists in action from the Independent Media Center collection (recently digitized at MIPoPS). This material is from the 400 hours of video collected by the Seattle Independent Media Center during the 1999 WTO protests. In her article "Another Network is Possible," April Glaser describes the birth of the Independent Media Center: [full description too long for character limit]</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After the Second World War, the Soviet Union suppressed the memory of the Jewish massacre at Babi Yar and attempted to erase the site itself from the landscape. Critic and cultural historian Jeremy Eichler charts both the earliest attempts at forced amnesia as well as the highly fraught creation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, a ‘musical monument' that broke the official silence. The talk will also explore, more broadly, how certain works of music today carry forward the cultural memory of the wartime past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Analysis of King Tut's mummy shows he was sickly and frail, with numerous congenital birth defects, traumatic injuries, and diseases.  How different was he, the future king, from other individuals born in the same place and time?  The bioarchaeological study of the skeletal remains of non-elite individuals from the ancient Egyptian city of Akhetaten strives to answer this, and other questions, about the lives of the non-elites in Egypt during the Amarna Period (c. 1350BCE), a short 15-20 year period of possible upheaval during which the Pharaoh Akhenaten shifted the focus of the state religion from a pantheon of gods to a single solar deity, the Aten.  Akhenaten's new capital city, built to venerate the Aten in a place no other god had previously been worshiped was a thriving metropolis of 50,000 people.  The remains of this city represent the single best preserved site in Egypt that includes both settlement areas and cemeteries, allowing integration of multiple lines of evidence to understand more fully the lives of the non-elite, outside of the lens of written sources, which were often skewed toward the viewpoints and needs of the elites and royals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Hundreds of papyrus scrolls carbonized by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79 were recovered from the ancient Roman residence known today as the Villa dei Papiri. Containing mostly Greek philosophical texts, these fragile scrolls and their contents have fascinated scholars since their rediscovery in 1752. Classicists David Blank of UCLA and Richard Janko of the University of Michigan discuss early and current attempts to open the fragile layers and decipher their texts, and computer scientist W. Brent Seales of the University of Kentucky shares how advances in technology and machine learning might allow the still unopened ancient book rolls to be "virtually unwrapped" and read.  Reception to follow and galleries will be open until 8:00 p.m.  Support provided by the American Friends of Herculaneum Society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The UCLA/Getty Conservation Program presents "The man who can read the unreadable," computer scientist and professor W. Brent Seales, the first speaker in the 50th Anniversary Lecture Series. Currently a Getty Conservation Institute Scholar, Seales and his team have been key to revealing texts on papyri that are too fragile to unroll, such as Homers "Iliad" and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The recipient of a $2 million grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Seales will discuss how technological progress over the past ten years has led to the promise of "virtual unwrapping" for reading the "invisible library" of scrolls found at Herculaneum; papyri that were buried and burned in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 70 CE.  Reservations requested. Click here to RSVP by January 8. For more information call 310-825-4004.  Friends of the Cotsen Institute are invited to a private reception with Dr. Seales at 6pm. To learn more about the Friends visit their page or contact Michelle Jacobson at mjacobson@ioa.ucla.edu.  Seales is Professor and Chairman of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Kentucky. His research applies data science and computer vision to challenges in the digital restoration and visualization of antiquities. In 2012-13, he was a Google Visiting Scientist in Paris, where he continued work on the "virtual unwrapping" of the Herculaneum scrolls. In 2015, Seales and his research team identified the oldest known Hebrew copy of the book of Leviticus (other than the Dead Sea Scrolls), carbon dated to the third century C.E. The reading of the text from within the damaged scroll has been hailed as one of the most significant discoveries in biblical archaeology of the past decade.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ABSTRACT:  Progress over the past decade in the digitization and analysis of text found in cultural objects (inscriptions, manuscripts, scrolls) has led to new methods for reading the "invisible library".  This talk explains the development of non-invasive methods, showing results from restoration projects on Homeric manuscripts, Herculaneum material, and Dead Sea scrolls.  Premised on "virtual unwrapping" as an engine for discovery, the presentation culminates in a new approach – Reference-Amplified Computed Tomography (RACT) – where machine learning and cloud computing becomes a crucial part of the imaging pipeline.  This talk will explore the promise of virtual unwrapping and related applications, and will make the case that RACT may indeed be the pathway for rescuing still-readable text from some of the most stubbornly damaged materials, like the enigmatic Herculaneum scrolls.  BIO:  W.Brent Seales, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Kentucky, is currently a Getty Conservation Institute Scholar. Seales' research applies data science and computer vision to challenges in the digital restoration and visualization of antiquities. In the 2012-13 he was a Google Visiting Scientist in Paris, where he continued work on the "virtual unwrapping" of the Herculaneum scrolls. In 2015, Seales and his research team identified the oldest known Hebrew copy of the book of Leviticus (other than the Dead Sea Scrolls), carbon dated to the third century C.E. The reading of the text from within the damaged scroll has been hailed as one of the most significant discoveries in biblical archaeology of the past decade.

		<Abstract>"Until lions have historians, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter." Historian Danita Mason-Hogans advocates that the way we tell and document history is a social justice issue. She shares her family and community's multi-generation involvement in the civil rights movement, and how the importance of who tells a historical story and from who's perspective they are told, is as important as the story itself. Danita Mason-Hogans is a Civil Right Activist and Historian. Appointed by Mayor Pam Hemminger, she serves on the Chapel Hill Historic Rights Commemorations Task Force and works as Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies Program Manger for their critical oral histories component. Danita Mason-Hogans is the daughter of Dave Mason, who began the famous first sit-in of Chapel Hill's civil rights' movement, igniting decade of protests against segregation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For future art conservators, project-based training plays an important role in developing technical abilities and collaborative skills in the workplace. In an effort to help students gain this type of experience, the Conservation Center works proactively to arrange practical training opportunities over the summer recess. Students can join archaeological excavations such as Samothrace in Greece, and Selinunte in Sicily, or they may choose to work at museums, conservation facilities, and grand historic houses such as Villa La Pietra, NYU's estate in Florence, Italy. Tonight we will hear from conservation students about their recent summer internships in museum laboratories, libraries, archives, and private conservation studios. Please join us in the Loeb Room for refreshments at the conclusion of tonight's program.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Killebrew drew on her experience excavating and conducting research at sites in Egypt, Turkey and the Levant to portray the end of the Bronze Age in the region.  An expert in both the Bronze and Iron Ages, she discussed the archaeological evidence for the Golden Age (Homer's Iliad) and its collapse around 1200 BCE (Homer's Odyssey and biblical exodus). What caused this crisis:  climate change, migrations, social conflicts?  Why did some groups survive:  Philistines, Phoenicians, and early Israel?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The name La Pietra derives from a stone pillar indicating the Roman mile along Via Bolognese from the Florence city gate of San Gallo. For centuries, Villa La Pietra was home to many prominent Florentine families. In 1903, the Anglo-American Acton family took up residence in the 600 year old estate. When Arthur Acton and his wife Hortense Mitchell settled in La Pietra, they and their two children, Harold and William, became immersed in a society of writers, historians, artists, and art collectors. The Acton's own art collection comprises more than 6,000 objects ranging in date from the Etruscan period to the early 20th Century. Fine art exists alongside household objects, books, textiles, furniture, and souvenirs. A library of 10,000 volumes with many signed first editions, an archive holding thousands of family letters, an important series of historical photographs, Hortense's many Callot Soeurs gowns, and an extensive outdoor sculpture collection are but a few of the many treasures found at the Villa. To perpetuate their legacy, the Actons decided to leave La Pietra to a university with the expertise and vision to care for and benefit from their estate. So it was in 1994 that Sir Harold Acton bequeathed his family's estate to New York University. Over the next two decades and through collaboration with the Villa's Italian administration—inlcuding Francesca Baldry, Collection Manager; Ellyn Toscano, Director; and numerous conservation consultants here in the U.S.—our students assist in the conservation efforts of this revealing palimpsest of an ex-pat family. Tonight, conservation students will present their 2018 spring break and summer work projects at Villa La Pietra, New York University's global campus in Florence. Please join us in the Loeb Room for refreshments at the conclusion of tonight's program.</Abstract>

	</Presentation>
	<Presentation ID="16831">
		<ApplicationNumber>PR-234235-16</ApplicationNumber>
		<Abstract>Digital data has grown in prominence across the humanities, social sciences and archaeology. Our experience with Open Context (http://opencontext.org), an open access data publishing service for archaeology, shows that preserving, communicating, aggregating and reusing digital data all involve significant intellectual challenges and opportunities. While our profession increasingly recognizes these possibilities, we rarely discuss the professional context that shapes the "datafication" of our discipline. Our current institutional landscape increasingly demands the commoditization, marketing, and branding of scholarship. However, meaningful digital engagement requires greater professional recognition for the process and ethical conduct of research - rather than rewarding only the efficient production of measurable research outcomes. The term "Slow Data" helps to encapsulate this need, and the need for longer term institutional support in better situating data in archaeological practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the era of Data Analytics and "Big Data", what role does the study of underresourced language data play? This paper outlines data curation issues for a smaller language data set from the Egyptian language during the Roman era. Some of the principles developed while curating new "small data" resources can, and arguably should, be translated to "big data", as well.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Professor Gölönü looks at the relationship between cultural heritage practices and artistic output in the transition from the late Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic.  She focuses on photographic albums, paintings, and commentaries commissioned by the 19th C. Ottoman ruler Abdulhamid II, to document early Ottoman settlements, history, and culture.  She explores connections between late Ottoman artistic development and the canonization of art history.   She discusses how folkloric practices, motifs, and narratives then combined with modernist aesthetics in the works of the artists of the 1930s and 1940s in Turkey and the interplay of a "nativized" cultural identity with a nationalist art history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Greek drama originated at the Dionysia in Athens in the late 6th century BCE, but spread widely across the Greek-speaking world during the 4th century BCE. In the 3rd century BCE, new associations of musicians, poets, and actors, the Technitai of Dionysus, formed, and quickly became a powerful force at the festivals, negotiating with cities and rulers in the interests of their members. Performers, benefactors, spectators, and the buyers and sellers who crowded festival markets all had something to gain from their participation in these cultural events. This talk concerns the history of the Greek dramatic festivals in Roman Asia Minor, from the second century BCE through the collapse of the festivals in Late Antiquity, exploring the long-lived vitality of the festivals in Asia Minor, the unique evidence that comes from this region, and the social, economic, and political forces which shaped the institutions which supported the performance of drama for so many hundreds of years.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation introduced the many ways in which song and sound, food and taste interacted with iconography and architecture at Abbot Suger's Gothic church of Saint-Denis in the twelfth century. I demonstrated several ways in which Abbot Suger invoked the different senses to further the monastic work of commemoration. These included the refurbishment of the church's central liturgical core and the rebuilding of the monks' refectory; the introduction of weekly commemorations for Saint Denis and the Virgin, and the reestablishment of other commemorations for royal benefactors—all tied to Suger's own memory and celebrated with special liturgies and meals; and inscriptions and iconography linking food and music in stone, stained glass, and other liturgical furnishings and objects. Beyond the stunning architectural and visual innovation for which it is known, Suger's church served as a multi-sensory memory palace and as a stage for the miraculous, where monks, abbots, and kings might hope for a place at the heavenly feast.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We will explore major issues and debates in the global history of medicine and public health, with a case study of the U.S. colonial government's anti-leprosy campaign in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. We will examine two controversial and highly contested issues: criminalization of disease, and tensions between individual rights and the protection of public health through forced isolation and confinement. These issues remain relevant today as seen in the criminalization of HIV/AIDS, and the imposition of travel restrictions and quarantines in cases related to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, and the COVID-19.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation explores the data that underpins Mapping the Scottish Reformation, a project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities that traces the careers of Scottish clergymen between the Reformation of 1560 and the Glorious Revolution of 1689.  At first glance, the Church of Scotland's meticulous records present an image of a rigid structure consistent over time and space that would ideally suit a digital approach. However, our period was one of dramatic shifts and regional diversity. Ecclesiastical policy was hotly debated; parishes were created, dissolved, or united with each other; and ministers' roles changed, from mere exhorter to preacher of God's word. This presentation discusses how Mapping the Scottish Reformation seeks to capture this data while remaining sensitive to messiness of clerical experiences during the pivotal post-Reformation era.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Islamicate world is renowned for its numerous public and private libraries, expression of an overall book culture that seems to aptly characterize large segments of Near and Middle Eastern societies beyond denominational borders throughout time. While some libraries have completely vanished, others can partly be reconstructed on the basis of the dispersed codices and/or data provided in secondary historical sources. Since much of Yemen's manuscript tradition has come down to us, the preserved material allows for a meticulous longue durée study of Yemen's religio-cultural history through its libraries, the outlines of which will be sketched out in the lecture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1960, 180,000 people lived in Gary, Indiana, a thriving industrial city. Fifty years later, only 80,000 people lived there. Why? What happened? And where did residents go?   Flight Paths, a 90-minute interactive workshop, weaves together oral histories from residents of Northwest Indiana and places them alongside historical contexts to document the changing racial and economic demographics of Gary and the region, including the rise of black political power and opportunity in the 1960s and '70s, the "flight" of white residents and businesses to the suburbs, and the automation and subsequent underemployment of the steel mills.   Our basis of presentation will be the prototype for our interactive documentary website. Participants will "visit" the site together, "tour" the Tolleston neighborhood, and discuss their experiences collectively and in small groups.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the domains of religious, social, or literary studies, texts are now less seen as abstract vehicles of meaning encoded in language, and they are rather considered within the multiple dimensions that led to their production and consumption. What surrounds the text contributes to regiment its meaning and language alone is not enough to turn a text into a source or an object of aesthetic inquiry. With this panel we will discuss the renewed interest in the material and performative dimensions of the study of textual practices in South Asia. We will use as points of entry two recent publications: the volume Text and Tradition in Early Modern North India (OUP 2018), co-edited by Tyler Williams, Anshu Malhotra, and John Stratton Hawley, and Thibaut d'Hubert's In the Shade of the Golden Palace: Alaol and Middle Bengali Poetics in Arakan (OUP 2018). Tyler Williams and Thibaut d'Hubert will also introduce their respective book projects, which both address topics related to the history of vernacular literacy in early modern North India.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>It is usually assumed that the medieval and early modern religious saints associated with 'bhakti' religiosity were illiterate and their songs and sayings circulated in oral form for decades or even centuries before being committed to writing. But is this true? This talk will present new evidence and new arguments to assert that these saints-- at least those that composed in Hindi--were either literate or composed in literate social contexts and that their compositions circulated in written form from early on in their histories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Metropolitan Science Project aims to, "consider alternative locations and institutional contexts for the construction of science, and this lecture considers these alternative locations and institutional contexts, namely artisanal workshops embedded within the city of Toulouse. I argue that in these workshops, as well as in how-to recipe texts, "making is knowing." I also wish to point out that that cities fostered an interest in and a culture of practical knowledge, particularly those cities with large immigrant populations of artisans and practitioners, those with resident courts of governing nobles, or with concentrations of entrepreneurial printers. These all were spaces of vibrant knowledge production in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During 2018-2019, the focus was on "First Forays into Florida," the free public event associated with the grant, held in University Center Lobby and Auditorium on 21 February, 2019. The theme and subtitle of this well-attended event was "What did they see that wasn't there?" for Florida has always been a "State of Dreams" for the Europeans who hyped, conquered, exploited, and marveled at it.   At the event, Jerald T. Milanich returned to give a talk entitled "Women in Spanish Moss Sarongs and Alligators with Ears: Theodore de Bry's Famed 1591 Engravings of Florida Indians." Milanich pursued and solved "a 420-year old mystery involving Sit Walter Raleigh, English investors, a dead French artist, a live English artist, the lost Roanoke colony, two French noblemen (one murdered, the other deceased), and ancient Picts from Britain, all played out across two continents."   Dr. Maurice ("Socky") O'Sullivan of Rollins College gave a talk titled "Have You Not Hard of Floryda? Early Spanish, French, Portuguese, English, and Latin Accounts of Florida." Hype and reality intertwined in the early colonial literatures O'Sullivan discussed; which included the first poem printed in English, published the year Shakespeare was born, "Have You Not Hard of Floryda?"   Finally, Carol Mahler, seminar participant, archivist and professional storyteller, gave her interpretations of tales from Florida Seminoles and cowhunters. (It has to be said that she was the favorite of the students present.)   In the auditorium lobby, posters from faculty and students showcased their research projects; the Avon Park and Sebring Historical Societies brought their displays, and art instructor Karla Respress and her students demonstrated, by means of a video, their contemporary version of Florida indigenous people's techniques of pottery firing, with examples on display. Students from the SFSC Honors Program assisted with the program and served refreshments before and after.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The production of medical knowledge and the practice of medicine historically were seen as positivist pursuits in which authoritative figures made objective discoveries and applied them dispassionately to their patients. This mirrored widespread beliefs about the sciences in general. Increasingly, however, historians have come to understand medicine as a socially-constructed human behavior that is not purely objective in process or experience. In short, a more subjective view.  In a diverse society such as the United States, questions of who produces medical knowledge and to whom it is applied yield answers as myriad as the complex demography of America itself. And, is medicine something that only "comes from" a doctor, or is it something that is practiced in the home by patients and their family members? In this lecture, we'll explore how the production of, attitudes about, and outcomes from medicine have changed over time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For as long as women have battled for equitable political representation in America, those battles have been defined by images.  Join us for a discussion with Allison K. Lange about her new book, Picturing Political Power: Images in the Women's Suffrage Movement. Historians and American Girls podcast hosts Allison Horrocks and Mary Mahoney will lead a Q&amp;amp;A with our burning questions about women's voting rights.  Why is Susan B. Anthony one of the most famous female activists in US history? Did Americans really think that suffragists were as masculine and aggressive as anti-suffrage cartoons suggested? And, a century later, what is the legacy of these visual debates about gender and power?  At the end, we'll invite you to propose your own questions!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>- Allison K. Lange, Wentworth Institute of Technology, in conversation with Catherine Allgor, MHS  Picturing Political Power offers a comprehensive analysis of the connection between images, gender, and power. This examination of the fights that led to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment explores how suffragists pioneered one of the first extensive visual campaigns in modern American history. Prof. Allison Lange shows how pictures, from early engravings and photographs to colorful posters, proved central to suffragists' efforts to change expectations for women, fighting back against the accepted norms of their times. Picturing Political Power demonstrates the centrality of visual politics to American women's campaigns throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, revealing the power of images to change history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>the ANS's first Money Talks (lecture series) of 2019, featured an introduction to Hellenistic Greek coinage and a good look at arguably some of most beautiful coins in the collection. Touching on some of the current problems in Hellenistic numismatics and scholarship, Dr. van Alfen will used the ANS's resources—online with Hellenistic Royal Coinages and in print with the new Coins of the Ptolemaic Empire— to help participants gain a better understanding of Hellenistic Greek coinages.

		<Abstract>The noninvasive digital restoration of ancient texts written in carbon black ink and hidden inside artifacts has proven elusive, even with advanced imaging techniques like X-ray-based micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). This work identifies a crucial mistaken assumption: that micro-CT data fails to capture any information representing the presence of carbon ink. We demonstrate a new computational approach that captures, enhances, and makes visible the characteristic signature created by carbon ink in micro-CT. This previously "unseen" evidence of carbon inks, which can now successfully be made visible, can lead to the noninvasive digital recovery of the lost texts of Herculaneum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Veterans Week webinar, part of the University of Missouri - St. Louis Center for the Humanities Digital Humanities lecture series, funded by the Missouri Arts Council  Prof. Gitre will talk about a Virginia Tech-based NEH-funded interdisciplinary digital initiative that is harnessing the power of "the crowd" and artificial intelligence to provide public access to a unique historical collection—65,000 pages of uncensored reflections on war and military service from American soldiers, in their own words. The project began as a digital humanities classroom experiment in 2015. Hosted on the planet's largest crowdsourcing platform, Zooniverse.org, The American Soldier in World War II has since now attracted thousands of other "citizen archivist" volunteers from around the globe, breaking down the wall between the classroom and public square.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Museums, libraries, and web sites celebrate the names of Philippe Sichel, Siegfried Bing, and Hayashi Tadamasa as "great dealers of Japanese art" and present them as the pioneers of the nascent Japan trade in France. In contrast, the names of Louise Chopin Desoye, Marie Antoinette Schlotterer Malinet, and Florine Ebstein Langweil have been largely lost to history, even when they informed and complemented the work of these better-known men. This lecture uses newly discovered archival material to emphasize the participation of women in the nineteenth-century Paris market for Japanese antiquities.

		<Abstract>The Paris Musée d'Ennery owes its existence to a young woman who, in the 1840s, had an interest in acquiring the Chinese and Japanese "monsters" hidden in antique shops. Fifty years later, Clémence Lecarpentier d'Ennery bequeathed her collection of nearly 7,000 objects to the French state. Although she assembled these pieces and built a house and galleries to curate and display them, museum conservators posthumously erased her life's work, presenting it instead as her husband's achievement.  This illustrated talk will present the museum, its collections and its history before teasing out some of the complicated social factors—among them class, gender, religion and nationalism—that led to the museum's marginalization as a cultural institution.</Abstract>

Through performance and discussion with storyteller Lyn Ford, author and community scholar Wayne Winkler, and Anthony Mayle, Assistant Director, Marietta College Office of Diversity and Inclusion, we will examine the unique development of multiple racial identities and challenge the story of Appalachian monoculturalism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A Bayesian mind is, at its core, a rational mind. Bayesianism is thus well-suited to predict and explain mental processes that best exemplify our ability to be rational. However, evidence from belief acquisition and change appears to show that we don't acquire and update information in a Bayesian way. Instead, the principles of belief acquisition and updating seem grounded in maintaining a psychological immune system rather than in approximating a Bayesian processor.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Prior to the Cavendish renaissance, Margaret Cavendish—like virtually all early modern women—was excluded from the academic study and teaching of English literature, despite her groundbreaking role as an author and natural philosopher. This systematic erasure has its origins in pedagogical practices developed around the teaching of a canon of male authors and notions of authorship. By gaining a better understanding of this especially bold and productive female author, we also gain insight into problems with equity and representation within higher education. To this end, this panel brings you the paradigm shifting work of Sarah Connell, whose dedication to the Women Writers Online Project (https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/) has significantly expanded access to early women writers; and the careful bibliographic and digitization efforts of Liza Blake, whose Margaret Cavendish's Poems and Fancies, A digital critical edition (http://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/poemsandfancies/) offers the first fully collated and digitized edition of a Cavendish text.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using the Women Writers Project as an exemplar, this paper will discuss methods for conducting exploratory research with digital collections and, in particular, for identifying research possibilities that may not have been anticipated by a collection's original developers. The talk will examine several methods of digital scholarship—including text encoding, data visualization, text analysis at scale, and XML-based transformations—and consider best practices for accessing the rich layers of information available in many digital collections. The paper will conclude with some thoughts on how developers and curators can build collections that will support a broad range of use cases.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This lecture explores the literary and physical dimensions of the interrelated processes of the memorialization of Sufi figures, specifically how textual and oral traditions about Sufi saints overlap and intersect and are formed and re-formed over time, and the associated transformation of saints' burial places (real or imagined) into shrines, forming shrinescapes that incorporate a combination of Islami and mythic motifs. To explore these questions I employ a case study of Khoja I?haq Khuttalani (d. 1423), a disciple of Mir Sayyid ?Ali Hamadani, who traveled to Badakhshan in present-day Tajikistan.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Chassica Kirchhoff has given two virtual lectures inspired by what she has learned about our armor collection during this NEH SCHC project. The first was a "Lunch and Learn" on Thursday, June 11, 2020 given for Associate level members and above, which focused on armor represented in the DIA collection including sculptures, paintings, prints and armor. The second one, Magnificence in Steel, was on Saturday, September 26 for the Visiting Committee for European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, one of the DIA supporting Auxiliaries. Its focused was the specific discoveries Dr. Kirchhoff made while examining and studying the armor from the estate of William Randolph Hearst. The NEH SCHC grant was acknowledged during the lecture, as these examinations would not have taken place without this grant. Dr. Kirchhoff also compiled a document that provides an overview of specialized cataloging needs for arms and armors. The new standards marry our DIA cataloging and data entry protocols with best practices developed by important arms and armor repositories like The MET and the UK Royal Armouries (see attached).</Abstract>

Tim Troll will first share a brief film, Bristol Bay Remembers:  The Great Flu of 1919, and photographs from the U.S. Revenue Cutter Unalga that responded first in Unalaska and later in Bristol Bay.  From there, Katie Ringsmuth will discuss how Bristol Bay was the last manifestation of the Spanish influenza outbreak in Alaska.  Her presentation will share the story of how salmon canneries on the Naknek River responded to the pandemic while local communities, hit hard by the disease, survived to give birth to Bristol Bay's future generations.  She will also share a sneak peek of the Mug Up exhibition, slated to open at the Alaska State Museum in 2002.  This is the first talk in the Cook Inlet Historical Society's 2020-2021 Speaker Series, "Disasters."  All presentations will be free and open to the public; advance registration is required to receive the link via Zoom.  In addition to teaching US and Alaska History at the University of Alaska Anchorage, Dr. Katie Ringsmuth is the founder of Tundra Vision and the director of the NN Cannery History Project, which, in collaboration with the Alaska State Museum, is developing the exhibition Mug Up:  The Language of Work, the first museum exhibition to tell the story of Alaska's salmon canneries through the perspective of the diverse cannery community.  Tim Troll came to Alaska as a VISTA volunteer lawyer in 1978.  He is currently executive director of the Bristol Bay Heritage Land Trust, an organization he helped found in 2000.  The Trust has conserved 36,000 acres of salmon habitat in Bristol Bay.  The Trust is also a sponsor of the NN Cannery History Project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sufisms in North Africa are both esoteric and exoteric; that is, they harbor hidden forms of knowledge and experience known only to initiates but perform them regularly in rituals that are public or semi-public, making them accessible to all. When musics of these rituals are brought onto the concert stage, then, they pose analytical challenges to binaries such as spectatorship/participation, loss/renewal, and authenticity/inauthenticity. In Tunisia, the staging of Sufi music has been monopolized for decades by a staged spectacle called el-Hadhra, which, along with its offshoots and competitors, proceeds according to a modular logic of culture in which music, dance, trance, and other aspects of ritual are approached as separable, extractable, and available for recombination in a plug-and-play manner. This paper unpacks the implications of this logic of modularity through a close reading of el-Hadhra that focuses on strategies of minimizing and maximizing the ‘contextual gap' between ritual and stage performances. The resulting ambiguities, I argue, are inextricable from changing social, religious, and political chains of value ascribed to Sufism over the past century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 1918 "Spanish" flu pandemic killed 50-100 million people within 18 months. Drawing on over 600 eyewitness testimonies of the pandemic in its European context, Prof. Eicher will discuss how average Europeans responded to the 1918 flu--how they died, what they felt, and who they blamed--and compare their reactions to modern Europeans during the COVID-19 pandemic.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For more than 20 years, Professor Brent Seales has worked to digitally restore the most damaged, inaccessible, and venerated cultural heritage objects in the world. In this talk, he and his team will present an overview of their current project to virtually unwrap and read the Herculaneum scrolls and other unopenable texts. The team will cover (1) the important role of data science, (2) the use of photogrammetry to create 3D models of open papryi fragments, (3) the development of a machine learning tool to identify the ink used in the Herculaneum scrolls; (4) the computer scientist's role in establishing the integrity of digital objects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The team presents an overview of the history and future of their "virtual unwrapping" work. The talk includes:  A description of early experiments and the success with reading the scroll from En Gedi: A discussion of all the different kinds of material damage and the need to address open, closed, and other form factors. Discussion of recent work to incorporate photogrammetry in the process.  Discussion of how we are using open and closed fragments + ML/AI as a way to read inside damaged scrolls. Discussion of the importance of metadata and a digital provenance data chain.  Description of a broader view of the Invisible Library and a look-ahead to current and future projects (Morgan M.910, Dead Sea Scroll fragments, and ancient book bindings).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Progress over the past decade in the digitization and analysis of text found in cultural objects (inscriptions, manuscripts, scrolls) has led to new methods for reading the "invisible library".  This talk explains the development of non-invasive methods, showing results from restoration projects on Homeric manuscripts, Herculaneum material, and Dead Sea scrolls.  Premised on "virtual unwrapping" as an engine for discovery, the presentation culminates in a new approach that may indeed be the pathway for rescuing still-readable text from some of the most stubbornly damaged materials, like the enigmatic Herculaneum scrolls.</Abstract>

	</Presentation>
	<Presentation ID="18458">
		<ApplicationNumber>HAA-263850-19</ApplicationNumber>
		<Abstract>Damaged artifacts that contain text make up an "invisible library" of written material that is incredibly difficult to read.  But progress over the past decade using new computer techniques for the digitization and analysis of text found in cultural objects (inscriptions, manuscripts, scrolls) has led to workable, non-invasive methods for reading this invisible library.  This talk shows results over the past two decades from digital restoration projects on Homeric manuscripts, Herculaneum material, and Dead Sea scrolls, culminating in the reading of the text from within a damaged scroll unearthed at En-Gedi, which has been hailed as one of the most significant discoveries in biblical archaeology of the past decade.  Premised on "virtual unwrapping" as an engine for discovery, this presentation explains the complete process developed for reading the scroll from En-Gedi, and the broader significance of the discovery.  The talk concludes by unveiling a new approach – Reference-Amplified Computed Tomography (RACT) – where machine learning becomes a crucial part of the digital restoration pipeline. You will leave this talk considering that RACT may indeed be the pathway for rescuing still-readable text from some of the most stubbornly damaged materials, like the enigmatic Herculaneum scrolls.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the 1970s Black women writers began gathering in Brooklyn and Manhattan, forming themselves into a group who came to be informally known as The Sisterhood. Uplifting each others' lives and honing their craft, they were central to an explosion of 1970s and 1980s literature that included for colored girls who have considered a suicide when the rainbow is enuf. On social media, the photo of these future literary legends, including Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, June Jordan, Patricia Spears Jones, Margo Jefferson, and Ntozake Shange, among many others, is iconic. Join our invited writers for a discussion of Shange's place in the Sisterhood and other collectives. Where does literary organizing fit into histories of Black feminist activism? What lessons can these earlier groups offer young people today about organizing and cultivating artistic communities? And how can they claim space for radical voices?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After the era of the Indian New Deal with the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Indian country and the nation moved into the Termination and Relocation era after World War II, a time when federal policy attempted to remove Indians from their homelands and forcibly assimilate them by moving them to cities.  Many Crows were moved to urban centers from Cleveland to California.  There were some good and more bad experiences, but most Crows demonstrated their cultural independence and their own group values of family and tribe by returning home to Crow Country.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Natural thermal springs dot the Tuscan landscape. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany encouraged the use of these thermal waters as medical treatments and supported physicians who prescribed water cures and studied the mineral composition of the waters. This talk will explore the impact of Medici patronage on the development of chemistry and medical care in early modern Tuscany. By using patient stories gleaned from archival and medical documents, this talk will also discuss the challenges of conducting historical research and the effect digitization has had on methodology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this session, Santa Fe College language professors, Eva Casanas and Marcela Murillo, along with SF philosophy professor, Ann Thebaut, will each share their innovative pedagogical strategies for educating students on the cultural and ethical significance of food and sustainability.  Eva and Marcela will discuss how, through research and creation of posters focused on foods from different cultures, SF students of Spanish and Chinese learned not only about food production and consumption, but also about the cultural significance of food.  Ann will describe how ethical issues of food and sustainability were considered in the context of a thought-provoking, fast-paced ethics improv competition--a "Sustainability Slam."  Audience members should find this to be a fun and engaging session!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Golonu discussed the production of leisure space by looking at selections of Ottoman and Turkish Republican postcard imagery held in the Duke Libraries.  Golonu is currently working on a book project on Ottoman sites of leisure referred to as public gardens or "people's gardens," which were modeled after European-style urban parks. Golonu will look at how these gardens replaced older sites of leisure in Thessaloniki and Istanbul, and contextualize their imagery with Ottoman novels, newspaper columns, or memoirs of the day.  As public, semi-public and social spaces, such gardens can be viewed as a symptom and cause of the modernizing changes remaking Ottoman society during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The search for the Philistines, best known as one of ancient Israel's most storied enemies, has long intrigued both scholars and the public. Recent archaeological and textual evidence, examined in its broader eastern Mediterranean context, reveals that the Philistines, together with other related groups of "Sea Peoples" best known from Egyptian New Kingdom texts, played a transformative role in the development of new ethnic groups and polities that emerged from the ruins of the Late Bronze Age empires. This lecture reassesses the origins, identity, material culture, and the impact of the Philistines and other "Sea Peoples" on the Iron Age cultures and peoples of the eastern Mediterranean.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project investigates how artists used vivid visual allegories of Christ's broken body in the Eucharist as a means to conceptualize and represent ecumenical union: the aspiration to unite Christian peoples worldwide into one, undivided, universal Church. The protagonist of the project is a well-known Byzantine micromosaic icon of Christ the Man of Sorrows, enshrined since ca. 1400 at the Basilica di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome. Crafted from nearly 50,000 minute pieces of glass, metal, marble, and stone, the icon is among the most meticulous depictions of the human body in medieval art. The story of this icon, which journeyed from Constantinople to Rome via the Kingdom of Naples and other Mediterranean ports-of-call, affords new insight into the metaphorical meaning of Christ's broken body in both Orthodox and Latin/Catholic ritual contexts at a critical juncture in the political conflict between the divided Churches of East and West. Enshrined in Rome in an extraordinary triptych reliquary cabinet and ensconced by relics representing all corners of medieval Christendom, the icon became the centerpiece to a grand microcosm of the Christian oecumene: "the known world." Ultimately, the project showcases the roles of art and allegory in creating a new, global vision for the Church at the close of the Middle Ages––a mosaic made up of diverse parts, united in a cohesive, ecclesiological body.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Almost every Greek tragedy features a wound. Oedipus' gouged-out eyes are among the most memorable, but there are many other varieties: combat wounds, animal bites, and even emotional wounds. This last type of trauma dominates the events of Sophocles' Women of Trachis, which dramatizes the connection between Deianeira's emotional pain and the physical pain of her husband, Heracles. Over the course of the play, Deianeira narrates the chronic pain and anxiety she feels during Heracles' cyclical absences, as well as a past incident of sexual violence that continues to affect her even many years later. Drawing on modern trauma research, this talk argues that Sophocles' Women of Trachis depicts the struggle of putting words to these types of emotional wounds.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1803, in the wake of Edward Jenner's discovery that cowpox provided safe and reliable immunity against smallpox, the Spanish Crown began an enthusiastic vaccination campaign, opening vaccination rooms on the peninsula and allowing Dr. Francisco Xavier Balmis y Berenguer to sail around the world, bringing the vaccine to the diverse populations of the Spanish Empire.  However, from the outset vaccination met with serious opposition as it challenged race and gender hierarchies, provoked anxieties about outside invention in children's health, and rejected the cultural belief that mothers could effectively care for their own children. In Peru, mothers called the primary vaccinator "the AntiChrist" and fled to the mountains rather than vaccinate their children, and in central Mexico, indigenous mothers brought their children to be vaccinated but then asked for the "poison" to be removed. Poska will examine the varieties of opposition to some of the earliest efforts at smallpox vaccination, discuss how Balmis and other authorities attempted to overcome that opposition, and consider how those early anti-vaxxers provide insight into the race and class-based opposition to vaccination today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1966 to 1968, the United States government commissioned Diné (Navajo) artists Bertha and Fred Stevens to demonstrate weaving and sandpainting across Eurasia and Latin America, ostensibly as an exercise of Cold War "soft power." Drawing upon Indigenous knowledge, International Relations theory, and the methods of ecocritical art history, Jessica Horton reframes the Stevens' tour as a creative instance of what?she?calls "earth diplomacy." This talk presents one strand of her current book project,?Earth Diplomacy: Indigenous American Art and?Reciprocity, 1953–1973, which examines how artists revitalized longstanding Indigenous cultures of diplomacy in the unlikely shape of Cold War tours, translating Native political ecologies across two decades and four continents.</Abstract>
