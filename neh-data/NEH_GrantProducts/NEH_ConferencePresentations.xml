		<Abstract>In classical studies, the association of words and places has centered on textual references.  Researchers have scoured through epigrams, letters, histories and other written sources seeking descriptive passages about spaces, buildings, streets, landscapes, and cities.  Yet words literally occupied places.  Thousands of inscriptions embellished and informed Roman environments, though they are usually studied ripped from their original contexts.  The Visualizing Statues in the Late Antique Roman Forum project created at UCLA with support from the NEH, interrogates how the placement of inscriptions in the center of Rome as well as their content is essential to understanding their meaning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The GeoHistorian Project is an initiative from Kent State University's Research Center for Educational Technology (RCET), aimed at educating K-12 students to become local historians, reducing the barriers between schools and community resources, giving students opportunities to create mobile digital content for their community, and investigating the potential of mobile tools for learning in informal settings. Currently in its first year, the project provides teachers with interdisciplinary curriculum and associated professional development. Student-created digital and local historical content will be available online and freely accessible by way of QR codes (two-dimensional bar codes) that will be placed in relevant community locations and can be scanned with wireless mobile devices. This session will provide an overview of the GeoHistorian Project, including curriculum examples and some preliminary student-produced digital content.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Why did the Victorians look to mathematics to achieve certainty, and how we might understand the Victorians better with the mathematical methods they bequeathed to us? I want to relate the Victorian debate about the foundations of our knowledge to a debate that we are likely to have in the coming decade, a debate about how we know the past and how we look at the written record that I suspect will be of interest to literary scholars and historians alike. It is a philosophical debate about idealism, empiricism, induction, and deduction, but also a practical discussion about the methodologies we have used for generations in the academy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We present the beginnings of a new system for optical music recognition (OMR), aimed toward the score images of the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP).  Our system focuses on measures as the basic unit of recognition.  We identify candidate composite symbols (chords and beamed groups) using grammatically-formulated top-down model-based methods, while employing template matching to find isolated rigid symbols.  We reconcile these overlapping symbols by seeking non-overlapping variants of the composite symbols that best account for the pixel data.  We present results on a representative score from the IMSLP.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The fundamental challenge posed by the digital environment is  how a small academic nonprofit publication can keep on top of it while preserving a modicum of academic standards.  As a free online encyclopedia that depends on private and federal grants, the Encyclopædia Iranica database must proactively attract visitors to its website. In the near future it is imperative that the project addresses two issues. The first is that the development of the digital database must reflect how search engines of different browsers crawl the web in the search of information, for in the end every search engine can only find that which has been coded and indexed for discovery. The other issue concerns the internal organization of the database.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bound up with debates over the origin of labor pain were concerns for how to accurately assess pain's intensity. Most clinical research on the efficacy of psychoprophylaxis centred on judging women's performance based on outward signs of suffering. Grimaces, clenched jaws, crying, and screaming were interpreted as indicators of the method's (or, more often, the woman's) failure. Sceptical of the accuracy of such cues and reluctant to trust the testimony of women themselves, some investigators sought what they touted as more objective measures of pain or predictors of women's pain threshold. For example, Sverdlovsk pharmacology professor A.K. Sangailo developed a machine he called to sensograph, which used electrodes to administer variable electric current to women in order to identify their pain threshold and predict their success or failure using psychoprophylaxis in labour.  Based on extensive archival research in Ukraine and Russia, this paper will analyze medical professional debates over the origin, role, and measurement of pain in childbirth as a window onto questions of mind-body medicine and gender dynamics in the clinical encounter.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The New York Public Library is participating in the Chronicling America initiative to develop an online searchable database of historically significant newspaper articles. Microfilm copies of the papers are scanned and high resolution OCR software is run on them. The text from the OCR provides a wealth of data and opinion for researchers and historians. However, the categorization of articles provided by the OCR engine is rudimentary and a large number of the articles are labeled editorial without further categorization. To provide a more refined grouping of articles, unsupervised machine learning algorithms (such as K-Means) are being investigated. The K-Means algorithm requires tuning of parameters such as the number of clusters and mechanism of seeding to ensure that the search is not prone to being caught in a local minima. We designed a pilot study to observe whether humans are adept at finding sub-categories. The subjective labels provided by humans are used as a guide to compare performance of the automated clustering techniques. In addition, seeds provided by annotators are carefully incorporated into a semi-supervised K-Means algorithm (Seeded K-Means); empirical results indicate that this helps to improve performance and provides an intuitive sub-categorization of the articles labeled ``editorial" by the OCR engine.  </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Chronicling America is an initiative of the National Endowment for Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LC) whose goal is to develop an online, searchable database of historically significant newspapers between 1836 and 1922. The New York Public Library (NYPL) is part of the initiative to participate in the first phase of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP). Between 2005 - 2009, it has scanned 200,000 newspaper pages published between 1890 - 1920 from microfilm. The goal of this research project is to enable users of the historical archive including scholars and other library patrons to efficiently search for relevant items and tag articles of interest to them. Unfortunately, the current search facilities are rudimentary and irrelevant documents are often more highly ranked than relevant ones. The newspapers are scanned on a page-by-page basis and article level segmentation is poor or non-existent; the OCR scanning process is far from perfect and the documents generated from it contain a large amount of garbled text. Our goal is to apply state-of-the-art text mining and machine learning algorithms for increasing retrieval performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In trying to understand the racial turn in conceptions of ethnicity in French America, historians have analyzed language, legal and marital practices, religious discourse and other largely abstract intellectual frameworks. What they have not done is pay attention to the evidence from the couples' daily lives. Rather than situate the debate about intermarriage in terms of intellectual and religious binaries, or positing a clear distinction between the views of Frenchmen in the colony and in France, I propose that we look instead to the material culture of intermarried households. For my analysis suggests that the tensions between supporters and opponents of intermarriage and métissage in Louisiana was primarily located in their degree of familiarity with the exceptional pattern of intermarriage in the Illinois Country, and the way that this was manifested through the frenchified bodies and dwellings emphasized in the locally produced records. The material culture expressions of these couples interfered with the seemingly inexorable rise of racialism in Louisiana, creating its own chronology, and highlighting the uneven development and fractured character of the process of racialization in North America. Or, to put it more compellingly: this evidence helps us grasp the implications of priests in the Illinois Country justifying intermarriage there by asserting, in 1732, that "there was no difference between a Christian sauvage  and a White."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 1627 Charter of New France had held out the promise that Indian converts would "be considered natural Frenchmen," ushering in a sequence of failed policies aimed at frenchifying ("franciser") Indians. By the time the Illinois Country was settled in the late seventeenth century, the premise of frenchification—that identity was mutable—had been largely displaced by proto-racial beliefs. Yet it would be here that missionaries and officials began to claim that women converts married to Frenchmen, and their progeny, had achieved Frenchness. They married in the Church, had their children baptized, and eventually lived not in Indian villages, but within French colonial houses in segregated French settlements, wearing French dress. In other words, they presented visual and material evidence of having frenchified, with the result that local officials and missionaries granted them the legal rights of Frenchmen. Rather than interpreting this adoption of French material culture as assimilation into the colonial order, I propose instead a gendered analysis that showcases the persistence of indigenous beliefs, thereby illuminating the authority of this group of women to define community through material culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1751, the Ursuline nuns of New Orleans initiated a new member, Marie Turpin, who was born to a French father and an Illinois Indian convert mother. The new Sister Ste. Marthewas not been accorded the spiritual rank of a full choir nun but only that of a converse (or domestic) nun. This nuance raises questions about how the Ursulines understood race with respect to Indians in mid-18th century New Orleans, especially when juxtaposed with their response one year later to a violent attack by a Frenchman on the body of one of their female (African) slaves. Asked if they planned to make their own declaration against the accused soldier, the Ursulines stated that the members of the convent (Marie Turpin among them) wished in no way "to get involved in this affair, neither as accusers nor as defendants," that on the contrary, they would rather their slave die than do anything against "the charity owed to" fellow French men and women. For both events, a key part of the evidence of the Ursulines' views of Indian and African members of their communities was produced by the nuns themselves, allowing us to contextualize how women accustomed to writing biographies for every member of their order responded when required to describe female "others."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the past 50 years, Miami has been home for the majority of Cuba's exile population. A common dimension of the exile experience is the refusal to relinquish affective ties to the place of origin. Because of the need to remain connected to a distant place that does not exist anymore, spatial devices - orientation, proximity and distance, directionality, mapping, and navigation – figure prominently in Cuban exile narratives. Though political exiles such as Miami's Cuban diaspora cannot literally return to Cuba, they preserve detailed maps of home in their hearts and minds which allow them to visit often.  Interviews and video from the 2011 Cuba Nostalgia Festival are used to explore how enormous floor maps of Havana, Cardenas, and the country of Cuba are utilized by exiles. The maps prompt exiles to look back in time and space to the Cuba of their childhood, as well as to establish new connections in the present among those whose memories center on the same places. This project illustrates how Cuban exiles fold time and space in ways that encourage a rethinking of placemaking.</Abstract>

But also: how did the Greek views change? What was the influence of philosophy? In what way do the gods in later antiquity differ from those in classical Greece ? In short, the aim of the conference is to acquire a synchronic and diachronic view of the gods as they functioned in Greek culture before the triumph of Christianity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2006, Nellie Y. McKay passed away after losing a hard-fought battle with cancer. Shortly before her passing, McKay shared a secret she had kept hidden from even her closest friends: not only was McKay a divorced mother of two, but the supposedly sixty-something-year-old scholar was also at least ten years older than her colleagues believed her to be. "Strategies not Truths" examines letters from McKay's thirty-year correspondence with Historian Nell Painter to explore how McKay's letters challenge the assumed candor of epistolary writing and, instead, mirror her academic perspectives on women writing autobiography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper, presented at the symposium "Francesco Petrarca: from manuscript to digital culture," 3 April 2010 was transformed into an article. This article examines the theoretical premises and consequences of the renewed attention to the intersection between philology, hermeneutics, and criticism in humanist studies in general and in Petrarch studies in particular. The most recent philological achievements–from the new facsimile of Rerum vulgarium fragmenta: Codex Vat. Lat. 3195 (Rvf), edited by Belloni, Brugnolo, Storey, and Zamponi to the new critical edition of Petrarch's masterpiece by Giuseppe Savoca–are presented and discussed as introduction to reflections on the role that a hypertext project, such as the Oregon Petrarch Open Book initiated at the University of Oregon, may play in the return to philology as necessary tool of textual criticism and hermeneutics. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper, presented at the symposium "Francesco Petrarca: from manuscript to digital culture," 3 April 2010 was transformed into an article. This article presents a research project developed by a group of scholars from different Italian universities; they plan to help construct the hypertext configuration of the Petrarch Project by attempting a first collective research on the fortunes of a single poem of the Rerum vulgarium fragmenta (Rvf), sonnet 35, "Solo et pensoso i più deserti campi." The ultimate aim of this mosaic work is to produce a synthetic, but integral, investigation of the fortunes and poetic interpretations of the text. Finally, the article discusses the new perspectives opened by the hypertext approach to the study of the reception of the Rvf. For this reason, this group of scholars extends an invitation to other researchers to collaborate in creating the map of the reception of sonnet 35 and other poems from Petrarch's Canzoniere.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper, presented at the symposium "Francesco Petrarca: from manuscript to digital culture," 3 April 2010 was transformed into an article. The colossal project of the Encyclopédie (1751-1772), directed by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, aimed to create, as Voltaire contends, "a repository of all sciences and arts," therefore establishing itself as the point of reference for literature, sciences, arts and crafts. This pretentious ambition contrasts in direct proportion with the peripheral depiction of Francis Petrarch. Although they acknowledge Petrarch's poetic talent and innovation, the authors of the Encyclopédie confine the Tuscan poet within the French poetical tradition. This gesture of appropriating what is exterior to the French image can be partly justified by the objective of the encyclopédistes to design a venue where a homogenous French identity can emerge. This paper attempts to track—by exploring various articles in the Encyclopédie along with their ramifications in other published works of the period—the ambivalent reception and portrayal of the Italian poet and humanist.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As Jim Kalmbach (2006) noted in the 10th anniversary issue of Kairos, the journal has had three distinct ages: "Beginnings: Moving Beyond Print (Volumes 1-4); Adolescent Exuberance: The Computers and Writing Issues (volumes 5-7); and Coming of Aging: New Media and Beyond (volumes 8-10)," as represented by the navigational choices and design practices that authors had used. Now that Kairos is 15 years old and moving into digital publishing's middle age, Presenter #1 (the editor of the journal) examines a new collection of metadata from the journal's back-issues to answer these questions: What has changed about the kinds of texts and authors Kairos publishes? What has stayed the same? What have we learned about digital genres, technological requirements, design standards, accessibility, metadata, and sustainability? How can the journal give back to the field? Reflecting on these answers has produced a set of best practices for the journal, which were implemented in an open-source content-management system for scholarly multimedia (based on Open Journal Systems). The research findings and deliverables of this project will be discussed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The focus of this presentation is a peer-review system that editors of Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy are currently building as part of the Open Journal Systems program. It will allow a/synchronous chats and discussions of live, interactive webtexts (Kairos's version of "articles" -- all of which are uniquely designed by authors using digital media). The system will also include sticky notes, highlight/pen functionality, and a "Share" system so that one user can make a note or highlight a portion of the webtext and share it with fellow online reviewers. All of the chats/discussions and stickies would be archived in the database for the editor to write review letters from.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy is a free, independent, open-access, digital journal that has been publishing scholarly multimedia on the Web since 1996. The overall sustainability and growth of Kairos is threatened by the burden of relying on the sweat equity of Rhetoric and Technical Communication scholars who study digital technologies and know enough about how to use them to be dangerous/innovative. The journal was in desperate need of an editorial system that could handle the submission, review, copy- and design-editing processes that are unique to webtexts. So we are building plug-ins for PKP's Open Journal Systems, which successfully manages print publications but cannot yet handle the kind of multimedia content that journals like Kairos (and increasingly others) want to publish. This presenter will discuss the history of the journal and others like it, show what webtexts are and how they are designed to make scholarly arguments, explain the journal's collaborative review and copy- and design-editing process, all in the service of showing why and how the multimedia modifications that we are building (which the next two speakers will address) will be of benefit to OJS and its user-base.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The National Digital Newspaper Program, a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress, is a long-term effort to develop an Internet-based, searchable database of U.S. newspapers with descriptive information and select digitization of historic pages. In 2010 the University of Tennessee and the Tennessee State Library and Archives were awarded funding to digitize 100,000 pages of historic Tennessee newspapers as part of this national project. In July 2011, Tennessee's first 14,000 pages were added to the Chronicling America Web site where the public can access them for free. Tennessee's Project Coordinator, Louisa Trott, will provide a background to the project and give a tour of the Chronicling America Website.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Keynote Address: About ten years ago, I began a long project about elephants which has focused on a basic historical question: why do we think about elephants in  the ways we have and do? It seemed obvious enough at the start that a great deal of what most people in the West think about elephants has very  little to do with the animals' actual lives and experiences in either their native range countries or in all the other places they have lived in traveled  over the last couple of hundred years. Simple questions about where such ideas as elephants never forget or elephants never strike out without  cause seemed to beg for some kind of historical study, especially since it was clear that ideas about elephants (like so many other animals) had  obviously changed so much in recent centuries. This presentation is a bookend to a paper I gave at the 2002 ISAZ meeting in London, and focuses  on the parts of elephants preserved in private and public collections, and what these collections can tell us about the ways we have come to think  about these animals. If the elephants of hunting accounts, zoos, circuses, and Hollywood have been asked (and some would say forced) to perform,  if their apparent resistance could even become an important part of the spectacles, in this paper I will look at what is left of elephants after they  have died, after they have become almost only a part of human history</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Keynote Address: As concern for animal extinction gained momentum at the beginning of the twentieth  century, many people, including figures like Carl Akeley, William Temple Hornaday, and C. G. Schillings, argued that perhaps the only way to preserve animals for the future was to  collect them immediately in photographs and museums.  Their ultimately impossible hope was to somehow stop time and perhaps even total extinction by preserving parts and images  of living animals.  This paper examines the idea of stopping time and extinction through  the use of photographic records and taxidermy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Plunkitt of Tammany Hall is often read as simply an apology for machine politics. Drawing on a close reading of Plunkitt and contemporary Tammany sources, this article challenges the conventional reading of the text, and orients readers toward the book's critique of developments in national politics, particularly under the party leadership of Grover Cleveland and William Jennings Bryan. In addition to defending machine politics, Plunkitt defends the traditional, Jacksonian party organization against nationalizing trends in U.S. party politics at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In recent years there has been a growing interest among scholars of Animal Studies in the place of taxidermized animals - and animal trophies more generally - in western cultures.Part of this interest stems from the efforts of numerous contemporary artists (and the scholarship about them, including obviously Steve Baker's work, but also ongoing examinations like those highlighted in Issues 6 and 7 of  Antennae ) to re-imagine the possibilities of using taxidermy to challenge viewers to consider their ideas about animals and human culture.Pieces like the reworked hunting trophies of Angela Singer or Maurizio Cattelan's suspended horse,  Novecento , are making animals visible in what are typically called "challenging" or "disturbing" ways.In one sense, these artists are battling the same problem taxidermists have faced for a very long time - how do we make the stuffed animals natural history collections, living rooms, and bars in any way compelling, something more than just a hollow hide.In this paper, I will explore the multiple roles that mounted specimens could play in the context of colonial hunting.By examining the histories of a variety of mounts (not just classics like antelopes, lions, and elephants, but also butterflies and even fish), the paper will build a historical context for our contemporary critiques of taxidermy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scotland, writing contests reigned supreme. They were an avenue within the university system for motivating students and regulating university curriculum—an important concern during the enlightenment period as the major Scottish Universities were moving away from Scholasticism in attempts to prepare their students for a widening range of careers—both in Scottish cites and to the south, in London. As City Comp attests, urban educational concerns often bridge "town and gown," as was certainly true in Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities, the hotbeds of Scottish enlightenment. In varying degrees both universities were governed in part by town councils, and educational reform was driven by local occupational, economic, and social concerns.  Outside the classroom, contests advanced critical thought, helped homogenize language use, and ensured the widespread recognition of competition sponsors' principles and beliefs. As the Scots struggled over issues of nationalism and conformity, contests called attention to both concerns by bringing recognition to issues of national pride while simultaneously serving to align the Scots with both English and Continental thought and practice. The contests of the period shed light on cultural and educational identification issues of the time, but also provide historical illustrations of contemporary theories connecting composition instruction and production to issues of liminal space and physical place where the boundaries between the classroom, public discourse, business and industry shift and sometimes dissolve.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An examination of manuscript holdings in America reveals that Scottish-based educational philosophy often labeled the "Princeton School," an alternative to Harvard's vastly influential curriculum, echoes the philosophical theories of Scottish rhetorician George Jardine, Professor of Logic and Philosophy at Glasgow University (1774-1824). Jardine instructed many Scots who later immigrated to North America and held prestigious positions within higher education and religious circles. In particular, the educational practices of Alexander Campbell at Bethany College and James McCosh at Princeton College clearly bear the mark of Scottish philosophy and pedagogy as codified in Jardine's foundational treatise The Outlines of Philosophical Education (1818, 1825). To demonstrate ways in which Jardine's rhetorical theory (based on Scottish Common Sense Realism and Baconian scientific induction) served American democratic philosophies of education, I would like today to recount Jardine's reputation as the spokesperson for the early nineteenth-century Scottish pedagogical system and illuminate his influence within the teaching philosophies of Campbell and McCosh.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jardine's work offers rich insights into eighteenth- and nineteenth-century rhetorical theory and practice, while providing opportunities for present-day research in writing instruction and administration, the rhetoric of science and religion, and political and social rhetoric. The manuscripts held in the Campbell Collection and testimony from the career of Princeton President James McCosh indicate that Jardine's sphere of influence reached across the Atlantic, but we are just beginning to understand the far-reaching influence of Jardine's educational philosophies and practices. As yet, we have neither an intellectual biography of Jardine nor a full-length analysis of his teaching plan. I suspect further investigations into Jardine's body of work will reveal that he not only codified Scotland's educational plan but also contributed to the nation's rhetorical theory, seen particularly in his conception of epistemic writing instruction and assessment, and his philosophies concerning student learning. Certainly these aspects of Jardine's rhetorical theory were appealing to Alexander Campbell and James McCosh, visible in these American educator's emphasis on student responsibility, focus on individual student judgment, and reliance on written compositions as a means of self-improvement and knowledge acquisition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Holy grave robbers, a conspiracy of silence, a forgotten coffin, an empty tomb, hidden bones, exhumations, cranial measurements—"The Amazing Adventures of Dante's Bones" assembles and interprets these and other pieces of Dante's skeletal history from his death in Ravenna in 1321 to a computer-generated reconstruction of his face in 2006. As Italy prepares to celebrate its 150th birthday as a nation, many scholars are turning their attention to issues of Italian nationhood and identity. This talk highlights Dante's important place in this discussion by showing how individuals and institutions have used events surrounding his tomb and remains to promote various political, religious, and cultural agendas. Arguing that physical claims on Dante's bones are ideological claims on his legitimating authority, "Amazing Adventures" traces the poet's evolution from an object of regional rivalry in the Renaissance and the founding father of Italy in the nineteenth century into a nationalist symbol during the fascist period before becoming the global icon he is today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Even though video games have been around for over 40 years, employing them as viable learning environments is relatively new. In the last few years, many people have begun researching games and learning: how to make them, use them, and assess what is happening when learners use them.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, we utilized a consulting collaborative approach, created a Native American Advisory Board, made a prototype, 2D mini-game that focuses on the Newark Earthworks in Ohio, USA as a lunar observatory, and obtained additional funding to create an affinity space (Gee, 2012). This poster presents the 2D mini games that will be part of a larger game that demonstrates the moon's monthly cycle as it is observed at the Newark Earthworks, a world heritage nominated site. We will explain our learning objectives, design process, and how games teach.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Earthworks spans several kilometers. The Earthworks Octagon precisely tracks the northernmost moonrise; Building something that is seemingly focused on an event that occurs only every 18.6 years is striking! In addition, that's just one section of the Earthworks. What were they doing every 18.6 years that would lead them to construct such an enormous structure?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; We think that exploring this structure and the culture of ancient Native Americans, learners will be inspired to learn more about astronomy and begin observing the moon themselves.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Demo and Poster&amp;#x0D; I would like to have my computer run a demo of the 2D mini game and hang a poster. In additional we will have a link to our website (currently in development). &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeology, a discipline that often relies upon destructive methodologies, urgently needs to make data sharing and preservation an accepted norm. However, the realities of professional incentives and the lack of clear research outcomes based on shared data inhibit many from participating in data sharing. This presentation will present a model of "data sharing as publication" to explore how editorial workflows can make research data valuable for both data contributors and users. We will present examples from Open Context (http://opencontext.org), an open access, web-based platform for publishing archaeological data. We will discuss the challenges and benefits of publishing data on the web, including professional incentives, ethical issues, copyright concerns, and approaches to working with "messy" data. Finally, we will raise questions regarding how technology can shape understandings of the past. Does good data management require monolithic standardization and centralization? How will broad access to digital data impact the way we do research (methods, interpretations, and collaborations)?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Online digital humanities collections have grown rapidly in scope and significance over the past decade. Museums, archives, and libraries increasingly make their collections available on the Web. In spite of these successes, datasets created by individual researchers still see little dissemination or preservation. Researchers must see clear evidence that data sharing is worth their time and effort. They need to be convinced that data dissemination will further their career goals and contribute substantively toward knowledge creation (Harley et al., 2010). These challenges are deeply interrelated. Efficient aggregation and modeling of disparate collections can open new research opportunities that cross disciplinary boundaries (Onsrud and Campbell 2007).&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; To reach the point where researcher data can be used by a wider community, datasets must have sufficient quality and documentation. To give context, data also need to be related and linked with shared concepts and with other datasets available on the Web. Doing all this requires effort. New skills, professional roles, and scholarly communication channels need to be created to meet the specific requirements of meaningful data sharing. This paper presents a model of "data sharing as publication," where adapting existing workflows and norms of scholarly communication to the dissemination of structured data can increase professional acceptance of data sharing. Appropriate workflows that enhance datasets with Linked Open Data dissemination methods can align the needs of researchers with the rapidly-expanding capabilities of the Web of Data. Such efforts will demonstrate to the professional community how data publishing can recognize individual scholarly contributions and create information resources with greater capacity to enhance understanding than possible if datasets remained in isolation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Virtual Paul's Cross Project (vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu) uses visual and acoustic modeling software to recreate the appearance of Paul's Churchyard in 1622 and to explore the acoustic properties of this site for open-air preaching in the early modern period.  The process of developing this project has shifted attention from the early modern sermon as a printed or manuscript text to consideration of the sermon as a performance in a particular physical setting and before a specific congregation. Even though the surviving manuscripts or printed texts of these sermons provide access to the content of the performed text, they are at best memorial reconstructions of the actual text as delivered. Early modern sermons were composed in performance from notes to recall for the preacher his prior preparation, described by Walton in his Life of Donne as including choice and division of the text, gathering of quotes from the Church Fathers, and articulation and organization of major points.  This paper will focus on one way we can learn from traces that survive in sermon texts of earlier stages of the sermon's development and of the conditions of original performance, as provided by Donne's sermon for Gunpowder Day in 1622. This sermon contains sentence fragments that may be survivals of the notes Donne took with him into the pulpit, while the sentences around them suggest what Donne made of these notes in the process of his delivery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My essay fashions an argument about the place and importance of women singers in Pakistan, as a way to understand the evolution of Pakistani culture and the impact of women on it. &amp;#x0D; The female artists I will discuss represent the best hope for a secular and progressive Pakistan, and therefore, their lives and negotiations for recognition in a male-dominated culture must be highlighted. Thus, a contemporary concert featuring the internationally renowned female Sufi (sacred/mystic) singer Abida Parveen, raises questions about affect  and the politics of gender. Her appearance on stage, with her wild curly hair framing her manly face as she sways to the music she sings, the audience clapping and swaying along with her, celebrates the quest for divine love, through  a language steeped in earthly metaphors of what has could be variously interpreted as hetero or homoerotic desire. Juxtaposed with a closing shot  from a 1970 film featuring a song by playback singer Noor Jehan (another  major female singer of Pakistan),  shows a popular actress of that era, the voluptuous Firdaus, lip-syncing and dancing to Noor Jehan's famous song, "Sun Wanjhali Di Meethri Taan" (Listen to my beautiful flute"), as her earthly lover/beloved Ranjha plays in the foreground on his flute, his long hair and effeminate get-up the mark of a Sufi dervish (saint).  Such contrasting musical styles, the first representing the sacred, the second secular, raise questions regarding the place of music and female performers in Pakistani society:  If human love is a reflection of the divine, how can love songs be the mark of the devil? How can women as both objects of desire and desiring subjects, be sinful creatures as extremists looking to ban music and female performance insist?&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>MostPixelsEver – Cluster Edition is an extension of the &amp;#x0D; Processing programming environment that enables visualization &amp;#x0D; in cluster-driven display environments without extensive &amp;#x0D; knowledge of programming languages, graphics interfaces, or &amp;#x0D; distributed computing. The work described here enables visual &amp;#x0D; artists, humanities scholars and students, and even traditional &amp;#x0D; programmers to create interactive visualizations in high-resolution &amp;#x0D; distributed environments with simplicity. MostPixelsEver hides &amp;#x0D; the inherent complexity of distributed environments by &amp;#x0D; abstraction, and makes it possible to rapidly create visualizations &amp;#x0D; on large displays.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>1000 Words is a project to enable discoveries at extreme scale in the Humanities. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), this project aims to make advanced visualization systems attached to high performance computing resources both useful and usable for scholars in the arts and humanities. This paper describes Massive Pixel Environment (MPE), our initial effort toward this goal. Massive Pixel Environment is a software library developed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) for extending Processing sketches to multi-node tiled displays. Processing is an open source programming language and environment for creating images, animations and interactions. MPE significantly lowers the learning curve and time needed to develop software and interactive visualizations for multi-node tiled displays. We will discuss the applications and implications of MPE for the sciences, humanities, and media arts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Auralization has become a valuable tool to explore the acoustics of spaces and activities that no longer exist. Generally, acoustical archaeology has explored a fairly limited number of sources in a space to determine specific acoustical aspects of the sound of the spaces and to separate intentionally designed acoustical phenomena from the often unintended effects of the architecture. We have expanded this technique to recreate the entire soundscape of a specific event, in this case John Donne's 1622 Gunpowder Plot sermon at Paul's Cross, outside St. Paul's Cathedral&amp;#x0D; in London as it was prior to the fire of 1666. This work augments ambisonic auralization techniques with techniques borrowed from computeraided music composition and audio production to create an immersive acoustical environment for the purpose of exploring the experience of listeners at many positions in a crowd that can be varied in size in real time. The paper outlines the role of geometric acoustics modeling, realtime convolution, randomized and statistically-derived sound event triggers, and other techniques employed to auralize a soundscape that&amp;#x0D; includes the sermon, crowd response, and the ambient sounds of pre-Industrial London.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Interdisciplinary teaching poses daunting challenges, even for faculty with multiple areas of expertise. I felt these challenges acutely when developing a course supported by the "Enduring Questions" grant program of the National Endowment for the Humanities. In this presentation I describe the course design, summarize approaches to assessment, and discuss the challenges and opportunities I encountered when teaching the course. Students examined three historical eras, starting with the late fourteenth century—a time in which clocks started to proliferate in medieval towns. They also contrasted the "clockwork universe" of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with the views of philosophers and scientists in the early twentieth century, who were grappling with the implications of Einstein's relativity theories. Readings for the course included excerpts from Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," Isaac Newton's "Principia," Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time," and James Joyce's short story, "The Dead."  These texts supported the study of temporality in musical works that include medieval chansons, Haydn's "Joke" quartet, and Ravel's opera "L'Heure espagnole."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation was given by Doug Holland and Trish Rose-Sandler at the Missouri Libraries Association conference held in St Louis MO in Oct 2013. There is a significant online literature and image repository called the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL). Content from this repository has inspired a range of users to re-contextualize the BHL data in new, previously unimagined roles including: scientists creating visualizations of species names publishing; citizen scientists blogging about fascinating creatures; designers incorporating marine life into wedding invitations, artists creating collages of animal illustrations and nature photography ; and home decorators adding punch and wit to the walls of their kids bedrooms. Using the example of BHL and its open data principles, the presentation will discuss what open data is and how libraries can expand the impact and reach of their collections through open data methods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) has now achieved a critical mass of digitized historic texts – over 41 million pages and counting. The BHL portal can be searched by several access points including title, author, subject, and scientific name. But, what is largely hidden and entirely unsearchable are the millions of natural history illustrations found with the BHL books and journals. These visual resources which include drawings, paintings, photographs, maps and diagrams represent work by some of the finest botanical and zoological illustrators in the world, including the likes of John James Audubon, Georg Dionysus Ehret, and Pierre Redouté. Many of the illustrations are the first recorded descriptions of much of the world's biota, providing the scientific foundation for contemporary taxonomic research and conservation assessments. Some of them are the only verifiable resource about an organism and their existence on Earth due to changes in global climate patterns and rapid loss of natural habitat for many species. Audiences for these illustrations also cross a variety of disciplines and include: biologists, artists, historians, illustrators, graphic designers, archivists, educators, students, and citizen scientists. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In 2012, the Missouri Botanical Garden was awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support a project called The Art of Life: Data Mining and Crowdsourcing the Identification and Description of Natural History Illustrations from the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL). This talk will discuss the Art of Life objectives and current status. It will go into detail about the algorithms and schema designed for finding which pages contain illustrations and describing the subsequent output. Finally the talk will discuss the project's benefits for the scientific community such as improving access to a significant collection of public domain images related to biodiversity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The use of visual and acoustic modeling software enables us to integrate a variety of kinds of evidence for the look and sound of Paul's Churchyard, outside St Paul's Cathedral, in London in the early modern period. The Virtual Paul's Cross Project brings together visual images from the historic record with physical evidence from archaeological surveys as well as weather and climate conditions to create the look and sound of London in November of 1622.  We have learned from this project that preachers at Paul's Cross could have been heard throughout the churchyard, if they used a measured delivery, that sermons preached from notes enable the preacher to be flexible and responsive to the crowd, and that texts of sermons are at best memorial reconstructions of events created in the process of their performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>1609 was a year of great expectations and extravagant building projects in greater London, not least of them naval. The greatest merchant ship of the age, the Trades Increase, was christened by the king at Deptford in December while the enormous Prince Royal, the first three-decker built for the English navy, neared completion at Woolwich. The great ships were too wide of beam to pass through their respective dock-heads, however, and both launches, to the embarrassment of the builders, initially failed. Noting Jacobean England's enjoyment of ships as mobile fortresses and engines of thunderous spectacle, the paper analyses the shipwright Phineas Pett's relations with Prince Henry and other patrons and thus explains the surplus value of ostentation in the ship Pett built for the Prince, an exorbitant vessel that within a decade required costly retrofits to stay in service. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Modern Art Iraq Archive (MAIA) project is a participatory content-management system to share, trace and enable community enrichment of the modern art heritage of Iraq. The focus of the project is thousands of works of art, many of them now lost, from the Iraqi Museum of Modern Art in Baghdad. MAIA is unique in that it not only documents the lost artworks, but also provides tools for community enhancement of those works, allowing contribution of stories, knowledge and documentation to the system, as well as syndication of the content elsewhere on the web.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; For the past eight months, participants in this project have been building a comprehensive virtual archive of the works in the Museum's various galleries, including a database of images and information about the objects (artist name, title, date, dimensions, subject matter, medium, condition, current location, related works, etc). These significant national treasures are displayed in an open format that invites participation from users worldwide, including the Iraqi national and expatriate communities, and users will be encouraged to help identify and understand individual pieces. The MAIA system, which integrates two extant content management systems, Open Context and Omeka, will provide a valuable research tool for scholars, students, as well as the general public, but most importantly for Iraqis: these works of art form an important expression of the Iraqi national experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the process of creating a permanent physical exhibit showcasing the work of the Arizona Digital Newspaper Program (ADNP) in the context of the Territorial Governor's room at the Arizona Capitol Museum. The exhibit will consist of a stand-alone kiosk with a touch-screen monitor that will allow viewers to interact with the ADNP website, a tutorial that guides the user through using the ADNP website effectively, and a trivia game that connects the Territorial Governors with the newspapers in the ADNP collections. The paper will include the reasons why we chose to focus on the governors we did, why the exhibit is the best format to reach the public in an informative and engaging way, the collaboration between departments, the participation of volunteers in the project, and the challenge and potential for incorporating digital newspapers into a larger museum setting.  We believe that this type of outreach and collaboration is invaluable to digital newspaper programs. Often these programs focus primarily (and more or less, naturally) on their web presence.  We believe that, on top of outreach at events, by giving the broadest sectors of the public access to and information on our digital newspaper resources we can make visible a previously hidden or obscured set of primary sources once available only by physically accessing an institution. Today, digital newspaper collections endeavor to bring historical documents to the public's fingertips and we believe the ADNP interactive exhibit will help even more people become aware of and learn how to access this particular pulse on history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Asking students to explore cultures, life experiences, and worldviews different from their own has been shown to have a high impact on student engagement. Students often enjoy learning about diverse cultures and engaging in debate about "difficult differences" such as racial, ethnic, and gender inequality. Such conversations and explorations, however, can also be quite difficult for both students and instructors. In this roundtable discussion, three members of CSUSB NEH grant faculty learning community on bridging cultures in an era of internationalization prompted dialogue among the participants by sharing some of their own experiences as they have attempted to teach about various cultures and cultural diversity. The discussants talked about the complications that can arise when instructors are not members of the culture being explored, as well as the complications that arise when they are. They also shared their best practices, teaching strategies, and pedagogical strategies for dealing with these issues.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay sets up a dialogue between the self-narrative of an irregular cavalryman (deli) Deli Mustafa that recounts the campaigns he took part in between 1801/2 and 1825 and the corpus of Ottoman archival sources written about Kara Feyzi, an irregular soldier (sekbân) and bandit leader who marshaled a successful, trans-regional organized crime network that pillaged Ottoman Rumeli from 1793 to 1823. It does so in order to tell a larger story about how imperial governance came to depend on wide-spread networks of violence for defending and policing the Empire but became imbricated in their criminal activities during this period of Ottoman history. Together, Kara Feyzi and Deli Mustafa's stories shed light on much larger interpretative and moral communities forged upon the same kinds of "texts," narrative strategies, group experiences, exchange of material and symbolic resources, or simply a concept like honor woven throughout the narratives</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1711, toward the end of the decade-long War of the Spanish Succession, the cathedral chapter of the archdiocese of Mexico published an impassioned account of its many displays of loyalty on behalf of Philip V. After almost two centuries of Habsburg rule, Philip V and his advisors were under no illusions that Spanish subjects would transfer their loyalty over easily from Carlos II and, for this reason, ordered constant public demonstrations of loyalty throughout the course of the war. Mexico City's cathedral chapter responded accordingly and opened its account with Psalm 62, verse 12: "But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things."&amp;#x0D; Using cathedral chapter and municipal council minutes and a large body of published sermons, this paper focuses on the secular and religious elite of Mexico City's attempts to stop the utterance of "wicked things" during the War of the Spanish Succession. Loyalty to the Habsburg house would prove hard to combat, as evidenced by several people arrested in Mexico for supposedly rooting for the Austrian Alliance. In order to combat disloyalty, the municipal council, cathedral chapter, and all of the city's convents organized a variety of public ceremonies in support of the Bourbon house, including masses and festivities honoring the birth of crown prince Louis I, funerary honors for fallen soldiers, and, finally, masses of thanksgiving marking Spain's imminent victory in 1711. Taken together, these commemorations helped to cast the Bourbon king as Spain's "savior," a trope that would continue throughout the eighteenth century and shapes the historiography of the early modern Spanish Empire to this day.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Achumawi verb tuci [duji], like English "do", can be used in construction with a word that is not a verb to form a verb phrase. There is a large class of verbs ending with suffix -ci that probably has this origin historically.This diachronic process seems to be observable in some verbs showing stages of noun incorporation. Construction with tuci may be a productive way to accommodate loan words in language revitalization work that is now becoming more active. This paper presents a variety of examples that demonstrate these relationships and some additional implications.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In mid-July 1886 Sarah Bernhardt finally arrived to Buenos Aires via Rio de Janeiro, where spectators eagerly awaited her presence at a limited number of functions. Bernhardt had just missed the debut of the Creole drama Juan Moreira, previously presented as a pantomime and now enhanced with talking characters. For the next month and a half, news of both Bernhardt and Moreira appeared together in the Buenos Aires press. And it would be easy to imagine the prima donna attending any number of forms of popular entertainment during her stay, for her arrival coincided with the new spectacles of the Carlos Brothers (a U.S. circus family) and Frank Brown (an English clown), while the Italian showman Pablo Raffetto put on "unauthorized" version of Moreira. At the end of July Bernhardt left the capital and traveled north to Rosario, and then in August she acted in La Plata and completed her Rioplatense tour in Montevideo. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Bernhardt's South American tour obviously tells us something about her fearlessness to brave Transatlantic travel. But beyond this quality of her character, her time in the Plata river region reveals a rich entertainment market whose performers followed a circuit including Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and, above all, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, and smaller towns along the tributary rivers leading to the Río de la Plata. The decade of 1880 was a moment of significant growth in the number of participants in this entertainment market, but by this time it already had a history half a century deep. This paper explores how hemispheric travelers contributed to the consolidation of this entertainment market beginning in the late 1820s, and the new forms of sociability that emerged in the process.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeological Institute of America 2014 Annual Meeting Workshop: Managing Multidisciplinary Field Research Projects: Best Practices and Problem-solving Strategies&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Multidisciplinary field research projects have increasingly become the norm in archaeology.  Geoarchaeologists, archaeobotanists, zooarchaeologists, and bioarchaeologists among others are members of the field research team.  On the excavation complex sampling protocols for radiocarbon dating, organic residue analysis, phytolith analysis, and the like need to be followed.  The complexity of these projects requires planning and management skills for which few archaeologists are prepared.  Bringing the multifaceted results of these projects to publication can be particularly challenging.  In this workshop directors and members of multidisciplinary field research projects present and discuss best practices and problem-solving strategies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the codification in paintings of ideal Indic heroines called nayikas, some of whom were based on earlier sculptural prototypes.  Defined in the visual arts by their conventional poses and motifs, these nayikas entered into a wide range of pictorial contexts, including illustrations of poetic and devotional texts and the pages of Mughal albums, called muraqqa, which combined painting with beautifully calligraphed texts. The Indic nayika joined European, Persian, and Mughal female ideals in a richly varied repertoire of types, which painters would continue to draw on well into the 19th and 20th centuries. Related to this phenomenon was a growing profusion of portraits that pictured elite Mughal and Rajput men with beautiful women, some of them types and some possibly representing wives or mistresses. Focusing on the Indic nayika, this paper examines her aesthetic and social significance in the early years of her codification, especially in relation to the broader proliferation of pictures of female beauties. Particular attention is given to the production and reception of nayika imagery in domains of elite social pleasure, where she would have been surrounded with poetry, music, dance, food and drink, friendship, and love. The paper builds on recent scholarship that understands the Mughal and Rajput worlds to have been mutually constitutive, and on a growing dialogue between South Asian art history and cultural studies, while addressing the need for more sustained theorization of the central place of gender in the visual arts of the Mughal era.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thousands of graffiti on the walls of Pompeii attest to a vibrant culture of informal writing. In this paper, we examine the practice of inscribing personal messages on columns, with a focus on the Campus ad Amphitheatrum, in Pompeii (Regio II.7.1). Featuring more than 400 handwritten wall-inscriptions, this was the most heavily inscribed building in the entire city. We seek to answer why. This paper presents the results of fieldwork carried out by the Ancient Graffiti Project during summer 2019.      The Campus offered a large, colonnaded, multi-purpose space near the amphitheater. By virtue of its location, the building certainly saw a high volume of traffic. In this paper we examine how ancient writers approached this unique type of writing surface, how they negotiated the lack of horizontal space, and how they fashioned their writings in response. We also interrogate the spaces of the building and the distribution patterns of textual and figural graffiti on the columns of the Campus ad amphitheatrum to address the following questions: On which columns within a long colonnade were individuals more prone to write? Where would a writer prefer to stand? Within the covered walkway? Between the columns where he would be less visible? In the uncovered space where fewer might see his drawing or message? By surveying and analyzing the hundreds of wall-inscriptions in this building, we seek to understand how people interacted in this space and why they found columns such an attractive place to write.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Oral histories are frequently used to document critical and complex socio-political moments. Researchers editing and re-presenting those oral histories for the public face numerous ethical decisions. In this interactive listening session, participants will be asked to comment on these decisions and reflect on their broader implications as oral history moves outside the archives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Implements, ornaments, and outright treasures in American homes that were sourced from once-living creatures (rather than plants) often come under the heading of hard matrix organics. Horns, hooves, shells, and teeth were beguiling elements adapted for general human domestic needs. Some organic items were imbued with meanings in religious or folklore practices, others were valued for medicinal properties, and still others for study or marvel as curiosities of nature. These materials also challenged artisans to explore their properties and push limits for their conceptualizations of beauty. With contact and colonization, exchange and appreciation led to the exploitation of some of these natural resources as well as the labor that procured them. Studies of Native American material culture as well as Atlantic World trade address organics and their exchange, particularly in instances of plenty or scarcity, but decorative arts scholarship on the subject has room to grow. This presentation will offer an overview of several organic materials with historic impact not just for their novelty or utility, but for fostering development in early American arts and habits of domestic life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As part of Valparaiso University's Flight Paths project, I worked on archiving and digitizing important documents at St. John's Lutheran Church in Gary, Indiana. My research follows the history of the church from its beginning as a church plant in Tolleston (now annexed into Gary) onwards with an emphasis on how the church adapted and changed during the period of White Flight in Gary. As more black residents moved into Gary, white residents packed up and left. Coupled with the closing of many of Gary's factories, the result was a drastic shift in racial and economic demographics. The church, which is part of the Lutheran Church Missouri-Synod, survived White Flight largely due to the efforts of interim pastor Karl Lutze and the next resident pastor, Norman Brandt, who were both dedicated to integration of the church. The efforts for integration were largely successful, leading to a period where the church was a mixed congregation before becoming a predominantly African American church.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper discusses the contributions of Howard University scholars to debates on the race problem, and their own efforts to address the geopolitics of knowledge during the 1930s-1940s.  By the 1930s, Howard had assembled a critical mass of stellar black intellectuals, part of what DuBois termed the Talented Tenth.  In the midst of turbulent years in American race relations, Howard scholars not only sought to practice socially relevant social science and advance a public intellectual model by linking their scholarship and teaching with intellectual activism, they aimed to put in place an institutional architecture that embodied the commitment to using interdisciplinary social science, global perspectives, and transcultural forms of knowledge to inform social action.  The Howard scholars initiated a series of annual conferences, lectures and forums intended to institutionalize an approach to American race relations that was situated in the politics of global anti-colonialism, and that presented race and class as inextricably intertwined.  It was through these institutional spaces that this cohort of radical black scholar-activists engaged the national and global public around the salient issues of the day, and forged meaningful personal and professional networks cemented in a world-spanning, transcultural community.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ralph Bunche's enduring fame arises from his brilliant diplomatic service in the United Nations and the leadership role he played in brokering the armistice agreements between Israel and the Arab States, for which he became the first person of color to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Now memorialized as the negotiator of the United Nations partition of Palestine, it  will come as a surprise to most that Bunche initially advanced a binational solution to the Jewish question and the question of Palestine, over that of partition.  As Alex Lubin has argued, Bunche's thinking/position, in the 1930s and early 1940s, aligned with a group of Afro-Arab and Jewish intellectuals and activists who  embraced a politics of binationalism (or anti nationalism) that recognized the multinational possibilities of the land of Palestine and pushed back against the rise of new ethnic-nationalisms during the global upheavals of the interwar era.  (Lubin, 2014).  However, the potent counter-discourse of binationalism was quickly muted by anti colonial nationalisms and a formidable discourse of national sovereignty.  Partition, an idea originally conceived after WWI as part of a new type of imperial governance in the guise of internationalism, after 1945, seemed to offer a quick and efficient exit strategy while maintaining the possibility of continued post colonial influence for Britain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The American Prison Writing Archive (APWA) is the largest and first fully searchable digital archive of non-fiction essays by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside. The APWA currently hosts 2,168 essays, or over 2.8 million words of direct prison witness. This is a word count equal to one quarter of the entire known corpus of slave narrative; the APWA echoes that corpus by bringing first-person voices forward to resist constructed misrepresentation of the subjects of an institution committed to legally sanctioned violence.  Like slave narrators, authors in the APWA help us to measure and thus to ask (again), What is the cost in human suffering of the current legal order?   This paper will briefly review the creation of an analog collection project that evolved into the APWA when essays kept coming after the deadline, forcing a break beyond analog print and onto a digital platform.  The paper will point to the ethical implications of clicking onto scanned pages composed by writers who testify to the human experience of the gravitational center of the law's violence, the center of the same legal horizon upon which the reader sits and that is revealed by reading prison witness.  It will also address an ethical hazard raised by digital methods: The APWA's scale, addressed with computational aids, makes it possible to atomize and re-datify the work of writers seeking to extract themselves—as individuals with full human dignity—from among the data piles of social science and the mass-scale prison.  Drawing upon graphic models offered by Darwin and Koebler—by way of Franco Moretti—the paper will describe a text analysis plan that both respects the integrity of each prison witness, and helps readers understand that these are witnesses who speak for the silenced inside the mass prison.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper reveals how merchant and clerical communities in sixteenth century India parlayed 'mundane' forms of literacy like accounting and record keeping into privileged forms of 'literary' activity, in the process becoming a significant force for the spread and development of Hindi literature. I examine the account books, notebooks, and other handwritten documents of several merchant 'clans' to demonstrate how mercantile and clerical writing scripts, scribal and record keeping techniques, and even the material form of financial and political records shaped the look, shape, and 'feel' of literary 'books' in this period. The upshot is that merchants played a much larger role in Hindi literary history than has previously been acknowledged.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The hagiographical poems of religious communities in Rajasthan, including the Dadu Panth, Niranjani Sampraday, and Ramanandi Sampraday provide rich accounts of the social lives of communities, including communal singing and other types of performance. In this way these narratives simultaneously historicize performance practices of the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries while performing the histories of saints and their followers. This presentation uses examples from the Dadu Janm Lila (1620) of Jangopal, the Sant Gu? Sagar (1604) of Madhavdas, the Bhaktamal (1660) of Raghavdas, the Dayal Ji Ki Pañc Paracaï (c. 1730) of Hariramdas, and the Bhaktamal (c. 1600) of Nabhadas, as well as singer's handwritten notebooks from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to reconstruct historical performances and show how hagiographical works 'work'.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Funded by a two-year curricular development grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a team of two historians and one biologist at Dean College has created and implemented two courses that bring historical pedagogy into the science laboratory. Although we aimed for these courses to serve majors in science and medical fields, we chose to embed them within the general education curriculum, in order to create new learning opportunities for all students on campus. Dean is a four-year, private liberal arts institution in Franklin, MA, which attracts a diverse array of underserved student populations. Specifically, we developed the courses—one in the history of science and one in the history of medicine—during AY2017-2018 and then implemented them during AY2018-2019. They are fully integrated with laboratory instruction. The first course, "History of Science," takes a general survey approach, both in lecture and lab, covering a variety of scientific disciplines. The second course, "Beyond Henrietta Lacks," narrows the focus to issues of race and medicine in American history in lecture and to related scientific and medical concepts in a cell biology lab. In both courses, students attend a lecture (covering historical and scientific concepts) with an attached lab, in which they perform or simulate historical experiments. We hypothesize that this combination will improve student learning outcomes, learning experiences, and attitudes toward science. Using a variety of assessment instruments, we have generated a body of qualitative and quantitative data on student learning, experiences, and attitudes across the first year of this new general education curriculum, which we intend to share with colleagues through this paper.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>David Brandon Dennis I led a two-year NEH-funded project at Dean College to develop two integrative general education courses blending history of science and the history of medicine with a science lab.  In our assessment of the project we found that these courses significantly improved student experiences and attitudes toward science and history. I team-taught one of the courses ("History of Science") with a biologist colleague. My role as project director allows me to speak to the experience of organizing and training faculty, mobilizing institutional resources, and integrating the new courses into our broader core curriculum.  Jessica Pisano Entering into our History of Science and Medicine integrating teaching project as the traditionally trained scientist, my first challenge was learning how to learn and think like a historian. As the member of the team who spanned both classes, I had the additional challenge of bridging not just "two cultures" but two colleagues. While time consuming, these two facets of the project have enhanced my teaching well beyond our integrated courses and continues to influence my development of a biology major at Dean College.    R.A. Lawson In our multi-year NEH-funded project, my role was to shape the cultural history investigations and narratives as relate to social factors such as ethnicity/race, gender, class, etc. I was therefore most involved in the creation of our history-biology dyad course, "Beyond Henrietta Lacks: Race and Medicine in 20th Century America," which paired cultural history lectures with biology labs. Most exciting to me in this process—in addition to the rewarding collaboration with our consultants and my institutional colleagues—was inhabiting the space of the student-learner for the lab sessions, modeling genuine joy of learning alongside our students. The main challenge I experienced was the attempt to limit the scope of the course, because each subtopic inevitably led to a fascinating web of inquiry.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In April 2018, New York City authorities followed the lead of several other institutions that had memorialized the work of J. Marion Sims—the "father of gynecology" and developer of a breakthrough surgery to repair vesico-vaginal fistula—by removing from Central Park a statue depicting the 19th century Alabama doctor. Much of Sims' experimental work was accomplished by operating on enslaved women. The removal of the statue opened yet another chapter in the contemporary American struggle with race and historical memory—the intersection of slavery and medicine—while layering an important second theme: gender. Investigating the careers of Sims and other antebellum Gulf South medical practitioners—white, black, male, female—presents the human body and its medical treatment as a key battlefield for the working out of the social constructions of race and gender. This helps us explain the tendency of public memories of racism and sexism to invoke the history of medicine.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Shortly after the Civil War ended, the zoo movement, alongside other urban cultural movements, swept the United States, both in the North and the South. The history of American zoos, of course, have much to say about the history of conservation, animal history, historical ecology, the history of science and medicine, and evolutionary history as they, in turn, inform histories of nation-building, urbanization, and empire. Zoos, though, can also tell (bio) political stories. While zoogoers themselves rarely encountered politics along zoo footpaths, in the halls of Congress the ties that bound the National Zoo and its animals to politics proved more visible, especially when the topic of the zoo exploded into years of intense sectional debate in the House of Representatives. The National Zoological Park, as the only zoo in American history whose governance fell under the purview of the federal legislature, offers a unique window into a semiology that fused animals to debates about government that divided a nation through and after the Civil War. Animals were used by Congressmen to conjure sectional ideologies that could not be wielded as aggressively in an era of reconciliation. Using methods derived from animal studies, this essay will call attention to the sectionalism of the National Zoo.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract: What are the essential formal qualities of socialism, and how may those forms be translated by migrants in new national-social contexts in which alternative economic values prevail? My study considers the intersecting careers of a cohort of entrepreneurial socialists who formed their beliefs and practiced their professions in the new republics of post-Habsburg Central Europe: the sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld, the architect Victor Gruen, and the artist-designer László Moholy-Nagy. Having come of age during the period of interwar socialist experimentation in Vienna, Budapest, and Berlin, they arrived in the U.S. as refugees from Nazism during the New Deal era of the 1930s, a time of extraordinary openness to social-democratic thinking. While the critical theorists of Max Horkheimer's Institute of Social Research—Lazarsfeld's fellow exiles at Columbia University—have become known to intellectual historians as the chief antagonists of twentieth-century consumer capitalism, the émigrés I consider in this project became the unlikely avatars of European-style social democracy in the "free enterprise" culture of American business. They interpreted the research methods, pedagogical techniques, and urban values they had acquired in a social-democratic cultural context for the American system. Their socialistic Weltanschauung was fundamental, I argue, to some of their most important works in the U.S., including the suburban shopping center, the "focus" group, and a new Bauhaus school of design in Chicago.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sounding Spirit is conducting optical character recognition (OCR) of printed music books included in its pilot digital library. The digital library utilizes the Readux platform, which draws on textual and positional information in OCR to transparently overlay text on digitized images. Sounding Spirit's corpus presents challenges for conducting OCR including the juxtaposition of text and music, and complex layouts impacting line segmentation and reading order. Additional challenges include accommodating varied approaches to representing OCR in the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) manifests that Readux employs. This presentation provides overviews of Sounding Spirit and Readux, describes the results of a study of six major OCR engines, and details recommendations for OCR research drawing on our experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This moderated panel discussion shares perspectives on inter-institutional digital collection building in American music. Using the Sounding Spirit Digital Library, an open access portal featuring sacred American songbooks published between 1850 and 1925 as case study, panelists will describe the impact of this collaborative planning and production process.  Specifically, panelists will address 1.) why this collection of texts matters to the study of American music, 2.) the value of disseminating dispersed collections through a single point of access, and 3.) the significance of digitization and access options for stewards and scholars of American music.   Drawing on a white paper authored for a 2019–20 NEH planning grant, our discussion about Sounding Spirit will describe the digital library's technological and musicological interventions. The collection features texts associated with spirituals, gospel, and hymn singing that document  cultural exchanges across race, class, gender, and geographical boundaries. Our panel discussion will explore the processes through which inter-institutional partners formulated the collection's scope and digitization workflow.  Panelists represent the project's advisors, editorial staff, and archival partners; four leading collections of southern sacred music: Emory University's Pitts Theology Library, the Center for Popular Music at Middle Tennessee State University, the John Jacob Niles Center for American Music at the University of Kentucky, and Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Panelists will share insights gleaned about public and scholarly engagement with American music collections, proposing this project's approach as a model for other collaborations that can enhance teaching and research with previously inaccessible American music collections through digital library curation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>MIPoPS and RiceCapades present an update of the DVRescue project at AMIA 2019 annual conference in Baltimore. Description:  DV videotape formats face an exceptional obsolescence risk. Falling in-between professional expertise in file-based digital preservation and analog videotape digitization, DV tape are best preserved by migrating the data from the tape into a file rather than handling them as a video digitization event. This panel will review the work of a project responsive to the status of DV, called DV Rescue. The DV Rescue project is funded by the NEH in order to research DV preservation and to create new tools to facilitate the efficient transfer of data from tape to file. The presenters will show early models of their work, research conclusions, and methods to troubleshoot DV capture and preservation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing on their successful model of faculty professional development in global education and experiential learning, the presenters will lead participants through an overview of their workshop series. Participants will begin the process of identifying key stakeholders on their own campuses who could help develop and support an interdisciplinary professional development program to improve global education. Participants will leave the session not only with a workshop model that they can bring to their own campuses but also with a preliminary plan to develop and implement a program that meets the needs of their own institutions and that draws on their institutions' unique resources.</Abstract>

	</ConferencePresentation>
	<ConferencePresentation ID="17470">
		<ApplicationNumber>PW-259067-18</ApplicationNumber>
		<Abstract>This presentation will highlight a historic radio program from the collection of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) at the University of Maryland, which was digitized as part of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, and is now being developed by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) the Wisconsin Historical Society, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison into an online resource by virtue of an NEH-funded grant entitled Unlocking the Airwaves: Revitalizing an Early Public and Educational Radio Collection. The presentation will feature a highlight from a radio series (Document: Deep South), specifically a 1954 program entitled Mississippi Manuscript, which covers the importance of waterways, including the Mississippi River, with a representative from the Army Corps of Engineers in Memphis analyzing the river's ‘Jekyll-and-Hyde behavior.' The program also gestures towards inherent racial tensions in the U.S. southern economy, including the largely black labor force at shipyards, and how pioneers' initial use of waterways were informed by/affected by the necessity of navigating ‘Indian hostility.'  The Unlocking the Airwaves project's aim is to virtually reunify the NAEB's audio programs with newly digitized paper materials held at the Wisconsin Historical Society. The emerging resource will allow researchers to discover media materials ‘in context,' alongside accompanying textual documents. This presentation will include a brief demonstration of the application and highlight what materials are able to be displayed alongside Document: Deep South, including other materials about waterways and/or the environmental impact/history of the U.S. Southern economy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session features eight (8) of the sixteen (16) humanities scholars who participated in the June 2018 Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) at the CUNY Graduate Center and who now form a national network of distributed DH institute leaders. Additionally, GC Digital Fellows Patrick Smyth, Jojo Karlin, Olivia Ildefonso, and Javier Otero Peña and Digital Scholarship Librarian Stephen Zweibel will demonstrate the open access DHRI curriculum and explain how you can use it to jump start your own local institute. After a brief welcome by Project Director Lisa Rhody and Institutes Coordinator Kalle Westerling, the session will break into 9 simultaneous "lightning" presentations followed by questions at stations around Salons 2 &amp;amp; 3. Presentations will be repeated 5 times, allowing conference attendees to circulate among multiple stations. Around the room, there will also be stations with headphones to view the interviews with DHRI community leads (also found below) who were unable to attend the ACH conference. GC-based DHRI faculty and fellows will be on hand to answer questions. The session will conclude with a large-group question and answer period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session should particularly benefit faculty members and organization leader—i.e. working-class professionals with careers in creative industry—in need of learning how to engage their audiences with issues of race and ethnicity. Any faculty member in their own discipline can learn strategies of addressing race and ethnicity in courses outside social justice or cultural studies. This poster session presents a curricular map with new course initiatives and primary sources for art and design curriculum, as a model, addressing issues of race, ethnicity, transnationality, social justice, and LGBTQ. The project planning took place in the 2015-2017 school years, as FIT Art History professors Dr. Kyunghee Pyun and Dr. Amy Werbel developed and introduced new courses in Asian American and African American art. Now professors of design and business got involved to implement elements of race and ethnicity in historicizing current affairs. In the process of developing and teaching these classes for the first time, professors and students began to discuss the importance of labor history in understanding the careers of many Asian American and African American artists. This example can be modified and replicated in any other fields such as hospitality, human services, medical services, psychology, ecology, and more.  [199 words]</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I argue that through the labor studies of economic equality, immigration policies, social activism, and global trade, students and faculty will understand themselves as part of a greater historical context. Long-term, faculty will retain this knowledge and new educational resources to incorporate labor perspectives into all standard courses of art and design.  Between 2015 and 2017, 46 small or mid-size galleries, reputable in the field, went out of business in New York while demand for contemporary work has risen five-fold since 2000. Despite growth in the total amount of sales, only 25 artists are responsible for almost half of all postwar and contemporary art auction sales. In 2017, work by this small group of elite artists sold for a combined $1.2 billion—44.6 percent of the $2.7 billion total generated by all contemporary public auction sales worldwide. Teaching the reality of business in contemporary art is not easy. Historical precedents and contemporary practices are traceable in primary sources, but students rarely relate them to their own future. Project-based learning initiatives with in-depth interviews with artists in their studios are designed to address issues such as changing conditions of primary and secondary markets; demise of small or mid-size galleries; rise of public art; growing business expenses; choices made by artists as alternatives to a gallery system; amending a standard gallery contract; transformation of an artist's careers; monopoly of few giant galleries; demographic changes of collectors; and other crucial perspectives. 360 videos of artist studios scattered around New York City's boroughs were produced to engage students with work conditions of professional artists of our own time. In this presentation, Pyun presents mini projects she developed in order to move forward immersive learning initiatives related to business and labor history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A century ago, Bauhaus was an experimental and innovative group of design instructors and students. The school became a modern art movement characterized by its unique approach to architecture and design. Although not much is known about business operations of Bauhaus, the school's philosophy emphasized solidarity among industrial workers. Fashion Institute of Technology received a federal grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for three years to manage a project entitled "Teaching Business and Labor History to Art and Design Students." For two years, Dan Levinson Wilk and Kyunghee Pyun, co-PIs of this project have hosted faculty seminars with participating professors of multidisciplinary fields such as Business Management, Production Management, Interior Design, Illustration, Graphic Design, and Fashion Design. This paper presents pragmatic and philosophical problems of presenting Bauhaus in a typical survey of art and design and why Bauhaus is still an important case of business history relevant to art and design curriculum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I describe my ongoing research on African North Americans who crossed the U.S.-Canada border after the Civil War. While I have not found many narrative sources, I have found many data points of African North American migration. This presentation will describe ongoing efforts to visualize and analyze this data using government documents, geo-location scripts, and Tableau visualizations and the role of a New York Genealogical and Biographical Society Labs grant, my colleague Dr. Musa Jafar, and our undergraduate students in this research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In our session at NYU Gallatin, I will share some of my initial writing, as I work to frame the project and begin analyzing my archival finds and writing in earnest. I am particularly interested in discussing how to consider the question of color, passing, and pre-existing advantages for some African North Americans, before they crossed the borders; the interplay of economic, family, and political motivations for African North American border-crossing, against the background of the far larger number of white North Americans crossing these borders; and the general lack of knowledge about this generation in both the United States and Canada.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I have built a database to map migrations, geographic clusters, and kinship networks. Tracking individuals from census to census has been difficult, particularly if their color or race was not noted or perceived differently by different census-takers; some were wary of using their real names or did not know their ages; and some moved frequently, in the upheaval of the American Civil War or Reconstruction. Current systems are unable to record or search for the existence of a person without knowledge of their name (e.g., with a fuzzy identifier such as "he has a brother that was a sailor"). To date, we have identified about 10,000 families of these African North American border-crossers—but, as we clean and refine the data, we are finding many false positives as well as many missing individuals.  In our database in progress, we have been matching individuals across the U.S. and Canadian censuses, and then tracking and visualizing the patterns of migration and the nodes of social, professional, religious, and educational networks for African North Americans in New York and Ontario via analysis in Excel and Tableau, with a SQL database in preparation. Once we have linked records, we propose using geographic-information-system (GIS) and network analysis tools, including Gephi, MapStory, and "geo-Gephi" layout programs, to visualize the connections between African North Americans and their routes of migration, as well as a system based on a system of uniform identification to track African North Americans in disparate archival and census data.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, hundreds of African North Americans returned to fight for the U.S. Army, and thousands more returned to the United States in the decades that followed. Time in Canada gave African North Americans the power of comparison: When struggling for access to social and political participation and economic opportunity in the United States, these individuals had a reference point in British North America (Canada), a similar but distinct Anglo-American society with a different history of slavery, emancipation, and claims for equal rights.  This paper places African North American political actions, economic choices, and cultural arguments within a transnational context, placing their migration among the more familiar stories of African Americans. It suggests a new understanding of the source of political and cultural currents in U.S. history from the beginnings of the Underground Railroad to the death of the emancipation generation (roughly 1830-1920), including for prominent leaders such as Martin Delany, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and Mifflin Gibbs, as well as for nearly unknown figures traced in fraternal, church, veterans', and educational records.  This paper outlines the importance of the idea, as well as the reality, of Canada for these African North Americans, and then considers why the aftermath of the well-known Underground Railroad history has received so little attention.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>U.S. Civil War pension files were applications to a quasi-judicial board, authorized by Congress to gauge the level of disability among veterans, and to find and document their dependents. Filled with notarized depositions and medical examinations, the files were evaluated by civil servants whose conclusions could be appealed within the Pension Bureau, changed by Congress, or challenged in the courts. The examiners made their decisions according to unwritten rules of evidence—but the record shows how often their findings were influenced by overlapping strictures of racism, classism, and Victorian morality. The fuzzy standards at play are especially evident in the pension files for African North Americans—those of African descent whose lives were redefined by spending time on both sides of the U.S.- Canada border before, during, and after the American Civil War—who fought in the U.S. Colored Troops. Crossing and re-crossing the border, often with family on both sides, the African North Americans had experience in two similar but distinct Anglo-American societies, with different histories of racism and the struggle for equal rights. This paper analyzes the lives revealed in African North American "contested widow" pension files, where multiple women filed competing claims to be a deceased soldier's spouse. The rulings turn on questions of proof: in the competing narratives of these women, and in the doubts of the pension officials, what standards of evidence should apply? What assumptions about human nature can be made, when documents are missing? These files reveal cases of alcoholism, infidelity, depression, and deceit, but they also suggest the complexity of race, law, standards of evidence, and memory in transnational lives constructed under two legal systems.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Though stories of the Underground Railroad fascinate the public, the history of those crossing the U.S.-Canada borders after 1861, in either direction, has not received much scholarly attention. This essay is drawn from a book project on the emancipation generation of African North Americans—those who were alive at the time of the final U.S. emancipation in 1865 and who made a border crossing. The majority of African North Americans were illiterate, and only a few of the most prominent individuals left significant papers. To follow the movements and actions of African North Americans, I have pursued traces within Civil War pension files and the U.S. and Canadian censuses. In the Civil War pension files, veterans (or their survivors) describe their needs, submit to medical examinations, and provide documentation about their character, family structure, employment, and migration histories, often through depositions. Tracing the connections between those deposed, across pension files, reveal the networks of veterans and their families, across the international border. And, while U.S. Census forms ask no questions about temporary residence in another country, finding those African North American children marked as born in Canada in the U.S. Census allows me to track migrations, geographic clusters, and kinship networks. This project argues that recovering the networks of African North Americans can reveal transnational allegiances and the evolution of the U.S.-Canada border regions, from the era of U.S. Reconstruction and Canadian Confederation to the start of the Great Migration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Addressing music notation segments is central to many kinds of musicological discourse; references vary in scope and precision, such as "the measures two and three" or a more generic "the timpani in the opening bars of the Overture".

		<Abstract>Jane Addams's 1909 book, The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets, is puzzling in some ways. James Weber Linn, Addams's biographer, writes, "Of all her books [it was] the nearest to her heart" (178). But why? Even the analogy upon which the book's argument rests sounds odd: Working class youth can serve the same function of vitality and renewal for themselves and adults, as the arts currently serve for the middle and upper classes. To explain the analogy and show why it spoke so powerfully to her readers and herself, I will set the book in context and show how Addams constructed the analogy using then current theories of child development and aesthetics. While these theories are now out-dated, the book can still serve as a model for interdisciplinary investigations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For generations, Black communities of the South Pacific have struggled against environmental racism. Across the region, slavery, "black birding," genocide, political incarceration, sexual abuse, stolen generations, police brutality, whitening, violence, colonialism and ecological devastation were household names as common as breadfruit, sandalwood, canoes and cassava. From the 1960-80s, Black women across captured lands such as Australia, Aotearoa, Fiji, Vanuatu and New Caledonia battled these scourges through Black Power, decolonization and women's movements. In struggle, they raised arms, consciousness, rifles, liberation flags, families, questions about gender, spirits, instruments, solar panels, farms, cups of kava, resources, deities, voices and pens alike.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In the 1970s, Pacific nuclear testing struck at the heart of these issues. In giving birth to deformed "jelly fish babies," Black women felt the full weight of the crippling effects of radiation exposure. In 1975, they responded via the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific Movement (NFIP). NFIP clearly recognized the connections between colonialism and ecological injustice—the jellyfish baby makers tested nuclear weapons in the region because colonized Black people populated it. As such, the region could only become environmentally healthy by regaining political sovereignty. Evoking the name of a Tongan war club, NFIP's newspaper Povai became a regional voice for decolonization. While forging relationships with counterparts across the Atlantic and Indian worlds, these freedom fighters were harassed and subjected to intense surveillance. Their experiences and critiques of feminism are critical to understanding Africana ideas about liberation, the environment, mothering and sovereignty.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Pauulu's Diaspora is focused on Black Power, decolonization and environmental justice in the South Pacific (1960-1970s) through the experiences of Roosevelt "Pauulu" Browne. An ecological engineer from Bermuda, Browne was critically involved in indigenous political struggles in the Pacific and the spread of Black Power, inviting Black activists from the region to Atlanta's Congress of African Peoples (1970) and Tanzania's Sixth Pan-African Congress (1974). Across southern hemispheric archipelagos and crossroads, Browne forged relationships with artists, exiles and activist scholars. Ships, airports, villages, immigration depots, planes, buses, railway stations and street corners served as dynamic hubs where boundaries of race, power, class, colonialisms, identity, nationalisms, gender and ethnicity could be intensified and transformed. "Pauulu's Diaspora" shows how these mobile metropoles and travel spaces have historically functioned as dynamic sites of knowledge production, political transformation and Diaspora creation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Placed side by side, James's A Pluralistic Universe and Addams's Twenty Years at Hull-House seem to have little in common. James's critique of absolute idealism is written for intellectuals comfortable with philosophical abstractions. Twenty Years is full of stories about the lives of poor people and immigrants. Yet the two book echo each other. I will give a reading of Twenty Years as a presentation in real time of James's pluralistic universe, with both form and contents conveying the "essential provisionality" of experience in James's "strung-along" universe. I will then show how in Twenty Years sympathy and memory serve as wires upon which the universe is strung.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Italian opera in the late nineteenth century increasingly became identified in the United States as a musical-theatrical option that was elite and exclusive, especially as the nouveau riche of the 1870s and 1880s embraced opera as an opportunity for the ostentatious display of wealth. Middle-class Americans—who had happily and regularly patronized opera performances from the 1840s through the 1860s—were increasingly alienated by these "aristocratic" pretentions. The American prima donna Emma Abbott recognized this when she returned from Europe in 1876 following several years of musical training. Thoroughly educated in the Italian school of operatic performance in Milan and Paris, Abbott realized that many middle-class Americans still wished to support opera in English, and she decided to address that need. She created a public persona that resonated with the American public: as a moral and upstanding Christian, an apple-pie and approachable American from the heartland (with roots in Yankee New England), and a singer who gave her audiences what they wanted, which was the Italian repertory in translation, performed well but unpretentiously, and offered at affordable prices. The astonishing success of her company (1879-1891) is a little-known but important story of the creation of a middle-class audience for continental opera in the United States that helps us to understand better American musical culture (in general) during the 1870s and 1880s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Most Americans of the 21st century think of opera as musical theatre for snobs: expensive, exclusive, elite.  But in the 1880s there were American singers who fought this image and mounted English-language opera as popular theatre. Emma Abbott, a native of Peoria Illinois, was the most successful. She was trained in Italy but returned home to sing in English because, she said, "that's what the people want."  Abbott used her family's deep New England roots, her "girl-next-door" persona, Yankee characteristics of pluck, hard work, and determination, and desire to please her audiences to sell opera as American popular entertainment. And she succeeded wildly: known as "the people's prima donna," she was the 19th century equivalent of a rock star. She died a multi-millionaire in 1891.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk is an examination of the rich operatic cultural exchange between the United States and Great Britain during the late nineteenth century. My focus will be a little-known English-opera movement that flourished in America during the second half of the century, starting with the revival of English opera in the immediate post-war period. Significant changes in the American opera audience (as a direct result of the economic crisis of the 1870s) helped to set the stage for the significant English-opera movement that emerged in the 1880s, the heyday of English-opera performance in the United States. I will examine in some detail several important troupes, including the Caroline Richings, Euphrosyne Parepa Rosa, Clara Louise Kellogg, Emma Abbott, and Boston Ideals opera companies. The repertories of the final two troupes illustrate the two most popular strands of vernacular opera during the 1880s: the Abbott company performed translations of continental works (as well as some operas written in English); the Ideals relied on comic opera and operetta (in particular the extraordinarily popular works of Gilbert and Sullivan). These companies—and scores of other English-language troupes active in America during this period—featured singers (including Americans) who were active on both sides of the Atlantic; they also attracted non-elite middle-class American audiences with repertories that likewise represent a shared trans-Atlantic culture. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The late 19th-century American audience for Italian opera was increasingly identified with the wealthy, especially as the nouveau riche of the 1870s and 1880s embraced opera as an opportunity for the ostentatious display of wealth. Middle-class Americans—who had strongly patronized opera performances from the 1840s through the 1860s—were increasingly alienated by these "aristocratic" pretentions. The American prima donna Emma Abbott recognized this when she returned from Europe in 1876.  Thoroughly trained in the Italian school in Milan and Paris, Abbott realized that Americans yearned for opera in English, and she determined to meet that need. She created a public persona that resonated with the American public: a moral and upstanding Christian woman, an apple-pie and unpretentious American woman from the heartland (with roots in Yankee New England), and a singer who gave her audiences what they wanted: the Italian repertory in translation. The astonishing success of her company (1879-1891) is a little-known but important story of Italian-opera reception in late-century America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Texts propagate through many social networks and provide evidence for their structure. We describe and evaluate ef- ficient algorithms for detecting clusters of reused passages embedded within longer documents in large collections. We apply these techniques to two case studies: analyzing the culture of free reprinting in the nineteenth-century United States and the development of bills into legislation in the U.S. Congress. Using these divergent case studies, we eval- uate both the efficiency of the approximate local text reuse detection methods and the accuracy of the results. These techniques allow us to explore how ideas spread, which ideas spread, and which subgroups shared ideas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Texts propagate through many social networks and provide evidence for their structure. We present effi- cient algorithms for detecting clusters of reused pas- sages embedded within longer documents in large collections. We apply these techniques to analyzing the culture of reprinting in the United States before the Civil War. Without substantial copyright enforcement, stories, poems, news, and anecdotes circulated freely among newspapers, magazines, and books. From a collection of OCR'd newspapers, we extract a new cor- pus of reprinted texts, explore the geographic spread and network connections of different publications, and analyze the time dynamics of different genres.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bookworm, developed by the Cultural Observatory, is a tool that visualizes chronological trends in lexical usage within collections of digitized texts with metadata facets. The goal of this collaboration is to implement an enhanced open-source version of Bookworm that will enable culturomic exploration of the corpus of the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL), which represents a significant part of mankind's cultural legacy.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Project participants include developers of the Google Ngram Viewer. The HT+BW project applies a similar idea to the vast collection of digitized text in the HTDL. The HTDL's metadata is being leveraged for sophisticated trend analysis at a fine level of granularity.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The HTDL consists of materials from the holdings of some of the pre-eminent research libraries in the world, and currently consists of over 13 million volumes of digitized text, of which over 4.6 million are in the public domain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While large corpora of digitized books provide unprecedented opportunities for novel modes of scholarly inquiry, through computational analysis, into the cultural legacy of mankind as preserved in print media, corpora that include books that are under copyright and cannot be made available to scholars for computational analysis in bulk form, present a special challenge. A second challenge for inquiry in the humanities, is that the interface should provide scholars with tools for both distant and close reading. This panel will consist of four papers that present a complementary set of approaches to this problem, which, individually, provide scholarly users with interfaces to the text data along collection-centric, document-centric, and word/phrase-centric threads of inquiry into the corpus. The first paper will present the underlying cyberinfrastructural approach to this problem as embodied in the non-consumptive approach to scholarly research. The second paper will describe the collection-centric interface to the corpus via the notion of the workset, the customized subset of the corpus, which a scholar gathers, curates, and sustains through version management, and will conceptually describe the data model that can be operationalized into an architecture and interface to support worksets. The third and fourth papers will describe the HTRC-Bookworm and HTRC-Feature-Extraction initiatives, which represent word/phrase -centric and document-centric approaches, respectively, to interfacing with the corpus.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>XQuery provides an excellent means for teaching programming to digital humanists because it works seamlessly with their existing XML data, has an elegant and simple core with a well-structured standard library, and can be used in conjunction with XML databases to develop end-to-end web applications. However, current teaching materials for XQuery do not address the needs of digital humanists, presupposing implicit knowledge of programming concepts that they frequently lack. Based on experience teaching XQuery to digital humanists (including alt-ac professionals, archivists, faculty members, graduate students, and librarians) in three distinct settings: a weekly training session for librarians, a graduate seminar on digital humanities, and a two week NEH-supported Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities, I suggest how the XML community might develop resources to widen the appeal and accessibility of XQuery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Some of the earliest witnesses of biblical and related literature leave gaps of illegible text. Technological developments published this year demonstrate capabilities to recover text from erased or damaged manuscripts. In particular, it is possible to distinguish contrasts beyond the color range and precision of the human eye, including ultraviolet and infrared. Additionally, the texture of a manuscript can be mapped such that the corrosion of acidic ink on parchment can be read even if the ink is now missing. This presentation demonstrates the enhanced interactive digital copies of manuscripts now possible and raises the question of avenues for application.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation reports on the phase of the Jubilees Palimpsest Project dedicated to the integration of spectral imaging technology and reflectance transformation imaging technology (RTI). In 2013–2014 the National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities funded a collaboration of scientists and scholars of early Jewish literature to develop a method for integrating two previously successful technologies. The combination is greater than the sum of the sum of the parts because the data is fully registered, meaning each pixel represents the same location on the object across the data set. As the data set grows the possibilities for processing grow exponentially. The two technologies integrated capitalize on two features of erased manuscripts (palimpsests) that offer hope for recovery of textual information. First, the erasure of ink is typically not complete. The difficulty is more often in distinguishing the erased ink from the similar shades of brown surrounding it. Spectral imaging uses nine or more discrete wavelengths of light, both outside and more precisely within the color resolution of the human eye. This significant quantity of data can be processed and mapped to false-colors within the human range of color perception. The second area of hope for recovery of textual information from erased manuscripts results from the effect of acidic ink on the texture of parchment. Even if the ink has been entirely washed away it may be nevertheless be possible to distinguish where ink had been because of the rougher texture. RTI uses light reflected from many angles to identify the orientation of any one pixel, such that the texture of an imaged object can be visualized and enhanced in an interactive viewer. The integration of these technologies means that a scholar can see both the chrominance and texture features of an object at the same time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation is about developing and teaching an interdisciplinary course with support from an  NEH Enduring Questions award for a project that asks, ‘What is peace?  The course under development examines notions of peace in eastern and western contexts from ancient to modern periods with the ambition to push back against stereotyped images of ‘peaceniks.'  Nuances of its meanings conjoin with notions of justice, violence, human dignity, social and political order, tolerance, or their lack. Because our institution, the University of North Georgia, is one of six  senior military colleges, though with a majority civilian student body, answers to the question of  peace have pressing, practical, and current implications for economics, social justice, and global conflict.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many thinkers, including Descartes, Francis Hutcheson, and Henri Bergson have commented on humor's corrective function, especially where "small vices" or "mechanical inelasticity" are concerned.  Contemporary academics like, Rachelle Berg et. al., describe the therapeutic value of humor in "forming a therapeutic bond, addressing resistance, reframing maladaptive beliefs, and replacing rigid, self-absorbed perspectives" (2009).  Frank Lachmann has discussed the valuable place of humor in working with adults suffering from narcissism or self-pathology (2007).  These insights can be magnified when we examine the connection between humor and friendship, specifically the way that part of friendship is edifying confrontation.  Where there is confrontation, humor can have a unique power to persuade one toward a healthier way of living.  An incident in C.S. Lewis's work The Great Divorce demonstrates this power, while also showing its limitations.  Humor cannot guarantee or force a particular outcome; it is a tool of humble persuasion.  Finally, part of the value of humor's humble persuasion is how it honors wonder.  For those trapped in self-absorbed perspectives, narcissism, or any form of persistent willful blindness, humor's delightful invitation to wonder may free those who are trapped thereby.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In March of 2010, I was notified that I was a recipient of a National Endowment for the Humanities Grant given by the United States' government.  The grant is called an "Enduring Questions" grant.  It supports the development of a new course that addresses an "Enduring question."  My course addresses the nature of Pride, Humility, and the Good Life.  This presentation offers some of the fruitful results of teaching this course.  The presentation is divided into two parts.  The first part of the presentation includes a discussion of the content that we have explored in the course.  The course draws from classical authors like Homer and Virgil as well as other writers like Lao Tzu, Dante, Ralph Ellison, and Arthur Miller.  We also examine works by philosophers like Aristotle, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, and Buber.  In addition to this discussion of the course's content, the second part of this presentation will explore some concrete teaching techniques and tools that seem particularly valuable.  Those tools include a daily writing assignment called a QCQ, another assignment using Google Forms, a new approach to exams, and a scaffolded research project.  These unique, innovative teaching tools made the course content come alive for the students.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Both Willy Lowman and Michael Scott exhibit traits associated with secondary narcissism.  Both, though in different ways, have difficulty with empathy, problems distinguishing themselves from others, a hypersensitivity to insults, and are vulnerable to shame rather than guilt.  Both also exhibit flattery towards those they admire and who affirm them, use people without concern for the costs, brag, and pretend to be more important than they really are.  One of the ways that many of these traits come through is in their inability to hear others unless they are saying what they want to hear.  This presentation will explore how the structure (and outcome) of Death of a Salesman makes Willy's narcissism tragic, while Michael's parallel pathology is structure to seem comic in The Office.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man provides an excellent "cautionary tale" of the potential pitfalls of pride and humility.  When the novel is approached, pedagogically, in this manner, what comes to the fore are the various attempts to find some cause or core to which the narrator can submit wholeheartedly.  The narrator mentions humility in his graduation speech, and seems committed to the idea of obedient submission to a higher cause.  In the course of the novel, every cause to which he tries to submit proves to be flawed, including the college, Mr. Norton, his job at Liberty Paints, and the Brotherhood.  He rejects or is forced to reject all of these causes or cores.  His attempts at humble submission prove futile and dangerous.  In the course of his rejections, his various forms of rebellion could be linked to pride. The clearest example of this comes when he feels compelled to leave the Brotherhood.  When he attempts to leave, his lack of submission is branded as arrogance and pride.  Another connection between the narrator and pride is the hubris, in the original Greek sense, of his sexual encounter with Sibyl.  When the book is presented or taught in this manner, it outlines the dangers inherent in different aspects of pride and humility.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Architectural heritage represents the glorified past of the rich culture and architectural history of any country or community. It is important that the heritage be preserved and maintained for the generations to come so that they can learn from the heritage about their cultural identities as well as their architectural history. One of the essential approaches in preservation of architectural heritage is documentation of 3D geometries and surface textures of historical buildings. However, precise colour information, irrespective of lighting effects, which is an intrinsic property of the surface materials of building interiors and exteriors, has not been accurately documented in the scale of whole building surfaces, except for small sample areas. Every day the materials of historical buildings are decaying and their colours are fading. The goal of this project is to develop a method to assist in recording and documenting the intrinsic chromaticity information of building interiors and exteriors of architectural heritage with low cost and high efficiency. The method takes advantage of the emerging High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDRI) technology, which can store rich information about colour and illumination through digital photography. The significance of this research lies in that by recording the colour information, in addition to the geometry and texture information that can be obtained through other technologies, we can achieve more complete documentation for architectural heritage. In this paper, we present an overview of the problem and our effort of utilizing the advances in computer vision to document the colour information of architectural heritage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Shadows are the natural accomplice of objects. As such, they have affected various algorithms dealing with image segmentation, object tracking and recognition. A lot of research has been focused on removing shadows from images while preserving the information available in the shadow region. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust algorithm for cast shadow removal utilizing images taken at different times with different exposures. While different exposures allow good recovery of shadow regions, the time-varying feature is used to suppress the shadow edges.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digitised archival, museum, gallery and library content often lack metadata on the subjects within the image as the only metadata is for the source object. For example, the name of the author of the digitised book is known, but not that the image shows a bird. Crowdsourcing games allow this missing data to be captured through mass-participation with users describing what they can see. The integration of user-generated tags aids discovery of cultural heritage collections through the enhanced search terms provided. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Tiltfactor Laboratory at Dartmouth College has developed Metadata Games http://www.metadatagames.org as an online platform for gathering user-generated tags on photo, audio, and video collections. In tandem, the University of Edinburgh has developed its own crowdsourcing game to improve discoverability of its collections. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This presentation will discuss our experiences with crowdsourcing games including challenges encountered and workflows for integrating user-generated/folksonomic tags with authoritative data to aid discovery. Preliminary data will be presented illustrating the extent that user-generated tags enhance search at one's institution and increase traffic to online collections.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Finally, there will be information on how you can use metadata games to enhance the discoverability of your institution's collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The unique importance of Mary Moody Emerson has long been recognized, although her erstwhile reputation as Waldo's "brilliant" "Aunt Mary" has generally overshadowed her robust participation in a transatlantic literary culture sustained by the reading and writing practices of other antebellum women writers. Such women and their writings' gendered message of self-cultivation and civic engagement are currently transforming our understanding of the American Renaissance as a literary, social, and reformist phenomenon. Our subjects today are the digital tools that will enable established scholars and beginning students to gain access to and analyze previously neglected genres.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"A colored spiral in a small ball of glass, this is how I see my own life," writes Vladimir Nabokov in his autobiography, Speak, Memory. In our course "What is Memory?" we read and write with Nabokov's life story using our own form of Gregory Ulmer's "Mystory" mode of writing as a way to discover the life cycles of memories--ours and our students as well as those related by Nabokov--and to explore their tendencies to constellate around images, objects, and their metaphorical relations--the spiral, for instance. Following Ulmer, our Mystory is modeled after Roland Barthes' A Lover's Discourse. Like A Lover's Discourse, it is based on a "tutor text": A Lover's Discourse's tutor text is Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther; ours is Nabokov's Speak, Memory. Like A Lover's Discourse, our Mystory consists of a collection of "figures," short open-ended compositions in which we write with and after Nabokov, weaving our responses to the autobiography with our own and each others' memories, including autobiographical and collective memories as well as memories of other texts. This "weaving" process is supported by our use of SCALAR (http://scalar.usc.edu/), a multi-modal web-authoring platform, as the environment for our collaborative work. Coupling the responsive Mystory mode of studying a memoir to the collaborative SCALAR writing environment facilitates students' appreciation of the similarities between life writing and story writing, thereby also helping them to recognize the activity of remembering as itself a creative process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>(Disc)overing Race explores the intersections of digital history, geneaology, legal history, and computational technologies in uncovering the fragmentary histories of American families. Like oral histories and census records, legal records have long formed the archival substructure of the stories historians rely upon. Yet, legal records of the 19th century are often fragmentary---bits and pieces of the stories preserved in the official records---that must be supplemented with careful contextualization and related evidence. This paper explores the benefits and limitations of using computational approaches to categorizing, relating, and displaying these fragmentary records through an exploration of the O Say Can You See Project, an exploration of multigenerational black and white family networks in early Washington, D.C., that collects, digitizes, and analyzes over 4,000 case files from the D.C. court from 1808 to 1815. Attempting to document the relationships within and among black and white families in early D.C., the O Say Can You See Project offers novel ways to consider how we can interlink enslaved and free African Americans, as well as enslaved and white families through fragmentary records sources. This presentation focuses first on how digital tools allow us to tell multiplicities of histories that allow us to animate hidden, often fragmentary histories, of race, gender, and nineteenth century life and second on the multigenerational networks of families and their use of legal processes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An invited lecture entitled  "Oh, What does this button do?" Connecting Spaces, People, and Collections"  for symposium: Digital Interpretation: Screens and Devices as Didactic Media&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Recent innovations in digital display and interaction at leading institutions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, and Cleveland Museum of Art, have made it clear that digital technologies are now firmly established as part of the museum-going experience. These developments necessitate a critical and thoughtful consideration of how to deploy screens and devices in museum environments in a way that best supports the objects on display and the narratives that curators are conveying. This symposium will juxtapose the work of leaders in museum technology with efforts being made in the Bard Graduate Center's Focus Gallery Project to pose a variety of different approaches and models that engage with these new developments, and to open up discourse about the best ways to integrate digital technology in the interpretive and didactic missions of educational and cultural heritage institutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk explores why the tune Greensleeves became one of the most popular tunes in the Elizabethan period as well as of the anti-Interregnum period. The question is: how is that a broadside ballad expressive of forlorn courtly love (first registered in the Stationers' Company in the 1580s) became transformed into the voice of vicious, often scatological, political attacks against Cromwell and celebrations of the Restoration of monarchy? What makes the tune and context of Greensleeves so adaptable?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The multilingualism of medieval England was once highly occluded in the nationalizing conception of modern literatures and languages under which modern university disciplines were originally set up. French was supposed both to have suppressed English and then to have become ossified and degenerate in the late medieval ages, by being cut off from its 'national homeland'.  This paper looks at  medieval language acquisition and models of literacy, making the necessary distinctions between writing, reading and speaking in medieval language acquisition and models of literacy,and showing that late medieval women had important roles both in teaching, speaking and reading  French as well as being important commissioners and patrons of members of the clerical culture).   The oral culture of women, the use of French-language access in their primers and psalters and the linguistic phenomenology of late medieval French (in fact alive and changing) are one example of the continuing presence and importance of of French in later medieval England to set alongside other French-language practices in documentary and literary culture and suggest both the inadequacy of monoglot treatments of the vernacular and suggest some new cultural landscapes to integrate int our accounts of England's literate culture in the Middle Ages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Amidst continuing concern with Lollardy and heresy, recent attention has turned to the nuances and heterogenous nature of orthodox religious writing in England.  This paper deals with a neglected strand of such work: frequently owned by elite women and written in French, late medieval francophone devotion in England was free from the attention of medieval clerical censors and also largely free from that of modern scholars.  But there are large numbers of French-language devotional and thelogical texts composed and translated in England  and circulating there from abroad and they are by no means uninteresting or dull in their perceived orthodoxy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper begins with a look at the relationship between Gwendolyn Brooks and Richard Wright within the larger context of the Chicago Black Renaissance.  Drawing upon new and extensive archival research, the paper maps out what was distinctive about Chicago's literary culture at this time—especially in comparison to Harlem.  It tells a story of interracial collaborations supported by the Works Progress Administration, and explores the question of how black writers conceived of an audience for their writing, when they were dependent upon white publishers.  Ultimately the paper puts forth two claims:  that the art and literature of Bronzeville balanced the aims of social realism with the experimental forms of literary modernism; and that the Chicago Black Renaissance was a movement with its own distinctive energy even as it was informed by a set of aesthetic concerns characteristic to Chicago more broadly.  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Writers and artists discussed in the paper include:  Nelson Algren, Arna Bontemps, Gwendolyn Brooks, Horace Cayton, Jack Conroy, Eldzier Cortor, Ralph Ellison, Vivian Harsh, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Wayne Miller, Inez Stark, Gertrude Stein, Era Bell Thompson, Margaret Walker, Richard Wright.  &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The history of the lives after the Underground Railroad has not received enough attention. My current research considers those African North Americans who crossed the U.S.-Canada borders after 1861, in either direction. I have pursued research in family trees, at homecoming gatherings, in Civil War pension files, archaeology and the built environment, and the U.S. and Canadian censuses. This project argues that recovering the networks of African North Americans reveals the evolution of the U.S.-Canada border regions; the historical relationships between race, citizenship, national allegiances; and the motivations for international and interregional migration, 1860-1930.  I am researching the effect of repeat migration on the African North American communities throughout the Great Lakes (including Buffalo/Niagara Falls); in large cities such as Toronto, Washington, Boston, and New York; from the Eastern Canada maritime provinces; and from British Columbia. I have preliminary evidence that African North Americans were the leaders in the key Black organizations around the Great Lakes—churches, businesses, schools, labor unions, and fraternal organizations—when the Great Migration brought huge numbers of African Americans from the South to transform these communities. The research proposed here could determine whether African North Americans were more likely to lead these communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, hundreds of African North Americans returned to fight for the U.S. Army, and thousands more returned to the United States in the decades that followed. Time in Canada gave African North Americans the power of comparison: When struggling for access to social and political participation and economic opportunity in the United States, these individuals had a reference point in British North America (Canada), a similar but distinct Anglo-American society with a different history of slavery, emancipation, and claims for equal rights. This paper places African North American political actions, economic choices, and cultural arguments within a transnational context, placing their migration among the more familiar stories of African Americans. It suggests a new understanding of the source of political and cultural currents in U.S. history from the beginnings of the Underground Railroad to the death of the emancipation generation (roughly 1830-1920), including for prominent leaders such as Martin Delany, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and Mifflin Gibbs, as well as for nearly unknown figures traced in fraternal, church, veterans', and educational records. This paper outlines the importance of the idea, as well as the reality, of Canada for these African North Americans, and then considers why the aftermath of the well-known Underground Railroad history has received so little attention.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Currently involved with "Teaching Business and Labor History to Art and Design Students" funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the faculty conversations at Fashion Institute of Technology have generated much interest in realities and imaginations of careers in textiles and clothing manufacture. In the fast fashion trends represented by the H&amp;amp;M, Zara, and Forever 21 and the like, consumers are now more aware of ethical and environmental consequences as well as socio-economic injustices stemming from their purchases.   Labor strikes out of textile mills and clothing factories in the twentieth century have much studied in the context of labor organizations but not in the context of business history of careers in art and design. Some contemporary artists comment on the disappearance of artisanal villages or traditional communities in Southeast Asia or China. This paper will focus on three to four cases of contemporary art making with these communities by considering conscious or unconscious legacies of colonialism and imperial exploitation embedded in lives of these people. Artists to be included are Patty Chang (Route 3, 2011; 3-channel video installations collaborated with David Kelley); Kevin Beasley (Rebuilding of the Cotton Gin Motor II, 2016; installation); Jaye Rhee (Seasaw, 2003; 5-channel video installations); Do-ho Suh (Almost Home, 2018; immersive architectural installations).   The paper argues that visible or invisible realities of labor concerning textiles, sewing, repairing, audible noises, dusty air, and some music are inseparable in perception of some contemporary art practices involving rural and urban communities of garment workers and mass consumers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Entity recognition is a gateway technology for semantic access to ancient materials in the Digital Humanities: they allow users to discover resources about people and places of interest which they could not possibly read exhaustively, they facilitate linking between resources and projects and they provide a window into what a text discusses, even for datasets for which translations are not available. In this paper we explore entity recognition for Coptic, the language of Hellenistic era Egypt in the first millennium CE. We evaluate a number of standard Natural Language Processing approaches to the problem and lay out the difficulties in applying them to a low-resource, morphologically complex language. We present our own solutions for named and non-named nested entity recognition and entity linking, relying on a robust parsing strategy, feature-based CRF models, and some hand-crafted knowledge base resources, which enable high accuracy entity recognition with orders of magnitude less data than commonly used for NER. The success of the approach suggests avenues for research on other languages in similar settings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Just as understanding another person's perspective can help in one's own life, understanding one field of study results in a better understanding of the needs of the other field. In this paper, I discuss how work on language documentation and revitalization can inform studies of a language's history, and vice versa, drawing on my experience with Eskaleut (EA) and in particular of Unangam Tunuu (UT), formerly known as Aleut. On a project to document UT and create adult language learning materials, I had to describe UT morphosyntax in sufficient detail for language learners; in so doing, I discovered substantial heretofore unidentified differences between UT and Yupik/Inuit languages, such as in strategies for combining words, or for expressing causation. These, in turn, led me to investigate differences between Yupik/Inuit languages and UT more systematically, and to explore the possibility of prehistoric language contact as a source of these differences. In looking at borrowing patterns between UT and the neighboring Yupik language Alutiiq, I discovered gaps in the documentation of place naming strategies, making it difficult to establish the origins and meanings of place names, despite excellent collections of place names themselves, and despite community prioritization of indigenous names, including the creation of new names. This led me full circle back to documentation efforts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper considers what moral theory might contribute to an understanding of moral injury. Given that moral injuries often have debilitating consequences, it may seem that moral theorizing is beside the point. We argue, however, that moral theorizing is uniquely situated to establish the normative implications of instances of moral injury and the institutions in which they emerge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The danger of moral injury does not fundamentally change the moral calculus regarding of war. Moral injury may, however, generate reparations claims and may impact feasibility judgments just wars. We argue that moral injury represents a moral cost that must be factored in to decisions to fight but must also play a role in preparing warriors. We also argue that a concern for individual rights, accountability, and transparency permit returning warriors familiar with moral injury to use their authoritative testimony to impact public debates about the merit of military engagements.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent discussions of moral injury show the power and promise of the concept for understanding of the normative significance of trauma. Our research supports how the idea of moral injury helps many with its symptoms to understand their experiences. As the concept gains traction, however, it threatens to become overly inclusive. In this presentation we clarify the boundaries of moral injury by arguing that morality, injury, and agency are each crucial for moral injury. Reports of moral injury can then be mistaken. We set out the normative contours of moral injury as part of a project of distinguishing the phenomenon from other sorts of trauma and unwelcome experiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Building science gateways for humanities content poses new challenges to the science gateway community. Compared with science gateways devoted to scientific content, humanities-related projects usually require 1) processing data in various formats, such as text, image, video, etc., 2) constant public access from a broad audience, and therefore 3) reliable security, ideally with low maintenance. Many traditional science gateways are monolithic in design, which makes them easier to write, but they can be computationally inefficient when integrated with numerous scientific packages for data capture and pipeline processing. Since these packages tend to be single-threaded or nonmodular, they can create traffic bottlenecks when processing large numbers of requests. Moreover, these science gateways are usually challenging to resume development on due to long gaps between funding periods and the aging of the integrated scientific packages. In this paper, we study the problem of building science gateways for humanities projects by developing a service-based architecture, and present two such science gateways: the Moving Image Research Collections (MIRC) – a science gateway focusing on image analysis for digital surrogates of historical motion picture film, and SnowVision - a science gateway for studying pottery fragments in southeastern North America. For each science gateway, we present an overview of the background of the projects, and some unique challenges in their design and implementation. These two science gateways are deployed on XSEDE's Jetstream academic clouding computing resource and are accessed through web interfaces. Apache Airavata middleware is used to manage the interactions between the web interface and the deep-learning-based (DL) backend service running on the Bridges graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The emergence on the Inner Asian steppe of regional confederacies, states, and empires of pastoral nomads has figured prominently in the early historical records of China. To date, more than eighty years of systematic research on pastoral nomads has produced a substantial amount of data for understanding these mobile societies. Although this effort on the part of historians and prehistorians represents an impressive body of knowledge, relatively little attention has been devoted to anthropological models for complex socio-political organization among pastoral nomadic groups, despite the clear significance of nomadic peoples to civilizations in both the Old and New Worlds. In paper, I present a hypothesis-based research design to advance the understanding of regional nomadic complexity using as a case study the archaeology of Mongolia's first nomadic state, the Xiongnu polity (c. 3rd century BC). Employing the results of recent archaeological studies in 3 different areas of Mongolia, our research evaluates current competing models for the process of political integration that articulated central and local powerholders in the earliest phases of state building. Our research assesses hypotheses for decentralized and centralized state expansion derived from the historical and archaeological records. We argue that what was, at first, a core polity based on distributed authority became more centralized through the experience of integrating outlying communities. These two foundational formats of authority provided the mature Xiongnu state with the capacity to shift between more and less centralized leadership allowing for a more flexible form of regional polity. The Dornod Mongol Survey project (DMS) proposes to evaluate these ideas using regional pedestrian survey and excavation over a three year period at the site of Avargyn Ovoo in the southeastern Gobi desert of Mongolia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>(See "Supplementary Materials" for presentation slide deck extract)  The Mississippi Delta region in the southern U.S. is recognized as a nationally significant cultural geography and heritage tourism destination. In 1996, the National Park Service proclaimed it "the cradle of American culture," leading to its 2009 Congressional designation as the Mississippi Delta National Heritage Area (MDNHA). In 2012, the National Trust for Historic Preservation deemed it a National Treasure because "the Delta tells many of the nation's diverse stories" including the Blues and the Civil Rights Movement.    The Delta also is the poorest region in the poorest state in the U.S. Institutionalized systems of oppression, inequality, and racial violence against African American residents have produced persistent, generational poverty conditions. The Delta's renowned cultural heritage assets were created through African American experience. Yet, African Americans generally are not empowered to interpret their own stories, raising concerns about heritage tourism authenticity and representation.  The Delta Center for Culture and Learning at Delta State University and the MDNHA are inclusive, collaborative cultural heritage development catalysts in the region. Their interpretation programs have engaged African Americans in interpreting their own stories while promoting awareness and pride among all residents and visitors. This presentation examines how The Delta Center and MDNHA are strategically empowering African Americans to interpret their cultural heritage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper shows that the dramatic 1942 assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by Czechoslovak resistance fighters was little celebrated in the immediate postwar years. Its only significant commemoration took place in October 1947 at the church in Prague where Heydrich's killers met their end. The ambivalence of the assassination's postwar commemoration, the paper argues, is best understood not in terms of the usual categories of "memory" and "forgetting" but rather as an unresolved struggle over its contested meaning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After collaborating on several short films in the 1970s, Merata Mita gained international recognition for her feature films including "Patu!" and "Mauri." By the nineties, however, Mita returned to the genre of short-format documentaries that marked her early career, including "The Shooting of Dominick Kaiwhata" (1993), which examines the fatal shooting of a young Black Power member and the resulting miscarriage of justice that followed, as well as "Dread" (1996), which explores a small community of Maori Rastafarians on the North Island. Furthermore, Mita created these short documentaries for broadcast television, which has led to their exclusion from the canon of global Indigenous cinema – deemed the "fourth cinema" by Maori filmmaker Barry Barclay, and a body of work "outside the national orthodoxy" that Mita herself helped to establish.   Yet Mita's embrace of television as a platform to broadcast her politically engaged works in the nineties provided the necessary context for the establishment of Maori Television in 2004 – now a key site for the health and well-being of Maori language and culture in the face of the devastating effects of colonial settlement. By reconsidering fourth cinema as a mode of exhibition as much as it is a category of production, Mita's willingness to produce significant works for her community via television – instead of for exclusive exhibition at art house theaters – reveals one of Mita's key contributions to Indigenous film and media. That is, not only did she make the national airwaves more hospitable to Indigenous voices, she also demonstrated to Indigenous media-makers worldwide that working "outside the national orthodoxy" is not necessarily exploiting the globally circulating product of film, but perhaps embracing a locally based medium to cross (and redefine) the internal borders of the contemporary settler nation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Today, John Locke's contributions to American political thought are understood almost entirely in terms of his Second Treatise (1690). Prior to the Cold War, however, Locke influenced Americans in a variety of important, but hitherto underappreciated, ways. In this paper, I address a particularly interesting aspect of Locke's changing influence: late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century Americans' preoccupation with his involvement in creating a set of Fundamental Constitutions (1669) for the English colony of Carolina. I show that, against the political backdrop of the early national period, Americans exhumed Locke's unsuccessful attempt at drafting a constitution for Carolina and interpreted it as a striking example of the perils of governments born of abstraction rather than practical experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ernest Hemingway reached the height of his literary popularity within the Soviet Union during the Spanish Civil war. His literary works and war correspondence of this period were almost immediately translated into Russian and published in Soviet periodicals. Unlike the American Hemingway who was most often associated for western readers with 1920s Paris, bullfighting, and African safaris. The Soviet Hemingway was an ardent anti-fascist and supporter of Republican Spain. After all, this was the Spain of Mikhail Kol'tsov's Spanish Diary and the final romantic period of the world revolution, before Stalin's Great Terror could completely dampen that spirit. In this paper, I will elucidate the Soviet fascination with Hemingway during the period 1936-1940, when Hemingway seemed to experience his political awakening, seemed to move to the left and seemed to identify with the Communists as the only ones who could bring order to Republican Spain.</Abstract>

How do people communicate across cultures? In the Soviet Union the exchange of culture with the West was often fraught, especially when deciding who to acknowledge for the Soviet literary market. Soviet translators, scholars and critics were often the arbiters of which authors seemed to support Soviet policy. The papers in this panel proposal explore various aspects of this process of cultural selection.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Zola's Au Bonheur des Dames (1883), with its emphasis on the seduction, domination, and financial exploitation of women customers by male businessmen, has become a paradigmatic example of nineteenth-century commerce ("Mouret avait l'unique passion de vaincre la femme"). This paper questions whether accepting Zola's literary representation at face value has paradoxically reinforced for modern readers what was, in fact, a fantasy of gendered power dynamics. To what extent have Zola's powerful literary tableaux distracted modern readers from an even more threatening male consumerism that took place in small shops where the "vaincus" were not women, but male shoppers who squandered family finances as they succumbed to the temptation of enchanting displays?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Naduhup language family, located in northwest Amazonia, has four members: Hup, Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadëb, of which Nadëb is the most distantly related sister (Epps &amp;amp; Bolaños 2017). Despite a strong signal of cognacy in basic vocabulary, the four languages are highly divergent in their grammatical profiles and morphological forms – particularly so for Nadëb. This divergence probably has much to do with their diverse contact histories, and has likely been facilitated by structural properties that feed grammaticalization, such as noun incorporation and verb serialization. This structural divergence is clearly evident in argument marking across the four languages. In light of the diversity of its argument marking resources, the Naduhup family offers an intricate historical puzzle in its own right, which in turn provides insights into the diachrony of argument marking more generally. Despite their apparent recency, the historical sources of the core argument markers are not fully clear; however, those in Hup and Nadëb may represent an extension of directional and locational functions, respectively. For non-core arguments, the development of a more generic oblique suffix (-Vt) in Hup and Yuhup has probably been areally motivated via contact with Tukanoan languages (see Aikhenvald 2002 for a similar development in Tariana, Arawakan), and may derive from hut, a variant still attested in Yuhup. Similarly, Nadëb's development of pronominal subject-marking is a likely reflection of contact, involving Arawakan languages. Several postpositions show some evidence of cognacy across the family, while others may be innovations, although there is little evidence for non-adpositional sources. Finally, Nadëb has undergone a further historical stage in which the incorporation of a number of postpositions into the verb phrase has given rise to a set of verbal prefixes (see Weir 1986).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nadëb (Naduhup language family) stands out among other northern Amazonian languages for its large vowel inventory, which distinguishes ten contrastive vowels, at least seven of which contrast for length. The analysis of the vowel inventory has changed little since Helen Weir's (1984) initial work. Recent pilot fieldwork, however, has identified a new vowel contrast previously unaccounted for. This contrastive vowel is problematic with respect to our understanding of the Nadëb phonological system – it only manifests as long, while other vowels manifest as both long and short or only short, and consultants cannot identify a short equivalent. Moreover, preliminary formant analyses suggests that its central tendency is near-identical to that of another vowel, /??/; most words that attest this vowel are written as /??/ or /??/ in other works on Nadëb (Martins 2005, Barbosa 2005, Weir et al. 2011). The lack of an orthographic representation for this vowel is troubling for the community, who have an active bilingual school and prioritize an effective orthography. I propose that /?:/ is best analyzed phonologically as a long /?:/ (note that [?:] does not occur in contemporary Nadëb), which has raised and merged phonetically with /?:/, phonemically /?:/. Due in part to morphological patterns, speakers still perceive /?:/ and /?:/ as separate phonemes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What might research and the publication of results look like if scholars producing them integrated decades of theories about the construction of identities and the politics of knowledge production into their work on so-called historical or traditional arts of Africa? Mapping Senufo—an in-progress, collaborative, born-digital publication project—offers a model for joining such theories with research and publication practice. It focuses on arts identified as Senufo, one of the most celebrated styles of African art since the early twentieth century. The project reflects our commitment to taking seriously the long-established understanding that a marker of identity, like the labeling of an art style or knowledge itself, is historically constituted, fluid, and positional. In its final form, the open-access, multimodal publication the Mapping Senufo team will produce will exemplify the contingent nature of identities, art style labeling, and knowledge production. It will also harness the interactivity of digital environments to render readers active participants in knowledge construction. In this presentation, we will examine how our initial efforts to map geographic locations linked to objects labeled as Senufo led us and the rest of the project team to reframe research questions, reevaluate sources, and reimagine the form of a digital monograph. We will also demonstrate how our use of digital technologies and our collaborative mode of working have generated fresh insights into Senufo arts, art-historical research, and digital publication.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Pamela A. McClanahan, Digital Projects Librarian at University of Maryland Libraries and Project Manager for the Historic Maryland Newspapers Project (HMNP) will share research conducted on the Maryland newspaper collection from the Chronicling America newspaper database at Library of Congress. HMNP is the Maryland state awardee of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP), a partnership between Library of Congress and National Endowment for the Humanities, and selects and digitizes newspapers published in the state of Maryland to be included in Chronicling America. HMNP has been digitizing newspapers since 2012 and includes newspapers from throughout the state from the mid-19th to mid-20th century. There has been an emphasis on selecting diverse titles such as those representing political minority groups, labor groups, non-english language, immigrant communities, and the women's suffrage movement in the state. HMNP has been analyzing data from Chronicling America to better understand the Maryland newspapers including number of titles and number of pages by such factors as region of state and county, year published, ethnicity of community audience, language, and political leaning. Data visualization software is being used to provide a new way of looking at the collection. Not only will this help researchers to better understand and utilize the Maryland newspapers, but also assist HMNP with future selection decisions for digitization. While still in the beginning stage of this research, this poster will highlight the reasoning for this data analysis, share preliminary findings, and discuss next steps and considerations for further research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The core of Zimmerman's picture posits an inverse correlation between an action's automaticity and belief's role in the action's execution. This proposal faces serious problems. First, high-attention, high-control actions don't seem to heighten awareness of one's beliefs. Second, low-attention, low-control actions are caused by the same states at play when executing high-attention, high-control actions, in which case there is no ontological difference in the states involved in these behaviors. Third, on Zimmerman's view it is unclear what it is for a state to be involved in behaviors at all, as the basic realist response—that beliefs cause behavior—is unavailable to a Zimmerman-style pragmatist. Lastly, if Zimmerman's view were right and low-level behaviors weren't caused by beliefs, then we should turn our attention to those states instead, as most of our behavior isn't executed under conditions of high control and attention.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Belief storage is often modeled as having the structure of a single, unified web. This model of belief storage is attractive and widely assumed because it appears to provide an explanation of the flexibility of cognition and the complicated dynamics of belief revision. However, when one scrutinizes human cognition, one finds strong evidence against a unified web of belief and for a fragmented model of belief storage.

		<Abstract>Propaganda is all around us, and has been for a long, long time.  As such, it might seem like the current scare about propaganda is a bit of a parochial moral panic. In this talk I address two questions: 1) Is propaganda inherently bad, so bad that we shouldn't engage in it? And 2) Is the problem of propaganda getting worse? I bring relevant results from cognitive science--both classic and brand new--to bear on these questions, which turn out to be intimately related. In the end, I suggest that we are in a particularly peculiar moment, one that is truly different than any other in history and causes a special type of sui generis Epistemic Chaos.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What is the most parsimonious model of the mind? Historically, associationism has played this role, positing one mental process (the ability to associate, e.g., Ideas, or stimuli and responses) and one sort of structure (mere associative links). By using the simplest model possible, associationists gain a rhetorical edge by having parsimony on their side. But being so bare-boned has its consequences: a truly parsimonious associationism cannot account for more contemporary "associative" models. Thus modern "associative" models end up being no more ontologically parsimonious than their rivals. In which case associationism faces a dilemma: either it is truly simple, but also descriptively inadequate, or it is not ontologically parsimonious and thus is no better off than rival theories which posit propositional structure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Arts and humanities have often been an afterthought in STEM education. Developments with STEAM (Art), STREM (Reading), and STEMM (Music) have tried to address this by adding arts and humanities into STEM to increase problem solving, innovation, or creativity. This supplement leaves out many of the soft-skill development that arts and humanities provide. In a change of this approach, the Honors College at Texas Tech University has developed humanities-driven STEM courses that use arts and humanities as the basis of discussion of human progress and supplements with STEM principles through scientific discovery and engineering advancement. These courses have been instituted within a first-year experience program. Analysis of these courses and discussion of student and instructor feedback will be provided.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Some Mixtec varieties of the Coastal dialect group (Josserand 1983) are relatively vital and have been documented and described, whereas others are not. One of these, Tu'un Savi, or Tututepec Mixtec, is spoken by relatively few people and has not been well-studied, even though history suggests it may have been influential in the past. The town of San Pedro Tututepec is built on the former capital of the Mixtec-speaking Yuku Dzaa empire that controlled much of the coastal region of what is now Oaxaca from the Late Post-Classic period until after the Conquest (Spores 1993). This paper presents a brief sketch of Tututepec Mixtec as represented in historical and archival sources with an eye to identifying traits that distinguish it from other Coastal Mixtec languages that are more prominent in the literature. In particular, evidence will be shown pointing to Tututepec Mixtec sharing more features with Chayuco Mixtec (Pensinger 1974)  than with other nearby Mixtec languages such as Jamiltepec and San Juan Colorado Mixtec (Johnson 1988; Stark, Johnson &amp;amp; Lorenzo 1986). These sources include a wordlist (Belmar 1902; Sullivant 2015) and responses to linguistic surveys undertaken in the 1970s (Josserand n.d.). This sketch of Tututepec Mixtec will identify phonological, morphological, and lexical traits of the language that will be useful for the study of the historical development of the Mixtec languages and variation across the Coastal Mixtec languages.  It is hoped that this initial sketch made possible by studies of previously collected by underanalyzed data will draw attention to this language and its position in the constellation of Mixtec languages of the Coastal group and possible historical influence across Oaxaca's Pacific coast. This work has the potential to bring attention to the Tu'un Savi speech community of Tututepec and may spur further research on this language or other languages it may have been in contact with it historically.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sounding Spirit is a collaborative research lab and publishing project that demonstrates the importance of sacred texts to the singers and communities who shape American music history and experience. This sectional will highlight the impact and legacy of five significant tunebooks in the Sounding Spirit series: Cherokee Singing Book (1846); The Story of the Jubilee Singers with Their Songs (1875); Class, Choir, and Congregation (1888); Soul Echoes, No. 2 (1909); and Original Sacred Harp (1911). These volumes represent periods, places, and genres that illustrate the importance of vernacular songbooks to American sacred music. These tunebooks also document dynamic encounters among white, black, and native communities whose singing and worship are often represented as discrete. In addition to sharing selections from these songbooks, Sounding Spirit editor-in-chief Jesse P. Karlsberg will co-present with the project's volume editors on the significance of gospel, spirituals, and shape-note songbooks to both the history and practice of sacred song. Participating volume editors include senior scholars and worship leaders Drs. Meredith Doster (Emory University), Sandra Graham (Babson College), Kevin Kehrberg (Warren Wilson College), and Sara Snyder (Western Carolina University).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Intertextual Networks is an initiative of the Women Writers Project (WWP) at Northeastern University aimed at exploring and theorizing the representation of intertextuality, with a focus on the citation and quotation practices of the authors represented in the WWP's digital collection, Women Writers Online (WWO). The WWP's work on Intertextual Networks incorporates several strands: focused projects conducted by individual research collaborators; sustained examination of the modalities of intertextuality as revealed by the work of our staff and collaborators; and a large-scale encoding project creating a bibliography of all the texts named or quoted in WWO, linking the texts in that bibliography with their occurrences in the WWO corpus, and substantially expanding the encoding of intertextual phenomena in our textbase. In this paper, we will discuss the aims and methods of the project, offering models for encoding complex intertextual features and setting out some processes for the systematic application of additional markup to an existing corpus. We will also consider the implications of this project for the larger ecology of digitized collections focused on gender and on women's writing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Arch-V (short for Archive Vision) is a newly developed C++ application that provides image based search capabilities for digital archives of print materials. In 2013 the English Broadside Ballad Archive (EBBA) at the Early Modern Center, University of California, Santa Barbara was awarded an NEH Start-Up Grant to begin work on the Ballad Impression Archive (BIA), a component of EBBA specifically devoted to cataloguing the over 9,000 (and growing) individual woodcut impressions in EBBA and making them fully searchable as an image collection. A key component of this award was the creation of software to provide automated, image based searching of the collection.  The proposed short paper will introduce and provide an overview of the implementation procedures for Arch-V.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Shirine Hamadeh considered how Ottoman space, or spaces, were constructed through studies of 17th century Aleppo and 18th century Istanbul, respectively.  She discussed how one could write early modern architectural and urban histories, when the existing sources have so few images representing architecture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The former Ottoman world is home to many communities of Muslim religious minorities that have been variously deemed heterodox deviants from the acknowledged schools of Islamic law. Narratives about them have focused on a certain impurity or syncretism in their religious practices. One such group is the Kizilbash/Alevi community of Anatolia. From the perspective of Ottoman rulers and statesmen, Kizilbash groups were often seen as politically dangerous heretics to be stamped out, or at the very least reformed. With the rise of ethnic Turkish nationalism, another offshoot of this narrative emerged, which posited Alevis as stewards of the pre-Islamic spirituality of Turks from Central Asia. These disparate narratives shared a focus, not on who the Alevis were, but rather why they were not proper Muslims.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Yektan Turkyilmaz presented his work on the conflict in Eastern Anatolia in the early twentieth century and the memory politics around it.  He shows how discourses of victimhood have been engines of grievance that power the politics of fear, hatred and competing, exclusionary claims to statehood and territory by Turks, Armenians, and Kurds. Grounded in extensive archival research in American, British, Turkish, and Armenian historical repositories, Türkyilmaz traces how discourses of communal victimhood were generated around the traumatic ordeals in the two decades that preceded the Armenian genocide of 1915-6, carried out by the Unionist government. Türkyilmaz's work pays special attention to the nature of political tension and debate among Armenians on the eve of the genocide.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Bogac Ergene explores how the Ottoman legal system, institutions, and practices changed during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Recently, Ottoman historians have intensified their efforts to better understand the socioeconomic dynamics and fiscal-administrative structures of this period. Once considered to be an era of general decline and degeneration, now the prevalent tendency in the field is to characterize these two centuries as an era of major institutional transformation and adjustment to new circumstances. These novel attempts of interpretation are based on impressive archival research and nuanced considerations of the information that this effort has generated in social, political and economic history. However, the progress achieved in these areas has yet to be attained in legal history-writing. Broadly speaking Ottomanists have yet to provide a comprehensive depiction of the ways in which Ottoman law, legal institutions, and practices might have changed between 1600 and 1800. This paper represents a preliminary attempt in this general direction, by offering a critical survey of the available literature and considering how historians approached and discussed legal structures and practices during this period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The NMC's Horizon Report, created with input from many AAM members, has helped museums and universities set priorities for technology planning, research and practice since 2010 (go.nmc.org/hzmu). The 2014 edition adds new sections that outline implications of each trend for policy, leadership and practice. Panelists will introduce topics from the 2014 report and lead a moderated discussion about how museums can anticipate and react to these coming changes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This  paper  examines  moments  in  early  modern  English  texts  in  which  a  male  to&amp;#x0D; female (MTF) cross-dresser, while passing as female, commits acts of violence, or has&amp;#x0D; violence done upon him. The fictional MTF cross-dresser's role in violent encounters&amp;#x0D; reveals the gendered nature of that violence. In some cases, moments of cross-dressed&amp;#x0D; violence  have  the  capacity  to  secure  the  sex-gender  system,  because  they  show&amp;#x0D; cross-dressers to be "real men," no matter how well they pass as women; at the same&amp;#x0D; time, though, because many of these cross-dressers do pass as women, violence by or&amp;#x0D; toward them is read as female violence. Though they are often violent or potentially&amp;#x0D; violent, men dressed like women are also major targets for violence and harassment.&amp;#x0D; The paper also considers at the punishment rituals of Skimmingtons, which penalized&amp;#x0D; men's  private  gender  transgressions  through  public,  shameful,  and  often  painful&amp;#x0D; forced cross-dressing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>MW2015 Professional Forum 9 (Got Tech? How Small-town Museums and Historical Societies Can Go Digital) explores local, place-based digital projects within state, national, and global frameworks.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Community pillars and repositories of history and memory, many museums are struggling the face of an ever evolving technological landscape. Consultants for local museums have commented that small museums "lack all of the new technology platforms" and as a result these museums will "most likely fall further behind the industry and become less relevant to the intended audience." By looking at recent digital initiatives from across the country, this panel highlights ways in which museums can use this opportunity to not only jump on the digital bandwagon, but also reach a new and larger audience. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Smithsonian Institution, the Center for Public History + Digital Humanities, and the Florida Humanities Council are a few of the national and statewide institutions that are partnering with small town museums and historic sites through new digital initiatives. We discuss twenty-first century solutions for museums and historic sites by examining interactive experiences that explore how we can leverage current collections/resources and thus highlight the pivotal role these institutions can play within the larger community.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; J. Mark Souther's presentation, "Local as Global," introduces the NEH-funded digital humanities project "Curating Kisumu" and draws preliminary lessons for small museums from his experience leading a mobile app development project in collaboration with a university in Kenya.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At a time when monsters were readily available at Bartholomew Fair, Southwark Fair, and even minor street events as well as in coffee houses and taverns in London, what was it about a hog-faced woman that spurred a flurry of print? Was it her extraordinarily monstrous appearance? Probably not. Tannakin Skinker was a woman with the face of a pig, but a broadside depicting two monstrous pigs, one with hands instead of front hooves had been chronicled by Sir John Hayward in 1562. And while pigs have particular biological similarities with humans (early dissectors such as Vesalius often used them as substitutes for humans due to the similarity of their internal organs), the particular conjunction of details that make Skinker compelling are those that make her the perfect emblem for monster-culture of the seventeenth century. Thus, Tannakin Skinker becomes a positive center for previously marginal figures. Her story both has elements of the old flag of monstrosity in its didactic origin while also heralding a new kind of open signification in its secular, comic, literary and economic elements.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Discussing the "resuscitability" of information in new media networks in a recent Critical &amp;#x0D; Inquiry article, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun asks: "Why and how is it that the ephemeral endures? And what does the constant repetition and regeneration of information effect? What loops and what instabilities does it introduce into the logic of programmability?" My essay draws from these questions, alongside the investigations of new media and pop cultural theorists, to ask how the repetition and regeneration of early modern short forms of English literature have their own "logic of programmability." Theories of the diffusion of digital memes can inform our understanding of the proliferation of early modern short forms on all levels of the cultural spectrum, from courtly sonnets to popular ballads. The use of new media theory to analyze the dissemination of early modern short forms offersthe potential for further insight into what generic attributes are defined in sonnets or ballads and how they are propagated by the continued production and circulation of these short forms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation will discuss an assignment developed and employed at the speakers' institutions that uses a social-networking site to allow students to perform the roles of characters in early modern dramatic texts. Each student creates a social-networking profile for a single character in an assigned play and then throughout the semester interacts with the other characters in the digital environment, basing that character's "performance" on textual evidence. The pedagogical benefits of using this digital tool include lessons about character formation, the realization of close-reading skills necessary for such formation, and the implementation of new-media-supported performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Barnabe Googe's Eglogs, Epytaphes and Sonettes (1563) is a notable work in literary history for being the first single-author collection of short poetry by a living poet. It has also been notable for its typographic oddities, particularly its practice of splitting pentameter lines in two. Thus, though "sonnet" is in the title, none of the poems seem to fit the formal requirements of that genre. However, as was noted long ago by Hoyt Hudson, at least two of the poems are in fact sonnets—and Shakespearean ones at that. They had gone unrecognized because the iambic pentameter lines were split into alternating lines of two and three feet, making twenty-eight line poems instead of the sonnet-standard fourteen. Those scholars who discuss these line breaks have tended to explain it as a simple typographic matter: there was not enough space on the page for the pentameter lines, or Googe simply carried over the practice of splitting fourteeners into lines of four and three feet to his pentameter lines. There is another agent to consider, however, and another tradition of poetry that bears on this typographical oddity: the printers Ralph Newberry and Thomas Colwell and the broadside ballad. Both printers had produced broadside ballads—Thomas Colwell quite regularly—and broadside ballads tended to avoid lines longer than quatrameter. In fact, breaking fourteeners into lines of four and three feet result in one of the most common ballad measures. This paper explores the connections between Googe's Eglogs and the broadside ballad and argues that rather than making a fairly arbitrary typographical choice in breaking the pentameter lines, Newberry and Colwell may have been considering potential readers. Shortening those lines would make the slender collection of poetry appeal to a wider range of readers, and thus increase their chances turning a profit.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Library of Virginia and the Virginia Foundation of the Humanities are partners in publishing content from the Dictionary of Virginia Biography and other LVA projects and collections on VFH's website Encyclopedia Virginia. In 2012 the DVB and EV  received a three-year NEH grant to fund the partnership's current project, Freedom to Disfranchisement: The African American Experience in Virginia, 1861–1902, which tells the story, through biographical and topical entries, of African American agency and challenges from the Civil War and the beginnings of freedom and citizenship to the legislated reversal of those rights by the Virginia constitution of 1902. &amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D; In this session Mari Julienne and Matthew Gottlieb will discuss and demonstrate the content created for the project, including previously published and new biographical material from the Dictionary of Virginia Biography, as well as topical entries on emancipation and Reconstruction in Virginia, organizations and movements that gave rise to an African American professional class, race riots and lynching, politics and voting in late-nineteenth-century Virginia, and the state's first public school system. To engage users in the historical complexities and details of this period, Encyclopedia Virginia is more than an aggregation of written essays. Taking advantage of the digital format, EV expands the story through the inclusion of images, maps, primary source documents (with transcriptions), and other historic artifacts. Biographical entries are also linked to each other and to Encyclopedia Virginia's topical and thematic entries to provide a richer context for learning and research than possible in the traditional print medium.</Abstract>

She surveyed projects from the DH2005 conference and found that just 53% of digital projects were still online and accessible, a startlingly low number. As libraries and archives address digital preservation problems, scholars who do digital work must be invested in preserving their past and current work, too — or we run the risk of losing an entire strata of scholarship.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the spring semester of 2012, I received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to design and teach a course devoted to this question: ‘What is the value of a liberal arts education?' My goal in this paper is to talk about this experience in three different phases: I) discussing the grant with faculty and staff at my institution; II) teaching the class; and III) thinking about the meaning of the liberal arts in the context of higher education today. The thesis that I hope to advance in doing so is that faculty need to justify a liberal arts education based on its intrinsic value and not on its practical value. It is common today to tout the skills that students develop from studying the liberal arts. They learn skills in critical thinking, reading, writing, and speaking, and these skills are necessary in any profession. But many courses outside the liberal arts and humanities teach students skills. It thus becomes necessary, in my judgment, to find the intrinsic value of a liberal arts education. My goal in this paper is to make such a case.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will explore ephemera in British America: its use at the time and its standing now in holdings and collections. Blank forms (single-sheet printing with spaces for handwriting, such as legal forms, indentures, lottery tickets, and so forth) were the bread and butter of colonial printers. Beyond this business interest, how were they valued then and now? Blanks were made to be used: marked up, folded, docketed, torn. This intentional destruction gives pause to the cultural historian interested in questions of value. Yet their role in contracting individuals to the agreed-upon matters involved in the blank form suggests a haunting power in their moment. In book history circles, job printing and blanks have undergone a revitalization of sorts in current scholarship. How might this revitalization challenge literary scholars or how might we reorient questions of value in the worlds of both literary study and textual studies? These will be some of the ideas raised in the talk [ed. note: Jim, you could add to the end of this sentence "drawn from my book project *The Novel and the Blank: Thinking with the Print Shop in British America*"]</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In comparative work on Eastern and Western conceptions of the self, contrasting differences are often primarily emphasized. While there are important differences to be noted, there are interesting and important commonalities as well, the recognition of which can help foster cross-cultural education and scholarship. I will survey representative differences and commonalities across Eastern and Western conceptions of self, with emphasis towards a pluralistic understanding of self-knowledge that can stimulate cross-cultural dialogue and interdisciplinary collaboration in research and the classroom. Some attention will be given to relevant historical figures and viewpoints (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Buddhism, Confucius, Zhuangzi, Descartes, and Hume), though I will focus in particular on converging overlap between Asian philosophy and developments in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation to a panel sponsored by the Ralph Waldo Emerson Society at the annual conference of the American Literature Association focused on two of the eventual features of our digital edition that we expect to enrich scholarship and teaching: 1) the ability to view the text to display substantive differences between Waldo's transcriptions of Mary's Almanacks and her original text; and 2) the ability to create multiple page orders, both within a given folder and across multiple fascicles, thereby enabling readers to create multiple new "editions" of the Almanacks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presentation at the first conference of International Cross-Currents, held at Martin Luther University in Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Born in Concord, Massachusetts on the eve of the American Revolution, Mary Moody Emerson (1774-1863) was a self-educated scholar and author who is most widely known as the brilliant aunt of Ralph Waldo Emerson. In her writings, Mary Emerson anticipated her nephew's work and published her own pseudonymous essays. Her most significant literary accomplishment, however, is a series of unpublished manuscripts she called "Almanacks" (c. 1804-1855). Spanning over fifty years and one thousand pages, these documents feature characteristics of the spiritual diary, commonplace book, and epistolary essay and demonstrate the ways in which early American women adapted traditionally "masculine" genres and subject matter, demonstrated their literary artistry, and engaged in emerging public spheres.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>WorldMap is an open source and open access online platform for visualizing and sharing spatial data. It has attracted considerable use since released in July of 2011.  The Center for Geographic Analysis at Harvard University is currently working on enhancing the WorldMap platform to make it easier for the world to find and use a key class of interactive maps called "map services" which are hosted by servers around the world, including WorldMap itself.  Currently estimated in the millions, there is no complete index for such services. This work allows users from any online mapping application to be able to search for and use these map services as interactive map layers. The objective is to make it possible for everyone to see the development of human civilization in all its diversity and complexity in spatial contexts, to take advantage of the knowledge of others to enhance our own interests, and to create a sustainable and scalable platform in which students and scholars can participate in creating and sharing any work that can be represented spatially.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Harvard's Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) is engaged in an NEH-funded effort to address the problem of map service discovery by extending the information gathering and search capabilities of an existing map publishing platform, WorldMap. The goal is to build a registry of all known map services and make it available it available via a public query API. WorldMap users will use this API to find layers in WorldMap and to find layers outside WorldMap. External layers that are used within WorldMap will accrue usage statistics which will be used to improve search. Uptime statistics will be gathered on all remote services to attempt to address the problem of the ephemerality of map services. Within WorldMap, feature level information will be used to improve search. A faceted interface will be provided which will include a layer footprint heat map of all search results even when results are in the millions. Any map client outside WorldMap will have access to the API to use to find and bind to all available map services.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>MapReduce-type approaches using Hadoop have been explored for solving sets of computational problems that were previously too large for traditional GIS systems to handle. Three cases are introduced in this study to demonstrate the implementation of this approach. Case one (funded by NEH): Hadoop is used for crawling the web for map services. It enables us to farm out work to many processors in parallel, making search against 5 billion web pages relatively manageable.  Case two: Hadoop is used to enable researchers to query, analyze, and subset large spatio-temporal datasets containing billions of records. This is demonstrated on global geo-tweets collected over one year. Case three: Hadoop is used to divide up and process calculations of network and straight line distances between thousands of points in New York City over a seven year period.  The total number of distance calculations required for this project is 3.5 billion. What these projects have in common is all can be broken down into many separate, discreet processing tasks where the output of one task does not influence the output of another.  This kind of problem, amenable to a "divide and conquer" approach, is the kind of challenge Hadoop excels at.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This breakout session will explore some of the ways in which theatre and other forms of narrative-based live performance have been used to represent contemporary examples of transnational migration to the United States.  Special attention will be paid to racial and ethnic minorities, undocumented migrants, and refugees and asylum seekers.  Each panelist will discuss a different theatrical methodology as it has been used to engage the migration experience.  Methodologies will include: interview-based verbatim theatre, oral history, solo performance, adaptation of literature and other non-dramatic texts, and community based theatre.  This breakout session grows out of a National Endowment for the Humanities Institute on theatre and immigration that will be held at San José State University in July 2014. http://immigrationtheatreinstitute.org.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper focuses on the nationalist, often bellicose, use of Dante to support claims to "unredeemed" Italian territory on the eve of the Great War, and the appropriation of the poet as a symbol of Italian nationhood on the eve of Mussolini's rise to power. To highlight Dante's role in the cultural formation of Italian identity leading into and during the ventennio, I discuss materials ranging from battleship "Dante Alighieri" and D'Annunzio's interventionist speeches to scientific reports worshiping Dante's exhumed bones and political propaganda deifying Il Duce as the poet's prophesied veltro come to save Italy. Just as Dante's body fueled nationalist fervor at the advent of fascism, so his mortal remains helped sound the regime's death knell: with the war lost and the Republic of Salò on the verge of collapse, Alessandro Pavolini, the party secretary, proposes gathering fascist leaders and soldiers at an alpine retreat, and to have Dante's bones brought there from Ravenna so the movement can go out in a blaze of glory alongside the remains of the "massimo simbolo di italianità."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Enhancing Music Notation Addressability is a one-year project that investigates methods for addressing arbitrary portions of encoded music notation on the web. By "addressing" we mean being able to refer to, or cite, a passage of music in order to make a statement about it. This could be considered a virtual equivalent of "circling" some music notation on a printed score. Michael Witmore (2010) has argued that text is a "massively addressable object"; that is, given certain abstractions and conventions, it is possible to identify areas of a text such as characters, words, as well as chapters or proper names. Compared to text, music notation is more complicated to represent digitally. Human-computer interaction has since its early days been built around the concept of character and line, which makes dealing with "plain" text a fairly straightforward matter for many basic operations; counting the number of characters in a given plain text document is trivial in any digital environment. Music notation, however, requires substantial computational modeling even for the simplest musical text before any further operation is possible. There are, indeed, many ways of representing a single note; some aspects are common to all representation systems, such as information about pitch and duration, but some systems will prioritize certain aspects over others.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This poster will show the technical specification created by the EMA project. The specification aims at defining a scheme for addressing a selection of music notation regardless of its representation. The expression is based on simple units that are commonly represented by music notation systems for common western music notation, such as measure, staff, and beat. The expression is formulated as a URL, which makes it possible to target resources on the web.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many social evolutionary theorists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries considered sympathy as a primitive instinct of gregarious animals and assigned sympathy a central role in human social evolution. I will examine how Addams's use of sympathy in her ethics was based in the era's evolutionary science. Like many scientists, she regarded sympathy as a primitive instinct and a primary factor in human social evolution. Unlike others who segmented the civilized from the primitive and denigrated the latter, Addams used the sympathetic instinct to bridge such divisions.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the past five years, the Women Who Rock (WWR): Making Scenes, Building Communities Oral History Archive has been staging, teaching and archiving conversations between women of color in punk and hip hop scenes in the U.S. and beyond. Women of color feminist epistemologies and queer of color theorizing are the guiding forces of the project. WWR brings together scholars/archivists, musicians, media¬makers, performers, artists, and activists to explore the role of women and popular music in the creation of cultural scenes and social justice movements in the Americas and beyond. The project encompasses several interwoven components: project-based coursework at the graduate and undergraduate levels; an annual participant-driven conference and film festival; and an oral history project hosted by the University of Washington Libraries Digital Initiatives Program that ties the various components together.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>By conservative estimates, several hundred thousand poems appeared in early American and U.S. newspapers from the eighteenth through the early twentieth centuries. Counting snippets of verse that appeared in death notices, advertisements, and articles makes the presence of poetry in historic newspapers even more pervasive. Feminist scholars and others performing recovery work routinely resurrect authors and works from newspaper pages, but until recently this rich trove of newspaper verse as a corpus of its own has been outside the scope of literary study and a footnote in histories of American newspapers. In the last decade, however, scholars have made significant inroads in studying the importance of newspaper verse as a form and the public role of poetry in American culture. Underpinning this scholarship is a growing recognition that the evaluation and history of American poetry should not be based on less than one percent of the poetic record. In addition, this new scholarship values and explores the role of poetry in the daily lives of people, including making sense of what it means to be human and in processing national, social, and individual experiences. To the extent that these new histories depend on traditional methods of archival discovery and analysis, however, they will remain anecdotal— individual narratives extrapolated from a miniscule subset of the whole, with limited means of situating the anecdote as either representative or idiosyncratic. In short, the magnitude of the corpus requires new modes of discovery and analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite content seemingly irrelevant to Byzantine political life, the two treatises On Staseis and On Invention from the late antique Hermogenic corpus seem to have been studied regularly in the Byzantine classroom. Their archaic language and difficult subject matter may incline us to presume that the two treatises would have been studied "from the book," that is, the material would have been delivered lecture-style by the teacher and absorbed by the students by means of note-taking. This probably was the case – but not exclusively. The approach assumed in the Byzantine commentaries and scholia on these texts exhibit three distinct oral features: dialogic orientation, symmetry and chiastic structure, and repetition and rhythm.  These features suggest that practical argumentation training proceeded orally, by means of memorization and informal interchange among students.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Byzantine commentators of the Hermogenic corpus insist that the enthymeme, a unit of informal argumentation, is related to the Peripatetic rather than the Stoic syllogism. This attitude is generally taken to suggest that the Byzantines regarded the enthymeme as an incomplete syllogism with one explicit and one implied premise. However, a careful analysis of the enthymematic examples offered in the Hermogenic commentaries reveals that the Peripatetic syllogism was preferred as a model for explaining rhetorical argumentation because it uses terms unrelated to each other. When converted to rhetorical enthymemes, the syllogistic terms receive emphasis by means of syntactical parallelism as well as stress-based rhythm, thus transforming the syllogistic structure into a figurative unit of argumentation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My paper draws attention to the understudied local culture of genealogical documentation practiced among the Ismaili pirs and khalifas of Badakhshan. My intention is not to mine the documents as sources for the historical appearance of Nizari Ismailism in Badakhshan, about which we still have limited knowledge, nor to assert the validity or prove the deficiencies of ‘ilm al-nasab in Badakhshan. Rather, using nasab-namahs from Zebak and Ishkashim in Afghanistan, together with interviews and informal genealogical writings preserved as copies by khalifas and their descendants in the 20-21st century, it is to explore the nasab-namah/shajarah genre as a system of knowledge, a source of confessional identity and authority, and a textual tradition that reflects socio-religious connectivity across the writing cultures of the Pamir and Hindukush in regions often considered to be geographically-bounded zones of cultural hegemony. This study is a small part of a larger collaborative project on the genealogical history of Ismailism in the eastern Islamic world, the first stage of which is the completion of an open access digital repository of 65 documents from Badakhshan in Tajikistan and Afghanistan in the Princeton University Library Digital Repository (Digital PUL). This collection is based on an archive of photographs of privately-owned genealogies compiled by me during field research conducted in Tajik and Afghan Badakhshan between 2004-2019. The second stage of the project, a co-authored book manuscript on the collection, is currently in progress, for which I seek to further extend the study of Ismaili genealogical documentation to Chitral, Gilgit and Hunza in the Hindukush.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Outside the Sufi silsilah tradition, genealogical cultures of documentation in the Persianate world have not yet been subject to serious critical analysis as have those in the Arab world. My research seeks to bring attention to one such Persianate tradition – that of the nasab-namah/shajarah-namah tradition among the Isma?ilis of Shughnan, Badakhshan. This documentary genre was particularly well developed in 19th century Badakhshan in present-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan, although extant genealogies date back as early as the 16th century. Among the categories of genealogical histories are those of Ismaili foundational figures (lineages of pirs, shahs, khalifas and qadis). This paper will focus on the genealogical tradition of Sayyid Mu?ammad I?fahani (known as Shah Kashan), who in written and oral tradition is represented as one of four missionary figures that traveled from Khurasan to Badakhshan in the 16th century. In contrast to Shah Malang, from whom the Isma?ili pirs of Shughnan Badakhshan trace their descent, and Shah Khamush, from whom the shahs of Shughnan trace their descent, the textual genealogical tradition associated with Shah Kashan traces the sayyid descent of the qazis and khalifas of Shughnan Badakhshan through him to the imams and the Prophet Muhammad. Using five documents dating from the 16th to the 20th century, my paper will: 1) explore the elements of formulaic language, shared terminology, and physical features of the documents and what they tell us about the intentions and the mode of textualization prevalent in the region of Shughnan; 2) analyze the genealogies from the points of view of Ismaili lineage construction and historical context.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is an abstract from the "Crafting Culture: Thingselves, Contexts, Meanings" session, at the 84th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology.  At first the two ideas of this paper's title can seem contradictory, but as three separate words they come together. What is the valency between the hypothesised solidity of an archaeological place and the stream of events that go into making it, transforming it, and erasing it? The ephemeral nature of the archaeological sites created by mobile communities is often the first thing that is said of them and after that comes a long chain of strictures limiting what interpretations are possible. Here I propose a more positive outlook. Using case studies from the Eurasian steppe this paper will search for seemingly ephemeral places and find them as assemblages of many materials. Of primary interest to this discussion will be more mobile subjects ranging from sheep to metals and less mobile ones like stone or drainages. The subject here is not site location models, but an exploration of how places are crafted by the knowledge and action of many actors both ancient and modern.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The need to provide science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learners, particularly engineers, with an understanding of humanities is becoming increasingly apparent. Continued globalization through technologies means that what engineers create has an impact on how we communicate within/across societies. Humanities and STEM education are currently siloed, limiting the connection between topics and fields. However, links between the humanities and STEM can deepen students' educational experiences. Exploring the links between STEM and humanities, the Texas Tech University Honors College has developed an interdisciplinary curriculum incorporating the arts and humanities and STEM. Unlike other iterations of this technique, namely STEAM, where arts are included to help promote more creative, innovative problem-solving, this approach uses the humanities as the foundation for STEM learning. We coin this approach Humanities-Driven STEM (HDSTEM). HDSTEM education goes beyond creative thinking and problem-solving, providing soft skills through application of the humanities. Our paper focuses on the development of empathy, one soft skill. Specifically, discourse analysis was used to examine course assignments that ask students to reverse engineer technical dilemmas from World War II. In some instances, students were asked simply to reverse engineer; in others, they were asked to consider broader, contextual, humanitarian concerns during WWII. Results show development in empathetic language, such as emotionally evocative terms, attention to societal aspirations, and human-centric focus over more abstract problem-solution oriented thinking. We believe this illustrates a definite link between empathy development and technical problem-solving.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For most of the 17th century, the middle Rappahannock River valley (Virginia) served as a refuge for Native communities displaced from neighboring river drainages by an aggressive and expanding English settlement. A limited documentary record suggests that these relocated communities interacted in ways that reshaped Native tribal identities in the face of this settler colonialism. In 1608, as many as eight polities made their home in the lower Rappahannock valley. By the end of the century, documents refer to only two: the Nanzatico and the Rappahannock. But what does the archaeological evidence suggest about these interactions and these reconstituting communities and identities? This paper compares types and distributions of selected materials recovered from a number of 17th- and early 18th-century Native settlements in the middle Rappahannock, finding considerable variability among assemblages. This variability is an important key to understanding Native responses in an occupied homeland.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The spatial turn in the humanities is sending archaeologists and their Native colleagues back into the documentary, oral history, and archaeological records to tease out elements of the indigenous cultural landscape – in the deep past, in the colonial past, and in the present. Ceremonial landscapes are an important part of the indigenous landscape: they are mentioned in documents and have been reported archaeologically, typically as ossuary or other mortuary contexts. Increasing the scale at which these places are considered reveals relationships not immediately evident at the site level. This presentation describes these examples, shows how Geographical Information Systems can be used to build a greater context for their interpretation, and suggests how GIS is forging new directions in the study of the indigenous cultural landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The color, texture, chemical properties, and depth of soil – what archaeologists call stratigraphy – have the potential to reveal information about past human activity at a site. If recorded carefully and systematically, stratigraphic descriptions can reveal how long a site was occupied, the presence or absence of features, suitability for farming, landscape modification, and how the people who lived there used the ground around them. Analysis of soil descriptions recorded for shovel test pits excavated at the Baylor Site (44EX0005), a post-Contact Portobago/Rappahannock hamlet, provides insight on both historic and contemporary landscape and land use.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The archaeological study of migration and human mobility is enjoying a bit of a revival. Once used to identify so-called archaeological cultures to explain cultural change and then later altogether ignored, migration and other forms of human mobility have always played an important part in the construction of social life. The Rappahannock River Valley provides a  microcosm of the movements taking place in the Middle Atlantic from late prehistory through colonization by Europeans. This paper uses artifacts recovered from new fieldwork and existing collections to explore mobility, interaction networks, and practices of craft production in the lower Rappahannock valley in an effort to represent the social and geographical dynamism of this region.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Lithic materials have long been traditionally examined artifactual categories that archaeologists have used in the reconstruction of North American indigenous lifeways. This article paper examines the lithic artifact assemblages from two Early to Middle Woodland sites of in the Rappahannock River Valley of northern Virginia; Port Micou and Westmoreland Berry Farm. Each site contains a wide variety of diagnostic lithic tools and stone types which potentially suggest the presence of Indigenous migrants and inter-regional trade routes within the Rappahannock River Valley. Non-local stone types including Metarhyolite, Carolina Slate Belt rhyolite, Greenstone, and Orthoquartzite are all found in abundance within these two sites and suggest the Rappahannock valley's prominent position within the Middle Atlantic's lithic exchange system. Additionally, this article will examine the spatial distribution and temporal distribution of lithic projectile points and debitage at Port Micou and Westmoreland Berry Farm.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Late Woodland and Protohistoric Periods witnessed the rise of politically complex native societies in the Chesapeake region. Powhatan's regime is the most famous and studied example, while peripheral areas like the Rappahannock River have attracted less attention. This paper specifically explores the nature of societal organization in the Rappahannock River Valley using archaeological evidence from the Rappahannock River Valley Survey and earlier investigations. Assemblages analyzed  include ceramics, oyster shell, lithics, and prestige goods from   sites along the river. By comparing temporal and spatial distributions within sites and across sites, this paper documents the population distribution, exchange networks, and social stratification of the indigenous societies along the Rappahannock River in an effort to understand their political organization.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent archaeological surveys and cataloging of curated collections recovered along the Rappahannock River by the research team at St. Mary's College of Maryland have led to new interpretations and understandings of the Indigenous Cultural Landscapes of the river valley. One such new finding is focused on the long term and intensive use of Native-made tobacco pipes into the last quarter of the 17th century. The continued production and consumption of such pipes so late into the colonial period is striking in comparison to other river valleys in the Chesapeake region. In this paper, I will discuss archaeological and historical sources of evidence for Native pipe making in the region, examine specific motifs and decorations of tobacco pipes recovered along the Rappahannock River, and discuss these phenomena in relation to the unique historical-cultural context of the 17th-century Rappahannock River Valley.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Indian Neck, the ridge of land that defines the boundary between present-day Essex and King and Queen counties, is the center of modern Rappahannock tribal life. "The Neck," as it  is known, was also the location of a Rappahannock reservation after they were dispossessed of their pre-invasion homelands along the Rappahannock River circa 1667. While much is written about the 17th- to early 18th-century Rappahannock indigenous landscape, equivalent documentary records and accounts are scarce throughout the 19th century. It is by using oral histories of the Rappahannock people in conjunction with census, land, and tax records that the dynamics of the Indian Neck neighborhood are explored.</Abstract>

My perspective here comes from my experience co-directing an NEH-funded, intensive, 2-week summer institute for K12 educators in 2018, which will be held again in June 2021 as a virtual program. "Remaking Monsters and Heroines" focuses on teaching Frankenstein and Cinderella through adaptations, with the goal of helping students produce their own adaptations as a form of critical engagement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In traditional Tunisian healing practices, one of the most common diagnoses is affliction by water spirits (ba?riyya). A wide variety of ritual healing musics feature songs dedicated to these water spirits, as well as the saints, such as Sidi Bu Sa‘id el-Baji, who are believed to control them. The praise song (nuba) for Sidi Bu Sa‘id called ra'is el-ab?ar (captain of the seas) is found in numerous healing and devotional musics, providing a shared reference for musics associated with a diversity of communities, including healing traditions of women (such as the mannubiyya), the Jewish community (rebaybiyya), and even drinking parties of laborers (mizwid). In this paper, I examine this song in relation to the cultural "work" of the silsila ("chain"), a flexible musical form that provides a sonic inventory of the saints of the local devotional landscape. In doing so, I explore the Jewish-Muslim convergences that defined the rebaybiyya tradition, the trans-Mediterranean (Tunis-Paris) traffic in musicians that nurtured it, and the faint traces of those collaborations and movements that remain in the Tunisian devotional musical landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Tunisia, trance rituals animated by praise songs to Sufi saints are not exclusive to members of Sufi orders or participants in Sufi ceremonies. Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, those of women, Jews, blacks, and hard- drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical "journey" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community. This paper emphasizes the important role of women and minorities in cultivating Sufi aesthetics, and shows how Sufism resonates throughout Tunisian society via listening publics associated with numerous genres of music - both "sacred" and "secular" - that evoke the spiritual and therapeutic power of music and trance. Based on ethnographic research between 2009 and 2015, this presentation takes as its starting point the changing politico-religious climate after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 and the concomitant threats to the survival of musical practices associated with Muslim saints.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Today's digital libraries consist of much more than simple 2D images of manuscript pages or paintings. Advanced imaging techniques – 3D model-ing, spectral photography, and volumetric x-ray, for example – can be ap-plied to all types of cultural objects and can be combined to create complex digital representations comprising many disparate parts. In addition, emer-gent technologies like virtual unwrapping and artificial intelligence (AI) make it possible to create "born digital" versions of unseen features, such as text and brush strokes, that are "hidden" by damage and therefore lack veri-fiable analog counterparts. Thus, the need for transparent metadata that de-scribes and depicts the set of algorithmic steps and file combinations used to create such complicated digital representations is crucial. At EduceLab, we create various types of complex digital objects, from virtually un-wrapped manuscripts that rely on machine learning tools to create born-digital versions of unseen text, to 3D models that consist of 2D photos, multi- and hyperspectral images, drawings, and 3D meshes. In exploring ways to document the digital provenance chain for these complicated digital representations and then support the dissemination of the metadata in a clear, concise, and organized way, we settled on the use of the Metadata En-coding Transmission Standard (METS). This paper outlines our design to exploit the flexibility and comprehensiveness of METS, particularly its behaviorSec, to meet emerging digital provenance metadata needs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A new algorithm for volumetric segmentation that produces high-quality segmentations of the pages of a manuscript is presented. This approach replaces the current segmentation method of the virtual unwrapping pipeline and greatly reduces the effort and time required of a user. The algorithm is applied to extract pages with clear ink signal from micro-CT scans of the M.910 manuscript. Future applications of this algorithm, particularly its ability to generate training data for a supervised machine learning algorithm that fully performs segmentation automatically, are also discussed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Any good educator at whatever level and in any setting knows that developing engagement with humanities content requires more than just "talking at" the learners in your charge. How can we create those same opportunities for exploration and engagement when many online platforms literally reduce one to a talking head? For organizations delivering summer institutes to support the professional growth of educators in both K-12 and college settings this question was especially pertinent as modeling engaging use of object collections, oral histories, archival materials, and historic spaces is core.    During this session, the presenters - all of whom flipped their NEH-supported summer institutes and seminars to be offered remotely on very short notice - share their choices around course design and digital tools used, the successes (or not) experienced and lessons learned. This session would be of particular interest to those working in historic spaces, archives, and formal education settings with teaching responsibilities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents the general use of deep learning for texturing within the virtual unwrapping model. Virtual unwrapping is a software pipeline for the noninvasive recovery of texts inside damaged manuscripts or scrolls via the analysis of tomography and consists of three stages. Segmentation isolates pages or layers as surface meshes, texturing paints these surfaces based on the local neighborhood in the tomography, and flattening produces legible images from the folded, rolled or warped meshes. The pipeline allows for the recovery and restoration of a variety of otherwise lost or hidden heritage objects. This work further expands the generalization of the texturing stage from that of Parker et al. (2019) which trains a neural network to act as the texturing component. Neural networks can be trained to detect not only carbon inks, but any desired signal in tomography data. Additionally, they can output not only color images, but any modality or form desired by the scholar. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) A conceptualization of texture mapping as a general function, perhaps learned, mapping tomography to any modality is established. 2) Several technical improvements to the previous neural network approach are discussed. 3) This framework is applied to new manuscript scan data, yielding state-of-the-art results.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Arizona Sicily Project (2018-ongoing) is an intensive pedestrian survey of the coastal zone between the Sicilian cities of Marsala and Mazara del Vallo. While this diachronic project seeks to chart the ties between North Africa and western Sicily in all periods, this paper focuses on the evidence dating to the Punic and early Roman periods, when the zone was under Carthaginian control and immediately after. This survey is the first to document systematically the Punic period in this countryside, and thus contributes to prior work at Motya and Marsala (Lilybaeum) in the Punic period. We present our methodology, data, and preliminary analysis of Punic materials and sites found in the survey zone. Drawing on this new data and the results of an earlier survey north of Marsala, this paper considers the local impact of Carthage, given its proximity across the Sicilian Channel. We interrogate the degree to which Carthage itself was transformative to rural residents in our zone, compared to its colonies on the Sicilian coast. In other words, beyond a general identification of this as a ‘Punic' countryside, did Carthaginian influence significantly affect settlement in the territory, to a greater extent than the influence of the Punic cities present on Sicily itself?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, I suggest a new ethnomusicological method for advancing the vitality of the arts: Digital Humanities. Song in the Sumatran Highlands, the digital project that I am in the process of building, draws on more than twenty years of ethnographic research to celebrate the Minangkabau vocal genre known as saluang for the flute that accompanies the vocalists. Using the platform Scalar, the interactive, user-friendly site is designed to be rich in multimedia (images, audios, and video), multimodal (multiple ways of experiencing and navigating the material), collaborative and responsive to interests of the saluang community. It does so by documenting the repertoire—the songs number in the hundreds—and mapping the sonic manifestations of place through tagging song titles, landmarks referenced in song texts, performers, and performances with geospatial metadata. I argue that this project helps reimagine the ways ethnomusicologists share research by moving beyond texts and closer to local sonic, visual, and spatial epistemologies and the sensorial worlds of performance. Key to the design of the project is representing ethnomusicological knowledge in formats more accessible to the public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Encyclopedic texts and reference works played a central role in managing and circulating textual information in the wake of the sixteenth-century publishing boom in China. Innovations in finding devices within such genres have often been associated with the rise of "consultation reading," which allowed a reader to access the material contained within efficiently and without having to wade through excessive textual material. This paper will suggest that "consultation reading" was only one of multiple strategies employed by late imperial Chinese readers in their use of encyclopedic texts. I focus here on Fang Yizhi's (1611–1671) Comprehensive Elegances (Tongya), a major encyclopedic text of the seventeenth century. The organizational structure of the text would have allowed for consultation of specific entries, but instructions for use in the paratextual material and embedded within the entries themselves indicate that the text may also have been designed to be read sequentially, almost as one would read a novel or treatise. This sequential mode of reading is evident in the instructions for use in numerous other contemporary "reference works," such as dictionaries. By highlighting the multiple methods of reading proposed in late imperial encyclopedic compilations, I highlight the literary appeal of encyclopedic information for contemporary readers and reconsider the role of such texts in the period's literary and intellectual life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Late imperial China witnessed an explosion of textual production, from manuscripts to woodblock and movable type prints. Increased availability of books posed new challenges to compilers and readers who sought comprehensiveness in a sea of information. One of the primary arenas for managing and circulating information was the production of a variety of encyclopedic genres and reference works. Innovations in finding devices within such genres have often been associated with the rise of "consultation reading." But was piecemeal consultation the only way to use encyclopedic reference works? Or could an encyclopedia be read cover to cover like a novel? This talk considers the reading strategies suggested in Fang Yizhi's ???(1611–1671) Tongya (?? Comprehensive Elegances), a major encyclopedic text of the seventeenth century. Despite the potential of this text to be consulted for specific information, its entries may also have been designed to be read sequentially. Numerous other contemporary "reference works," such as dictionaries, invited sequential reading, as well. By highlighting the multiple modes of reading proposed in late imperial encyclopedic compilations, I reposition the place of such texts in the period's literary and intellectual life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The pioneering and cosmopolitan Chinese-American screen, stage and television performer Anna May Wong paid her one and only China visit in 1936, in the aftermath of her race-based exclusion from MGM's mega-production The Good Earth, and on the brink of the Second Sino-Japanese War. This trip was filmed by the photojournalist "Newsreel" Wong and by Wong herself. Two decades later, at the height of the Red Scare, Wong's quasi-travelogue footage was reedited into an ABC television episode, "Native Land" (of the Bold Journey series), which was narrated by the aging Wong and broadcast in April 1957 to the McCarthy-era American audience.  The travelogue footage doubling as a time capsule crystalized the meeting, clashing and negotiation of different times, geopolitics and differently situated audiences, all of which were centered on layers of mediation—of the young cosmopolitan Wong mediating herself to her Chinese public (including nationalist detractors who deemed her Hollywood films defaming to China) on footage originally intended to be shown to the mid-1930s American movie audience, and of the aging Wong mediating her younger self's experience in the bygone pre-WWII China to the 1950s American television audience.  My paper unpacks these layers of mediation to probe Wong's agency that was fashioned through concatenated media making (from film to television) in articulation with her negotiation with different modes of nationalism in the semi-colonial China and in the Cold War America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Anna May Wong, the most well-known Chinese-American performer active in the first half of the 20th-c., has been commonly seen as the screen-stage originator of Orientalist feminine stereotypes of Lotus Blossom and Dragon Lady—both ending up dead, hence her sarcastic summary of her fictional persona as the woman who had died a thousand times.   This preponderant victim discourse, however, has obliterated an intriguing strand in her performance career—as a comedienne in some 1920s shorts produced by Hal Roach. This paper unearths Wong's performance endeavors as a comedienne by piecing together and contextualizing archival materials ranging from her Hal Roach contracts to fanzine publicities. My goal is two-pronged—enhancing our understanding of Wong's oeuvre and performance legacy, and probing the ways in which early comedy shorts intertwined with the race-gender discourses especially as they pertained to the so-called inscrutable "Oriental" face and femininity. I argue that Wong's comedies, while not as abundant as her pathos-laden dramatic films, offers a crucial site for exploring a dimension of her performative agency—one that has escaped critical attention and yet powerfully challenges the received understanding of Asian American racial melancholia.   Methodologically, I ponder questions of how we recover obscured film histories, what to recover, and how to interpret or contextualize such histories so as to illuminate marginalized spaces and lacunae. Grappling with these questions necessitates engagement with the scarcity and incompleteness of empirical evidence. Thus, studying Wong's sparsely documented comedic performance as part of the supporting cast for Hal Roach's 1920s shorts holds broader ramifications for finetuning our methodology of doing early film historiography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Medieval people didn't hesitate to go to court to defend their honor; they took every opportunity to protect themselves from slander and insults. Historians, building on the work of anthropologists of the Mediterranean, have long been attentive to the gendered difference in how medieval people both insulted each other and defended themselves in court. Women were much more likely to suffer slurs based on their perceived lack of sexual honor- they were called "sluts," or "whores" and defended themselves vigorously against those attacks in courts. But what happened when the women defending themselves against the charge of being a whore were in fact municipal prostitutes?     Drawing on the one extant set of criminal court records from the fourteenth century and additional records of fines paid for those guilty of slander and insult, this paper will ask why prostitutes brought the business of the brothel into the purview of the criminal court. What advantages accrued to women considered without sexual honor when they swore to tell the truth in a court of law? What manipulations occurred to restrain bodies marked by assumptions of their unrestrained sexuality within the system of the law?  How did the identity of prostitute conflict with that of witness? What motivated the women to contain the violence of the brothel within a legal system that categorized them as outside of the bounds of legal protection? This paper considers how the category of "public woman" intersected and overlapped with that of litigant and witness in a court of law.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Entity recognition provides semantic access to ancient materials in the Digital Humanities: it exposes people and places of interest in texts that cannot be read exhaustively, facilitates linking resources and can provide a window into text contents, even for texts with no translations. In this paper we present entity recognition for Coptic, the language of Hellenistic era Egypt. We evaluate NLP approaches to the task and lay out difficulties in applying them to a low-resource, morphologically complex language. We present solutions for named and non-named nested entity recognition and semi-automatic entity linking to Wikipedia, relying on robust dependency parsing, feature-based CRF models, and hand-crafted knowledge base resources, enabling high accuracy NER with orders of magnitude less data than those used for high resource languages. The results suggest avenues for research on other languages in similar settings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeologists (including the author) investigating seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Native sites in the Chesapeake point out how materially different these assemblages are from those recovered from contemporary colonial sites. Characterized by materials almost wholly produced by Native hands with some objects of European manufacture, they are indeed different and have been used to argue that Native people in a colonized land resisted colonial control in part through the maintenance of Native practices. These assemblages, however, are rarely examined vis-à-vis assemblages from earlier Native sites or from contemporary Native sites, resulting in a not-so-subtle reinforcement of the deep history/colonial divide along with the assumption that the template (the "norm") for this period is the European colonial site.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper outlines an approach to community based co-design of interactive narrative (IN) cultural heritage experiences, based on the author's development of an advanced-level project course on the topic over the past six years. Several projects are discussed as case studies, including projects that address the history of Irish immigrants working as domestic laborers in Troy NY in the 1850s; urban renewal in Albany NY and Troy NY in the 1960s and 1970s; the Native American nations' Iroquois Confederacy in present-day Cohoes NY; and the upstate New York history of Harriet Tubman, the legendary African American liberator of hundreds of enslaved people during the 1850s and 1860s. Issues highlighted include the ethics of telling other people's stories in the IN medium, the myth of the designer as impartial facilitator, the power structures of different types of design processes, and complexities of large scale projects that incorporate emergent technology, contested histories, and a wide range of stakeholders and participants. Lessons learned are shared in the form of a set of guidelines to help shape design and development of interactive narrative projects in educational, museum, and heritage settings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will discuss convergence and dissonance across a range of sources for Bamana-speaking Kaarta, a non-Muslim led polity in the West African Sahel that sat at the intersection between networks of trans-Saharan and Atlantic trading networks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In response to a generalized lack of attention to Africa in narratives of early modern history, Africanists have emphasized the parallel and interconnected nature of processes unfolding in continental Africa with those elsewhere, while at the same time pointing out distinctive qualities that modify or qualify larger Atlantic or global trends.  Though indispensable for historians, African oral and European written sources for the West African Sahel were created for distinct purposes, organized around divergent premises and centered different audiences. Limits imposed by available sources and certain conceptual frameworks have continued to pose significant challenges— especially for incorporating the historical experiences of non-elites, and of relations across gender, ethnicity and other forms of socially constructed difference. How should historians of western Africa approach these sources to illuminate the complexity and contingency of earlier contexts for a polity heavily reliant on mercenary warfare in the larger economy of slaving while also asserting itself within a religiously and culturally heterogeneous region? This paper will argue that comparative close readings, and contextualization of traditional oral narratives, archival documents and material sources can produce historical insight submerged within these sources about the beliefs, attitudes and assumptions about the people of Kaarta and their dynamic interactions with a wider world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Code-switching has long interested linguists, with computational work in particular focusing on speech and social media data (Sitaram et al., 2019). This paper contrasts these informal instances of code-switching to its appearance in more formal registers, by examining the mixture of languages in the Deutsches Textarchiv (DTA), a corpus of 1406 primarily German books from the 17th to 19th centuries. We automatically annotate and manually inspect spans of six embedded languages (Latin, French, English, Italian, Spanish, and Greek) in the corpus. We quantitatively analyze the differences between code-switching patterns in these books and those in more typically studied speech and social media corpora. Furthermore, we address the practical task of predicting code-switching from features of the matrix language alone in the DTA corpus. Such classifiers can help reduce errors when optical character recognition or speech transcription is applied to a large corpus with rare embedded languages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We explore the task of quotability identification, in which, given a document, we aim to identify which of its passages are the most quotable, i.e. the most likely to be directly quoted by later derived documents. We approach quotability identification as a passage ranking problem and evaluate how well both feature-based and BERT-based (Devlin et al., 2019) models rank the passages in a given document by their predicted quotability. We explore this problem through evaluations on five datasets that span multiple languages (English, Latin) and genres of literature (e.g. poetry, plays, novels) and whose corresponding derived documents are of multiple types (news, journal articles). Our experiments confirm the relatively strong performance of BERT-based models on this task, with the best model, a RoBERTA sequential sentence tagger, achieving an average ? of 0.35 and NDCG@1, 5, 50 of 0.26, 0.31 and 0.40, respectively, across all five datasets.</Abstract>

The project utilized the resources of PhillyHistory.org, a collaborative online database of historic photographs and maps from five Philadelphia area institutions. This paper will examine the state of mobile augmented reality technology and its current and possible applications for use within cultural institutions. Through an exploration and evaluation of the successes and challenges of the Department of Records' augmented reality project, we will investigate how this technology can be applied to other archives and museums.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Leonardo's Botanical Anatomies: Nature's Perfection and the Cycle of Life&amp;#x0D; This paper addresses Leonardo's graphic approach to the physiognomy of botanical liveliness and natural regeneration, especially around the time of his studies for The Battle of the Anghiari and Leda and the Swan, ca. 1500–10. Using Leonardo's Study of Brambles (RL12419) as a point of departure, this paper explores how Leonardo's botanical "parts" ("elementi") reflect rhetorical concerns related to natural fecundity, its processes and threats. Through close, formal readings of idealizing natural "limbs" and their graphic antitheses, this paper suggests how Leonardo's botanical and related studies reflect broader concerns with natural history and functions, even as they reveal the complexity of his empirical, rhetorical, artistic, and theoretical preoccupations. Ultimately, Leonardo constructed "telling," rhetorically motivated botanical anatomies that slyly appear as if they are drawn from nature itself. For the draftsman, these graphic microcosms arguably acted as graphic proofs of both the perfection and inevitable mutability of nature writ large.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>&amp;#x0D; Around 1480 Leonardo da Vinci wrote of what may have been a seminal event in his young life — an encounter in a cave with the fossilized skeleton of a great "fish." I will propose that Leonardo entered one of the many caves that punctuate the Tuscan landscape, and there saw something marvelous that would influence his art and his investigations of nature. Within a few years of this entry in Codex Arundel Leonardo drew and painted a number of images in which a grotto or sedimentary rock formations, home to a host of fossils, played a pronounced role. In the decades to follow Leonardo wrote frequently about the history of the earth, describing in detail the sedimentation processes that built up the layers of rock and led to deposits of fossils. My paper will link these visual and written works to paleontological studies of areas explored by Leonardo.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>&amp;#x0D; In his notebooks, Leonardo da Vinci argues for the superiority of painting over poetry by praising the painter's ability to represent human figures as "united bodies" while the poet can represent them only as "dismembered bodies." "The poet" he continues, "in describing . . . any figure can only show it to you consecutively, bit by bit, while the painter will display it all at once." Yet in hundreds of sketches and anatomical drawings Leonardo focuses on dismembered bodies — faces, skulls, eyes, shoulders, arms, legs, feet, hearts — beautifully drawn and exactly detailed. Why do these images of dismembered body parts so outnumber images of the "united bodies" that Leonardo preferred? This presentation will suggest answers for both his artistic and anatomical studies and then argue that Leonardo's few whole-body anatomical drawings have special value as representations of the emerging ideas and values of Renaissance humanism in his thought and work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Leonardo da Vinci famously looked to the body as a site for ideals and sports of nature, musica humana, creative invention, and for expression of — among many other things — spiritual devotion. In at least three of his Windsor anatomical studies, Leonardo da Vinci explored the mechanics and anatomy of kneeling. In particular, some of the drawings and related text explore the way physical structures allow for particular types of movement. This paper seeks to place Leonardo's anatomical studies of kneeling within the context of his own paintings, and of patronage and religious practice. That many of his early works may have been associated with ecclesiastical or monastic patrons and include kneeling figures suggest that an awareness of monastic beliefs about kneeling as a prayer gesture may have played a role in content and viewer response.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>&amp;#x0D; Albeit neglected, Leonardo da Vinci's graphic interrogation of the body subtly implicates music and its quadrivial prism reveals a semiotics of musical embodiment. Leonardo's somatic exploration of form, symmetries, and biomechanics refers music in disegni ranging from the embryo drawings to the Vitruvian man. This paper probes these musico-theoretical resonances considering Leonardo's annotations on music, some glossing the same folios bearing these images of the body. While Leonardo eschews metaphysical speculation in favor of a more empirical epistemology, such concordance suggests Leonardo's self-positioning within the schematic orthodoxies of musica humana. If music is a weaker sister to art, her embodiment of the cosmos and inspiration of corporeal motion frames Leonardo's project of body neatly within this Neoplatonist lens. Leonardo envisioned music as a negotiation between acoustics, philosophy, and the materiality of tangible performance practice. This study articulates this vision as embedded in Leonardo's sketches of the body.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines Leonardo's drawings that depict how one might travel under and through water. He drew figures fitted with masks to breath under water and others fitted with floatation devices to walk across its surface. These proto-scuba divers and walkers on water offer the promise — or at least the potential — for gaining a new kind of access to water's depths. These drawings reveal Leonardo's serious inquiry into their invention. Not merely whimsical inventions, the devices invite comparison with Leonardo's deepest concerns about the observable world. These mechanisms open up ways for thinking about Leonardo's preoccupation with a phenomenological investigation of the water environment — after all, what is scuba gear but a means for experiencing fully one's senses under water? — and by extension, its picturing. These drawings pinpoint where technological challenges abut the difficulty of accounting for and depicting water's ever-changing form.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>&amp;#x0D; Leonardo's grotesque heads are rightly celebrated for their novelty and variety. This paper examines both the theoretical precepts concerning the grotesque written by the author and others, as well as the visual tradition of which they formed an innovative part. In particular, this research explores how Aristotelian thought allows for both an ideal beauty and an ideal ugliness. Leonardo's drawings from Uffizi #446E to the later Chatsworth examples present a visual compendium of idealized, even hyperbolic, ugliness. The effect of such images, either singularly or collectively, is to subvert his audience's basic assumptions about portraiture. The subversion extends even to Alberti's more general notion of the commemorative purpose of painting. By refining and perfecting ugliness through purposeful distortion of certain facial features, Leonardo shaped the discernment of the grotesque as a creative marvel.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>&amp;#x0D; This paper discusses Leonardo's writings from the early Florentine period (1478– 80), in particular the texts contained in Codex Arundel fol. 155r–156v. These early literary experiments reveal a Baroque ante litteram through a variety of affinities: the use of elaborate metaphors, the preoccupation with metamorphosis in nature, the concept of wonder or meraviglia, the grotesque, the infinite, the interest in water, dynamism, theatricality, and antithesis. In his youthful experimentation with complex metaphors, Leonardo anticipates by almost two-hundred years what Emanuele Tesauro would lay out under the heading "Conceits of Nature" in his seventeenth-century manual on metaphors called The Aristotelian Telescope (Il Cannocchiale Aristotelico). The analysis of these early writings will be combined with a consideration of pictorial experimentation in Leonardo's Uffizi Drawing #446E and the Adoration of the Magi from approximately the same period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Like Petrarch before him, Leonardo drew specific geographical features as well as more politically charged city plans to understand his surroundings. His practice began with locating himself on the maps he drew as a foundation for his theoretical studies. Area maps and several technical constructions of cities reveal his interest in creating accurate records, whereas topographical studies demonstrate where nature and experience converge. Leonardo proceeded from landscape, orography, chorography, and city plans, later advancing to drawings that incorporated ideas about politics and power. His agency was in the employment of natural science in the mapping of power. Maps were metaphors of power. They served his patrons well in determining how to literally gain ground; for Leonardo they provided the linkage between knowing and being. Hundreds of sketches for buildings, earthworks, temporary structures, and the management of land, water, and space began with locating his place in the landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper discusses Leonardo's knowledge of ancient and medieval optical writings in the early Florentine years. The detailed analysis of the artist's early paintings and drawings is combined with an examination of the practical uses of optics, the artist's early optical notes, and a consideration of the optical writings that were available in the vernacular in late fifteenth century Florence. From this inferential investigation, the young Leonardo emerges as an attentive reader of Arab optics, especially Alhazen's De aspectibus, and as a well-versed artist in practical and theoretical optics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Due to decades of neglect and obscurity, Cahokia collections at the University of Illinois dating back to the 1920s made by Warren K. Moorehead and others have gone largely unknown. They include a collection from the Powell Mound destruction in 1930-31 by A.R. Kelly, and 450 boxes from CRM projects between 1959 and 1991, by Charles J. Bareis. Collections are from most areas at the Cahokia site. With funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the catalog and some photographs are on-line. Descriptions of each excavation project, and descriptions of archived documents are available in Adobe Acrobat files.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Two presenters from Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) gave an overview of OSF's digitization project at the American Society for Theatre Research/Theatre Library Association combined meeting. A summary follows.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; From 1996-1999, longtime OSF company member, Carl Ritchie (nearly 50 years as an actor, director, playwright and OSF's first year-round publicity director in the 1950s and 1960s), conducted a detailed inventory of OSF's audio collection—nearly 2,000 reel-to-reel and cassette tapes documenting productions back to 1950. Ritchie listened to each recording, identified its contents and created an innovative categorization scheme resulting in a six volume, 900+ page catalog. As a result, the OSF Archives had a well-organized audio collection offering a connection to OSF's past that otherwise would have been lost. However, following the project's completion, the tapes were restricted due to fragility and remained inaccessible for more than a decade.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; When the OSF Archives began preparing materials for a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Preservation and Access grant in 2012, Ritchie's work formed the foundation of the proposal. His catalog served as a guide, and his urgent calls for action to save many deteriorating tapes remain an ongoing inspiration. The NEH grant is funding the digitization of 2,655 audiovisual items, most from Ritchie's catalog. The majority of these materials will be available to the research community online in 2016 and stand as a testament to one man's dedication and foresight.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using Dewey's pattern of inquiry as a template, I challenge two widely held interpretations of "Personal Reactions During the War," a chapter in Jane Addams's 1922 book, Peace and Bread in Time of War. First, although the chapter is generally read as an autobiographical account of the psychic costs Addams suffered during World War One, I show how it gives a theoretically sophisticated exploration of how war blocked inquiry for an international group of peace advocates on both sides of the war. Second, the chapter's concluding sentence, where Addams declares her "categorical belief that a man's primary allegiance is to his vision of the truth," is generally read in a straightforward way. I show how Addams intended it to be read ironically, as demonstrating how the war had made a travesty of her deepest commitments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the recent fieldwork season at Tell Edfu several hundred new seal-impressions have been discovered in connection with a late Middle Kingdom administrative structure. They were found in a secure archaeological context which is the abandonment layer covering the floor of a columned hall that is part of larger building complex closely linked to the mayor of the town.  The pottery from this layer dates to the 13th Dynasty including imported vessels, which have been identified as Levantine Painted Ware, also common for the late Middle Kingdom. &amp;#x0D; Many of the seal-impressions found in this context show the typical late 13th Dynasty motives but a large portion of them display the characteristics of the Tell el-Dab'a workshop and the Canaanite scarabs of the Second Intermediate Period. The most unexpected find among this group were several seal-impressions showing the cartouche of the Hyksos ruler Khayan, who has been dated to the beginning of the 15th Dynasty.  This is the first time that concrete evidence for a Hyksos king south of Gebelein has been found. This unique discovery opens many new questions about the nature of contact between the Hyksos and Upper Egypt prior to the armed conflict with the Theban kings of the 17th Dynasty. It also requires a serious reconsideration of the chronology of the Second Intermediate Period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The ability to write software (to script, to program, to code) is a vital skill for students and their future data-centric, multidisciplinary careers. We present a ten-year effort to teach introductory programming skills in domain-focused courses to students across divisions in our liberal arts college. By creatively working with colleagues in Biology, Statistics, and now English, we have designed, modified, and offered six iterations of two courses: "DNA" and "Computing for Poets". Larger percentages of women have consistently enrolled in these two courses vs. the traditional first course in the major. We share our open source course materials and present here our use of a blended learning classroom that leverages the increasing quality of online video lectures and programming practice sites in an attempt to maximize faculty-student interactions in class.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session will discuss HT+BW, a project to integrate the HTDL corpus, processed at the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC), with the Bookworm platform for text analysis, developed at the Cultural Observatory. Bookworm greatly extends the type of analysis that was popularized by the Google Ngrams Viewer, making it possible to "slice and dice" the data in an arbitrary corpus, in real time, using a greatly enhanced set of content-based and metadata-based features. The HT+BW will greatly increase the value of the HTRC because it will assist humanities scholars and students in their effort to delve deeper into the HathiTrust corpus and to explore more complex, multi-faceted research questions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We describe Mink, a new web browser extension that pro- vides a different model for integration of the live and archived web. While a user browses the live web, Mink actively queries the archives and reports other instances of the page in the archives without requiring active querying by the user. Further, by querying the archives dynamically and asyn- chronously, a user can view the extent to which the currently viewed page on the live web has been archived and proactively submit a request to various archives using an overlay on the live web page and a simple interface.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this tsunami of global crises, which includes exploding global population, climate change, peak oil, public health, and adequate housing for burgeoning single households, planning is more important then ever to ensure a sustainable livelihood for future generations.  These seemingly independent crises have all reached their tipping point in the beginning of the 21st century and many countries are looking at high-capital technological solutions to resolve these crises.  These technocratic responses will be unable to solve the problems in their entirety.  &amp;#x0D; Physical planning merged with geographic, political, social and economic strategies are necessary to combat the challenges that lie ahead.  Energy required to move from building to building is far greater than the energy requirements to cool and heat individual buildings.  The solution lies in the creations of walkable neighborhoods and the densification of existing settlements.  To this end the development of objective criteria to evaluate which settlements should be retrofitted is essential.&amp;#x0D; The planning profession needs to be at the forefront of cost-effective solutions that yield value, provide safety, create community, and offer the populace an alternate lifestyle that is more desirable than the current market place dream of privacy, exclusivity, and segregation.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>3.More energy is utilized moving between buildings, than used for heating and cooling buildings.  The architecture profession has concentrated on improving the building envelope and reducing energy consumption within individual buildings.  This approach will only solve half the problem.  The principles and techniques of urban design embody solutions to partially solve crises such as the exploding global population, climate change, peak oil, public health, and adequate housing for burgeoning single households.  This session will explore urban design solutions that are needed to supplement high-capital technological solutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Georgia State University Library holds a historically significant collection of Atlanta area city planning maps, publications, and demographic data. Dated from the 1930s to the early 2000s, this print collection is a largely unique set of 1500 maps and 250 publications, which depict and describe the built environment and demographic make-up of metropolitan Atlanta. Within this collection is a printed data series, "Population and Housing," which contains yearly demographic estimates from the regional level down to the census tract level for each year from 1955 to 2003. Access to this planning material has been hindered due to a lack of cataloging, the oversized format of the maps, and by the print-only format of the demographic data. To increase access and to enhance the usefulness of this material, the library has digitized these items, geo-referenced each map, and has extracted and converted the demographic data into a digital dataset and provides free access to this material from the Planning Atlanta site. This presentation will discuss how transforming this once prohibitively difficult to access material into useful formats, such as Excel and GeoTiff files, has greatly increased its accessibility, leading to successful integration of this material into teaching and research projects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Throughout Addams's lifetime, the theme that social healing comes through the extension of sympathy remained at the center of her ethics. She derived her conception of sympathy from the science of the day. Like many intellectuals of the era, she regarded sympathy as a primitive instinct and a primary factor in human social evolution. Unlike those who segmented the civilized from the primitive and denigrated the latter, Addams used sympathy to bridge these divisions. She created variations by adapting the theme to the contingencies of rapid industrialization and a brutal world war.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An important component of the "Engaging the Piedmont: Transitions in Virginia Slavery 1730-1790" project is public outreach. The project website seeks to inform both a professional and wider audience through papers, images, blogs and specific content aimed at K-12 and teachers.&amp;#x0D; The first educational piece is an interactive module, aimed at grades 10-12. It allows students to look at land patterns through an exhaustive study of patents. Students will engage with maps, and related primary documents, showing changing land ownership from 1710 through 1770. They will be asked to consider how rivers and roads affected development, and to consider the effect of land fragmentation and family ownership on the building of community, for both the land owners and their enslaved workers.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Interest in the landscapes of slavery has grown over the past 20 years. Archaeologists have combined evidence from macro- and micro-scale approaches to landscape that includes analyses of the social, economic, and environmental factors governing planters' decisions about the siting of quarters as well as the use of space by enslaved residents. Central to this research are the questions of how enslaved people structured non-architectural spaces, what activities they undertook within them, and how domestic landscapes served them as community spaces, centers of economic production, and places of resistance.  At Poplar Forest, archaeologists have been exploring the landscapes of slave quarters dating from the American Revolution to the late antebellum period. In this paper, I use features, individual artifacts, artifact distributions, and soil chemistry to examine the structure and use of the domestic landscape of the Wingos quarter, a late-eighteenth century site on the periphery of the Poplar Forest plantation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper discusses methodologies for tracing the development of domestic and work spaces associated with enslaved people at Poplar Forest and Indian Camp, two plantations located in the Virginia piedmont. The rediscovery of these ephemeral landscapes has been accomplished through a multilayered approach to diverse types of evidence including soil chemistry, artifact distributions, ethnobotanical remains, features, remote sensing and the documentary record. Together, these sources reveal aspects of the layout and function of spaces on plantation peripheries, such as the Wingos Quarter at Poplar Forest, and help to document landscapes that many scholars do not  commonly associate with plantations, such as the tavern-store-plantation complex that developed at Indian Camp in the early 19th-century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Indian Camp, a plantation in the eastern Virginia piedmont, served as an outlying quarter farm for tobacco cultivation from 1730 to the 1790s. Just prior to 1800, an ordinary and retail store were built there and continued in operation into the 1840s. Since 2011, archaeologists working on the property, now known as French's Tavern, have concentrated efforts in a field west of the surviving historic structures. The site contains a complex array of post holes, pits, piers and other features, evidence of a dynamic landscape that took shape in the final quarter of the eighteenth century and was reconfigured throughout the antebellum period. This paper reviews the archaeological evidence uncovered to date and considers the roles of ordinaries and stores as important places of exchange for both free and enslaved piedmont residents, allowing rural people to cross plantation boundaries and participate, to some extent, in wider social and economic networks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Indian Camp was a 1200-acre plantation in the eastern piedmont of Virginia. Owned by the Eppes, Wayles and Jefferson families from the 1730s to the 1770s, the land was subdivided by the late 18th century. Archaeologists from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, have surveyed portions of the property looking for slave quarters. This paper will summarize findings to date, including the discoveries of two structures and an assemblage of artifacts dating from the third quarter of the 18th through the mid-19th centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper combines archaeological data from three slave quarters at Poplar Forest, a piedmont Virginia plantation owned by Thomas Jefferson from 1774-1826, with historical data on the demographic structure of the enslaved community who lived there, to test recent models that attribute changes in house size and subfloor pit frequencies in Chesapeake quarters over time to family development or to the transition from tobacco- to wheat-based systems of agricultural production.</Abstract>

Wingo's is part of Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Forest in Bedford County, Virginia. The site was occupied 1773-1790s as a residence of enslaved African Americans and their overseer. Structural features at Wingo's are limited to two sub-floor pits, likely representing one slave structure. This lack of structural evidence leaves questions about site composition, organization, and activities unanswered. Plowzone artifact and soil chemical distributions serve as a principal means for reconstructing the 18th-century landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While archaeologists are increasingly studying sites associated with enslavement in the Virginia piedmont, the preponderance of work has been carried out at Tidewater sites. Historical evidence suggests significant differences in demography, in the timing of agricultural transitions from tobacco to grain-based economies, and in access to consumer goods between the two regions which have not been critically evaluated. This paper focuses on two late eighteenth-century piedmont sites from the Poplar Forest plantation, to explore internal variability and to begin to examine how regional differences might be visible archaeologically.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeologists have struggled to define slave quartering sites, basing their interpretations on the material evidence of houses, landscapes and more portable objects. Since the 1960s, researchers have considered "Africanisms," assemblage patterning and predictive geographic models to answer the question: what defines a slave quarter archaeologically? The accumulation of an archaeological dataset of over 100 quartering sites in Virginia over the past 40 years has demonstrated that these sites are highly variable across time and space and has underscored the problematic nature of site definition. This paper examines three Virginia quartering sites dating to the Revolutionary War period. The observed similarities and differences between them likely resulted from a combination of historical circumstances, shared processes of racialization, poverty and regional variation in the institution of slavery. What tools might we use to help tease these factors apart and examine their effects more closely?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While neighborhoods are dynamic entities, their past interactions may be partially reconstructed through documentary analysis.  Historical research relating to the Indian Camp property in modern Powhatan County, Virginia has enabled archaeologists to track social and economic relationships in the area from 1730 to 1825. Plotting these relationships spatially in ArcGIS 10 has clarified historic dynamics of power and inequality through land and slave ownership and kinship networks. By examining a landscape over a 100-year span using ArcGIS, names and people become part of a dynamic social and economic network, spaces become places, and a diachronic history of a neighborhood emerges.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will focus on botanical remains from the Wingo's site, a quarter most likely occupied in the late 18th century when Jefferson was managing his Poplar Forest properties from afar. Using macrobotanical remains can allow archaeologists to understand the diverse nature of enslaved foodways as well as the slaves' impact on and interaction with the environment around them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) provides research support for the growing corpus of over fourteen million volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) through a suite of tools text analysis. The size of the HTDL affords scholars the opportunity to increase the scale of their inquiry and to ask new kinds of research questions. The HTRC tools create avenues for scholars to pursue these new modes of research by allowing for "non-consumptive" text analysis with the HTDL corpus. Through demonstrations, hands-on exercises, and discussion, workshop attendees will learn about the suite of HTRC tools and how they can be used to support research and teaching.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Attendees will come away with an understanding of:&amp;#x0D; HTRC tools that allow researchers to build custom subcollections of items from the HTDL, run HTRC-provided, off-the-shelf algorithms against them, and interpret the results;&amp;#x0D; HathiTrust+Bookworm, an interactive visualization for studying lexical trends within material from the HTDL; and&amp;#x0D; the Extracted Features (EF) Dataset, which provides page-level metadata and data derived from the items in a subcollection that a researcher can download and analyze on his or her own computer.&amp;#x0D; The workshop will present scenarios and example use cases in which HTRC tools shine, and will demonstrate the ways in which they can complement each other. Attendees will learn new strategies and approaches for the complex research questions that digitized text corpora are uniquely poised to help answer across academic disciplines.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The storied Potomac and the relatively under-studied Rappahannock river valleys were both important sites in the longue durée of American history. How, then, does a growing body of evidence deriving from new and old fieldwork and private collections serve to shape and reshape the stories told about these important places? How do digital technologies move the ball forward? Perhaps most importantly, what happens when a new generation brings their skills and creativity to the study of these two important river valleys? This paper provides the context for the papers in this session, including a brief history of archaeology in the two river valleys and the methods and theories shaping that earlier work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Hastings Site, a c. 1690-1710 English colonial site located in King George County, Virginia. was tested in the summers of 2018 and 2019 by archaeologists from St. Mary's College of Maryland. A combination of shovel testing, test unit excavation, and remote sensing surveys were used to investigate the site. The artifacts and features recovered from the site include Native American and Colonial ceramics, tobacco pipes, and a series of circular anomalies, one of which was revealed to be a barrel ring. The combination of both Native and early colonial artifacts in the recovered assemblage suggest some level of interaction with Native communities just downriver. The archaeological investigations sought to clarify who was living at the site.  This paper presents the preliminary findings from this research and provides insight into how the site fits into the history of the Rappahannock River Valley during this period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Colonoware is a hand-built, unglazed, low-fired ceramic produced in European forms usually by Native Americans or Africans/African Americans. Colonoware fragments from Maryland and Virginia were examined to determine temper, surface treatment, and form. Chemical analysis using x-ray fluorescence was further performed on samples from seven sites in the Rappahannock River Valley. The sites included in the study represent each of the groups that have been associated with colonoware. including Native American, enslaved African American, and colonial households. This paper reports the results of this study including the distributions of colonoware attributes in an effort to link these distributions to various learning communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The study of lithic artifacts is essential for understanding Native American lifeways throughout history, including mobility and migration, trade and exchange, site function, and settlement practices. This paper presents an analysis of lithic artifacts from the Rappahannock River Valley in Virginia. Using lithic data collected from over 30 sites dating from 7000 BC to 200 AD, information on mobility, migration, and trade between groups along the Rappahannock is revealed. This paper discusses how Native Americans along the Rappahannock moved west to east during the Archaic period. Additionally, the paper discusses how Native Americans procured their raw materials and how that changed through time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Rappahannock is the least archaeologically studied of the major river valleys in the Chesapeake region; a concern recently addressed through the NEH funded research project, Indigenous Borderlands of the Chesapeake: The Lower Rappahannock Valley Landscape: 200-1850 CE. In this paper, I will examine local, regional, and trans-Atlantic trade networks within the Rappahannock River Valley through the analysis of locally-made and imported clay tobacco pipes recently excavated. Additionally, these pipe assemblages from the Rappahannock sites will be compared to networks revealed through previous studies of the James and Potomac River Valleys. Both historic Native Virginia and Maryland and English Colonial sites will be considered in this analysis to understand differential trade access and consumer choice in the 17th century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Early colonial accounts of the Rappahannock River and its people detail events in which the landscape was efficiently utilized to respond to perceived threats from English invaders. Captain John Smith recounts two events in which the Rappahannock used the landscape to mount two assaults and maintain a strategic advantage. This paper explores the potential methods in which the people of the Rappahannock effectively made use of the landscape to communicate and protect their communities. The role of settlement placement and location of monuments are also discussed for their roles in everyday communication throughout the river valley.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I hope to speak to you on the importance of traditional stories and oral histories. These stories have laid the foundation for documentary and archaeological research by Dr. Ed Ragan and now St. Mary's College, with all three merging together and validating the importance of oral histories. Early on in my work in the Tribe, however, we would tell scholars our stories, but they often dismissed them. After many years of experiencing this rejection of what we knew to be true, we stopped telling our stories to outsiders. But keeping this information closed to the outside world and not speaking about it also caused harm, as we began to question what we had been taught from the elders. Yet every story I have relayed from my elders to Dr. Ed Ragan and St. Mary's has been validated. Please don't discount traditional stories and oral histories because it does much more than just keep truth from being written; it destroys truth in the minds of tribal people and removes the confidence we are taught to have in the knowledge of our elders.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2005 Ballet Austin premiered a contemporary ballet choreographed by artistic director Stephen Mills based on the life of Holocaust survivor Naomi Warren. The ballet premiered a couple of weeks before the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, which Warren survived along with Auschwitz-Birkenau and Ravensbrück. Since then, the ballet has been performed across the US as well as in Italy, Slovenia, and Israel; it has won numerous awards, including one from the Anti-Defamation league; and is the subject of three documentaries. All of this exposure sheds a light on how Warren's testimony inspired Mills to make the piece [SLIDE], and, more importantly, how he used "dance as a convener of conversation around issues related to the protection of human rights against bigotry and hate." In this paper, I will focus on Mills's project to make the case for testimony dance as a vital approach to Holocaust representation and memory work. Light/The Holocaust and Humanity Project utilized testimony to mobilize Holocaust history, creating visceral connections between past and present in the interest of engaging and activating audiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Reframing Japonisme: Women and the Asian Art Market in Nineteenth-Century France  Elizabeth Emery, PhD, Professor of French at Montclair State University, will speak about her new book, Reframing Japonisme: Women and the Asian Art Market in Nineteenth-Century France, 1853–1914 (Bloomsbury Visual Arts, 2020). This Zoom webinar will be moderated by Rachel Saunders, PhD, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Curator of Asian Art at Harvard Art Museums, and recently elected member of the JASA Board of Directors.  Although 19th- and early 20th-century women collectors actively bequeathed Japanese works to major museums like the Louvre, the Musée Guimet, the Musée Cernuschi and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Japonisme has long been considered the province of a small group of elite men. Dr. Emery's book tells the forgotten stories of French women travelers, salon hostesses, writers, actresses and collectors who engaged with Japanese art alongside their better-known male contemporaries.  In her talk for JASA, Dr. Emery will bring attention to a few of the figures discussed in the book, using Japanese works they once knew to tell their stories. Clémence d'Ennery (1823–1898), the founder of the Musée d'Ennery in Paris, which houses one of the largest collections of netsuke on permanent display, is a central figure. She began collecting Japanese and Chinese mythological creatures in the 1840s, built and decorated a house for them in the 1870s, and bequeathed the Paris-based "Musée d'Ennery" to the state as a free public museum in 1893. A friend of the Goncourt brothers and a fifty-year patron of Parisian dealers of Asian art, d'Ennery's struggles to gain recognition as a collector and curator serve as a lens through which to examine the collecting and display practices of other women of her day.

		<Abstract>This paper will discuss some lessons and challenges from the "Encoding the Archive" project, in which students work in teams to publish archival documents as part of a class on gender and early modern bodies at Northeastern University, taught by Professor Marina Leslie. Each student encodes an individual document according to the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative, but the teams make collective decisions about how to handle regularization, annotation, and representation of document structures and features. Student teams also decide how to display their documents online and author a group editorial declaration. This model allows students to contextualize their individual documents and encourages them to become invested in the editorial process, as they must reach consensus about many potential approaches to modeling and publishing their texts. This paper will share the project's design considerations, adjustments over several iterations, student feedback and outcomes, and potential adaptations for other contexts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing on the work of the Women Writers Project (http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu), this presentation will explore the ways in which digital models and representation systems serve as proxies for human reading, or as intermediaries in that process. How do models such as text markup and algorithmic analysis such as word embedding models operate in dialogue with the written "source" text? How do we read these models, and how do these models themselves operate as readers? (And what is a "model"?) We'll examine the Restoration-era women's texts from Women Writers Online and also data about the materials read by these authors, building on the WWP's  current "Word Vectors for the Thoughtful Humanist" Institutes and recently completed "Intertextual Networks" grant that explores how women cite and make use of what they read.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the spring of 200 B.C., when the Athenians declared war on Philip V of Macedon, they voted to destroy statues and inscriptions for Philip and his ancestors (Livy 32.44.4-6). This decision also led to the excising of references to the Macedonian kings and their family in inscriptions. In an important essay, Byrne (2010) reconsidered this material, but he focused on the political circumstances surrounding the events; earlier scholars also concentrated on the historical and political ramifications of this episode (e.g. Habicht 1982: 147-150; Flower 2006: 34-40). They did not ask what this material can tell us about how readers and viewers interacted with these texts. As I shall argue, these erasures show clearly that these inscriptions were expected to be read. The erasures also changed the texts and thus the imagery of the individuals involved. While some changes were benign, others dramatically altered how viewers would engage with the text and understand the imagery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cultural repositories are increasingly tapping into the collective expertise of an interested public via crowdsourcing to improve the intellectual accessibility of handwritten sources and nourish their archival records . However, few are discussing the subsequent preservation and ethical re-use of these citizen contributions in the archival record and scholarship. We do not consider citizen contributors as simply a "sourced crowd;" they are often experts in the subject matter represented in these primary sources, and their collective scholarship (i.e. transcriptions,translations, indexes) is worthy of preservation. Our goal is to configure workflows for the preservation of these collectively-produced resources. We believe that every individual who contributes to the interpretation and understanding of our collections should be given credit for their efforts in the archival record and in scholarship. Based on ethical and practical considerations, our aim is to develop use statements and citation guides for scholars re-using citizen contributions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Office of Digital Humanities-funded project arises from the growing consensus that the digital humanities needs to do more to promote and support cultural and linguistic diversity. In order to provide an avenue for non-English literate communities to meaningfully engage and contribute to the digital humanities, we completed the interface internationalization and translation of an open source digital scholarship platform–FromThePage. FromThePage (FtP) is a tool for the collaborative transcription, translation, and indexing of primary source materials, particularly those that are handwritten or not readable by optical character recognition (OCR) technologies. Cultural repositories are increasingly using FtP to tap into the collective expertise of an interested public to improve the intellectual accessibility of handwritten sources and nourish their archival records. However, our research shows that few institutions have considered the subsequent preservation and ethical attribution of these citizen contributions in the archival record and scholarship. Part two of this project seeks to enhance FromThePage's collection management capabilities and exports to facilitate the development of workflows for preserving and adequately attributing collaborative scholarship for its ethical reuse. Our immediate goal for undertaking this work is twofold: 1) to break down barriers to access University of Texas Libraries' Spanish and Portuguese-language digital collections that have resulted from anglocentric technology stacks, and 2) to collaborate with current Latin American partners in the interpretation of their digitized collections hosted on our servers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this context, she considered ancient puppetry performances at ancient Greek festivals, and collected evidence of ancient Greek puppets in literary and epigraphical sources. She found her way to puppets whilst working on an archaeological project in Sicily and discovered the thriving puppeteering traditions of the island. Dr. Skotheim is currently preparing a book manuscript on festivals, covering the history of Greek dramatic performance in the Roman era, from ca. 200 BCE to 517 CE. For the 2019/20 academic year, Skotheim holds a Frances A. Yates Fellowship at the Warburg Institute in London where she is also working on her next book project, Radical Dancers: A Cultural and Intellectual History of Pantomime. This new work considers the cultural and intellectual impact of pantomime dance from its origins in the first century BCE through its afterlife in the 18th century, in the performing arts (ballet and harlequinade), visual art and aesthetics, rhetoric, language theory (including sign language), gesture, and the construction of a history of ancient and modern dance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In September 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricanes Irma and María, causing great devastation throughout the Archipelago. The repercussions of this atmospheric event have made recovery in libraries, archives and museums slow and difficult. In addition, it has required the review of the practices implemented to date to efficiently safeguard the resources for which they are responsible and ensure their continuous access. Such is the case of the Library of the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus, which lacked a program dedicated to the care of collections and disaster management before the event. Although they suffered the impact of the hurricanes, thanks to a rapid response, they managed to mitigate the damage quickly and secure emergency funds to train personnel and stabilize the impacted collections. In addition, this experience gave way to recognizing a new post-Maria scenario, and a new project arises in the institution in order to improve the capacity for prevention, mitigation, preparation, response and recovery. In order to inspire other colleagues in the face of the continuing threat from natural disasters in our region, this poster will share the strategies implemented for the establishment of a preservation program, with emphasis on: the formation of a work team with the collaboration and mentoring of experts, staff training, climate control and monitoring activities, the process of evaluation and re-storage of affected resources, and the development of an emergency plan for collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The excavations at Salapia, on the Adriatic Coast of Puglia in southern Italy, have revealed the remains of the Late Antique town and early medieval reoccupation. Over this timeframe, the character of the town changed, with buildings of the Roman and early Late Antique phase repurposed for huts made of organic materials.

		<Abstract>Excavations at Salapia, on the Adriatic Coast of Puglia in southern Italy, have revealed the remains of the Late Antique town and early medieval reoccupation. Over this timeframe, the character of the town changed, with buildings of the Roman and early Late Antique phase repurposed for huts made of organic materials. The residents of Salapia were apparently negotiating new ways of inhabiting the urban fabric, prompted by transformations within the community, that merit further investigation. To illuminate these complex dynamics of spatial organization and daily life further, I add a detailed analysis of the common ware ceramics recovered from contexts securely dated from the fourth to seventh centuries CE. Through a comparison of the ware forms that define these assemblages, one notes that they remained quite qualitatively and quantitatively consistent over time, as did the standard of production. Large basins, sometimes richly decorated, pitchers, table amphorae, and small jars and bowls, made up the "kit" of both table service and storage over these centuries. That these wares were produced locally by artisans who were possibly members of this community, allowed them to reflect both the tastes and needs of Salapia's inhabitants within a broader regional milieu. While scholars studying other Apulian contexts have placed interpretative emphasis on the minor variations in typology that occurred in local wares above all in the seventh century, linking them to the arrival of the Lombards, Salapia's table ceramics speak more pointedly to continuity, even across the decades when southern Italy's political circumstances were most in flux. Additionally, both the production and use of these wares perhaps attest to the solidity of social ties, marked by a common interest in sustaining artisans, and the shared experience of using the same vessels at table on a daily basis, even as the town slowly lost its urban character.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the late seventeenth century, a vibrant trade of coins and medallions was taking place across Europe. Cast in an assortment of metals and alloys, these medals depicted events of national significance such as the signing of a peace treaty or the marriage of a sovereign. These coins circulated throughout Europe where they were collected, traded, and sometimes satirized by rival nations. In France, medals were issued to amplify the glory of the King Louis XIV and his reign. Yet in addition to battles and monuments, coins were also cast to commemorate the triumphs of science. In particular, the activities and discoveries of the young Académie royale des sciences in Paris – from their discovery of new moons to the construction of the observatory – became immortalized in numerous medals. The materiality of the coins, in particular the value and durability of the metal, meant they had the ability to travel to a greater degree than other more delicate or ephemeral objects of the Academy. These medals had multiple functions as they circulated both within the walls of the Academy, and in   philosophical and aristocratic circles abroad. The visual allegories and events depicted on the coins were also copied into different formats including printed books and other medals. This paper will explore the coins and medals created on behalf of the French Scientific Academy – what they depicted, how they were used, and why scientific activity became memorialized in metal. This paper will also consider the materiality and mobility of these objects, and how they were dispersed and replicated in service of science and the French state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Instruments are abundant in the visual imagery created by the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, the first scientific society of France. From its foundation in 1666 under King Louis XIV, the Academy's visual products – including paintings, drawings, prints, and coins – repeatedly depicted numerous scientific instruments. Sometimes the instrument portrayed was a specific apparatus developed and used by the Academy such as Christiaan Huygens's pendulum clock; in other instances, a generalized flask or scope stood in for a category of device. Yet, these instruments often had much larger meanings within the work of art, and these meanings varied depending on the work's intended audience.   This paper will explore the instruments depicted in the visual culture of the French Royal Academy of Sciences, and how these instruments contributed to an iconography of natural philosophy developing at the time. In particular, it will look at how this iconography became part of the visual strategy deployed by young Academy during the late seventeenth century. This paper will seek to answer questions including why instruments were given precious visual real estate in the small space of a print or coin? And, in an image laden with epistemic and political messages, what did these instruments mean? Drawing from a range of archival and printed primary sources, this paper will reveal the important role of instruments in the visual culture of early modern science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Given the Electoral College remains prone to problematic election results, it is surprising the conventional view is the ratification debates produced few criticisms of it. Alexander Hamilton and James Wilson claimed few objected (Hamilton 2001; Merill 1978, 565-566). Scholars reinforce the view (Main 1961; Ellis 1999; Milkis and Nelson 2020).  I used a content analysis of ratification records for eight of the original thirteen colonies to show this was not the case. Criticisms included that the Electoral College is too complex, leaves the president too distant from the people, can produce an elective monarchy or despotism, and is prone to domestic and foreign intrigue (Rogers 2010). Now all 13 colonies are available through The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution (DHRC), so the content analysis can be completed. New in this work is an explanation of how the criticisms of the Electoral College exemplify two of the three strands of Anti-Federalist thought (power Anti-Federalism and Democratic Anti-Federalism) Faber identifies (2019). As for audience, the manuscript will be of interest to colonial era and presidential scholars in history and political science. Both will find a comprehensive documentation of founding criticisms of the Electoral College. Beyond that, a more general audience interested in reforming and/or eliminating the Electoral College will learn some criticisms of the institution today were raised during ratification.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2019 NFPB Diversity Task Force in collaboration with AMIA evaluated the state of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of audiovisual archiving. This evaluation has made clear that the profession must take major steps to become more equitable, inclusive and representative of the communities it serves and the histories it shepherds. As of 2020 there are several programs addressing these concerns, including WGBH's Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship (PBPF) and the associated EBSCO Scholarships at University of Alabama, The AMIA Diversity and Inclusion Fellowship Program (ADIFP), and BAVC's Community-based Preservation Education and Training program (CPET). A panel made up of representatives from each program will discuss the achievements, hurdles, and strategies of their respective programs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How did knowledge—in both elite and popular forms—move across land, seas, and oceans before the onset of modern globalization? And how did the transmission of knowledge interplay with long-distance trade routes, flows of commodities, capital, and other forms of economic and diplomatic exchange?  This panel puts into conversation a set of comparative but concrete case studies of the transmission of knowledge that spans the maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the South China Seas in the late middle ages. It defines knowledge and the mode of its circulation very broadly, as participants explore how secular, religious, and cultural knowledge was transmitted from a variety of methodological tools: archeology of shipwrecks, textual studies of medical literature, the history of painting, and the diplomatic history of Venetian-Ottoman relations. In doing so, this panel should attract a wide audience of pre-modern historians working across a number of regions and scholarly approaches.  One through-line that can be found in each of the panelists' presentations—which will be an informal discussion of works-in-progress—is the role played by Islamic historical actors and institutions in shuttling knowledge around the globe. Another commonality shared across these studies is that the finding that the transmission of objects—gifts, commodities, books, and portraits—also required the transmission of knowledge and expertise on the meanings and functions of those objects in the new regions and cultures to which they were transported.  This panel will conclude with a comment from a leading scholar in the field who will respond to the themes that connect the individual papers as well as interrogate the framework of ‘the Global Middle Ages' itself. This framework was recently proposed in by the journal Medieval Globe, founded in 2014, and then again in a recent thematic volume of Past and Present, 238:13 (2018).

		<Abstract>The lives of non-elites, especially non-elite children, in ancient Greece are significantly understudied. This study investigates a sample of 45 of Jar Burials from Phaleron Cemetery in Athens, Greece, in order to understand the health outcomes of non-elite infants and young children during the Archaic Period (ca. 700-480 BCE). Our goals include determining whether infants at Phaleron survived beyond the first few weeks after birth and whether they survived long enough to elicit a bony response to physiological stress. To address these questions, age-at-death was estimated using standard methods based on dental and skeletal development. Pathological bony changes in the cranium and postcranium were also recorded.  Although most infants survived birth and lived beyond the first few weeks after birth, approximately 20% died within two weeks of birth and 67% after two weeks, but before the age of 2. For the 36 individuals for whom dental age estimation was possible, the largest number of individuals died between 3 and 9 months of age. Also, 29% of 45 individuals lived with chronic physiological stress suficiently long to elicit a bony response. These results suggest that the Jar Burials represent children who were accepted into their family after birth but were unable to survive early life physiological stressors. Furthermore, the presence of bony responses to physiological stress suggests that, for at least some of these individuals, stressors were chronic, rather than acute.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scurvy is caused by inadequate levels of vitamin C in the diet. Thus, evidence for infantile scurvy in past populations provides a unique window into both early childhood and maternal diets. This study aims to identify the presence of metabolic diseases, such as scurvy, among non-elite children in ancient Athens. Macroscopic examination of 45 infant Jar Burials interred in the Archaic Greek cemetery of Phaleron (Athens, Greece; 700-480 BCE) revealed pathological bony changes in the cranium and postcranium of multiple individuals consistent with prolonged nutritional stress. Most of the bony changes observed in this sample were non-specific; however, bony changes observed in burial 5 154, an infant who died between 6 and 13 months of age, were diagnosed as scurvy using the "Ortner criteria" of cranial and postcranial lesions. Cranial bony changes were observed bilaterally in the frontal, zygomatic, sphenoid, parietal, temporals, and occipital, bones, as well as the maxillae and mandible. Furthermore, abnormal postcranial changes affected all long bone metaphyses, the scapulae and ilia. The young age-at-death for this individual and additional evidence for delays in long-bone growth suggest that prolonged nutritional stress would have begun while the infant should have been solely breastfeeding, implying that vitamin C deficiency and nutritional stress were experienced not only by this individual, but by their mother or wet nurse as well.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Molecular biology is the most self-conscious, most memoired, most mythologized science perhaps ever, and it has its Scriptures. For better and/or worse, James Watson's bestselling memoir, The Double Helix (1968), undergirds all our histories of molecular biology. Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology (or PATOOMB), the 1966 festschrift for Max Delbrück, edited by Watson, Gunther Stent, and John Cairns and published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, established another foundational narrative of molecular biology, the idea that the "phage group," led by Max Delbrück, was the social nucleus from which molecular biology sprang. Watson's contribution to the volume, "Growing up in the phage group" cemented that narrative and located Cold Spring Harbor as the crucible from which molecular biology sprang. Historians have also noted that Watson's 1965 Molecular Biology of the Gene, the first textbook of molecular biology, was seminal in bounding, setting the parameters of, and establishing a language for the new science. Receiving at most a footnote in most accounts is that, also in 1968, Watson became director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory—in fact within weeks of the release of The Double Helix. Further, in Watson's famous contribution to PATOOMB, "Growing up in the phage group," he refers obliquely to The Double Helix. The archives reveal that, in fact, these events dovetailed, interlaced, co-constructed one another. Moreover, Watson's appointment as director of CSHL was the culmination of at least six years of intensive involvement with Lab politics, in which he brought Cairns to CSHL as director, advised him regularly during his short tenure, and, when things fell apart, worked to find Cairns a graceful and remunerative exit. In short, all of these events—writing the textbook, the memoir, the creation of "the phage group" as the origin and Cold Spring Harbor the crucible of the new biology, and Watson's patient process of becoming director—were components of</Abstract>

In our current research, therefore, we privilege the complex terrain as a key determinant in the construction of sacred space and ritual experience ; we focus on the significance of connective spaces and passages joining key regions of the Sanctuary ; and we recognize the interplay of local and imported construction materials as a vital component in the economic, political, and design network of the Sanctuary. In this seminar, we present how our recent work in petrography, archaeology, and 3D modeling have helped to reshape our understanding of the Sanctuary.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Sanctuary of the Great Gods on the island of Samothrace is one of the most important sanctuaries of the ancient Greek world, used as a sacred space from the 7th century BCE into the Roman Empire. Famous for its initiation rituals, the site presents one of the richest architectural landscapes of the Aegean, famous not only for its Archaic development, but also for its continued development into the Hellenistic and Roman periods.  In this lecture, Dr. Bonna Wescoat, current director of excavations at Samothrace, will discuss new insights on how that sacred space was used and how visitors experienced the sanctuary</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The late Egyptian theatre critic Nehad Selaiha once described the various levels of censorship in the Arabian Gulf as so suffocating as to burden theatre-makers with "a feeling of being incarcerated, besieged and having to speak through metaphors and symbols." Bahraini scholar Ibrahim Abdullah Ghalloom has likewise argued that censorship by government officials has robbed theatre of its ability to challenge existing pieties; theatre is permitted to exist only to "consolidate the status quo, be it religious, political, or ethical." These claims are borne out in my interviews with the region's theatre practitioners, who lament the knee-jerk reactions of official censors to any script that even touches upon the topics of religion, sex, or politics. Under such circumstances, Shakespeare—whose plays decidedly do not shy away from presenting those topics—provides a rich source of inspiration, while the cultural cachet that adheres to his works allows theatre-makers a degree of protection from official censorship. This paper will examine the ways in which recent adaptations from the region use Shakespeare as, in the words of British-Kuwaiti playwright Sulayman Al Bassam, a form of "body armour" against "the censor's whip," allowing for instances of incisive socio-political critique that would otherwise be suppressed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Emerging media technologies like virtual reality, augmented reality, and interactive 360 video are providing new mediums for visual storytelling and experiential learning at historical and heritage sites. We are conducting research on using augmented reality for an educational tour of historic Mitchelville Freedom Park, the site of the first Freedmen's town during the Civil War and Gullah heritage site on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Augmented reality applications enable us to integrate 3D virtual structures and animated historical figures like Harriet Tubman and Robert Smalls into the camera feed of mobile phones and headsets, so that visitors can experience life-sized interactive scenes throughout the park. Maraffi's presentation shows pre-production designs, models, and augmented reality prototypes which are in development for Mitcheville AR Tour: Stories of Emancipation &amp;amp; Freedom. FAU faculty and students are using the latest technology in virtual cinematic production and games AI to develop life-sized tour guides that will feature Gullah storytelling and dance, as well as put Mitchelville within the context of the Port Royal Experiment and the larger humanities themes of Reconstruction and Civil Rights. By collaborating with preservationists, humanities scholars, computer scientists, and Gullah performing artists from many institutions, including the Mitchelville Preservation Project, Penn Center, Reconstruction Beaufort, USCB, NCSU, CCU, and the Gullah community, faculty and graduate students in FAU's Media, Technology, and Entertainment MFA program are researching new ways to make the history and culture surrounding Mitchelvlle come alive. This project is being funded by a National Endowment for the Humanities Digital Projects for the Public "Discovery" grant, and an FAU Walter and Lalita Janke Emerging Technologies Fund seed grant.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From the late eleventh century, Turcoman tribes occupied a substantial portion of the countryside in &amp;#x0D; central, southern and eastern Anatolia. They wanted to preserve their traditional tribal autonomy and loathed any strict central administration. Although they were Muslims, most rejected Sunni understanding of Islam and maintained some of their pre-Islamic religion and practices. Throughout the 16 th&amp;#x0D;  century, the Safavid movement gained the support of many of these Turcoman tribes and grew thanks to their economic and military contribution. Because of this affiliation with the Safavid movement, these Turcoman tribes were called kizilbas (lit. red head) after the headgear designed by the leader of the Safavid order Haydar (d. 1488). &amp;#x0D; In  addition  to  military  fight,  the  Ottoman  government  sustained  an  ideological  campaign  against  the  kizilbas during  the 16th century.  In  this  context,  the  fatwas  and  treatises,  which  were  composed  by  Ottoman  scholar-bureaucrats and concerned the evaluation of the beliefs and practices of the kizilbas from the Sunni religio-legal perspective, played a significant role in the demarcation of ideological lines between two sides.  Scholar-bureaucrats came up with two verdicts about the kizilbas:  unbelief  (kufr/küfür)  and  apostasy  (irtidad).    In  their  opinion,  the  first,  unbelief,  mainly  concerned  religious  beliefs  and  &amp;#x0D; practices, while the second, apostasy, was related to political attitudes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The question of whether instructors in Islamic history should bring their current research into the undergraduate classroom can raise ambivalent feelings. Success is not guaranteed: students could find the reading and discussion of cutting-edge research arcane, especially in the pre-modern period; the materials might not have a good fit with the existing pedagogy of courses we have constructed (or inherited from others); or we may not be fully secure about our translation or presentation of novel sources. This roundtable presentation presents three case studies of ongoing research that I have recently integrated into my undergraduate survey courses on the history of Islamic civilization, their benefits, and the reasons why I think such concerns may prove overblown.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores the efforts of the Ottoman central government in Istanbul to regulate the corsairing activities of the perennially disobedient port cities of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli and to define what constituted a legally permissible (halal) raid. From the late 15th century onward, the diplomatic instruments that regulated peaceful relations between the Ottomans and the Venetians, the ahdnames, contained clauses prohibiting piracy and the enslavement of each other's subjects. Similar articles made their way into the ahdnames subsequently concluded with France, England, and the Netherlands. By the 17th century, however, the sultan's nominal subjects in North Africa were regularly violating these provisions, with Tunisian and Algerian corsairs routinely attacking Venetian ships and raiding Venetian shores in contravention of the treaty and over the objections of Ottoman officials in Istanbul.&amp;#x0D; Even as the Atlantic powers concluded treaties directly with the North African port cities beginning in the 1620s, meant to spare them from attack and redirect it towards their rivals, Venice continued to seek redress exclusively from Istanbul.&amp;#x0D; Drawing on an array of Ottoman and Venetian archival and manuscript sources, this paper surveys the damage done to Venetian interests in the Ottoman Mediterranean by piratical attacks in the first half of the 17th century, and it explores the ways in which Ottoman jurists and administrators attempted – through fatwas and decrees rather than by force – to counter the claims of Tunisian and Algerian corsairs that the principles of retaliation, custom and Islamic law gave them the right to attack Venetian targets, irrespective of what the sultan's ahdname promised.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Turkyilmaz engaged in a conversation on the genealogies of fundamental problems in various forms of writing the history of the Armenian Genocide, namely teleology, archival fetishism and obsession with meta-narratives.  Locating these historiographical issues within broader debates on violence, trauma and memory-building, the discussion proposes ways of rethinking historical research design and narrative formation for nuanced, that is conceptually poignant and methodologically accommodating, analyses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using a case study of a murder that took place in Van, eastern Anatolia, Türkyilmaz's discusses the nature of political tension and debate among Armenians on the eve of the genocide.  His analysis here goes beyond deterministic, escalationist and teleological perspectives on the antecedents of the Armenian genocide; instead, it highlights political agency and enabling structures of the war, offering a new perspective on the tragic violence of Eastern Anatolia in the early twentieth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Yektan Türkyilmaz revisits the most controversial site of the Armenian genocide, the province of Van between April and August 1915, and explores the political agendas and militaristic/strategic decisions that led to the total destruction of this historic Ottoman city. Van was the epicenter of the Armenian genocide, the place where it incubated. Paradoxically, however, genocide as such did not occur in the city/province; as the entire power structure in Van swiftly and radically changed hands between rival empires multiple times in a matter of a few months. Van in 1915 was a distinctive space within the larger devastating landscape of the Armenian genocide, one where myriad experiences, agendas, and actors clashed without any single dynamic or force establishing its unquestioned hegemony. Yet the city Van was the site and victim of an urbicide par excellence. All parties involved in the process targeted the city Van—its infrastructure, residential areas, government buildings, market place, military buildings, communication facilities, and foreign missions. Drawing on Armenian, Ottoman and Russian archival documents, periodicals, memoirs, photographic and cartographic materials and secondary sources his research investigates the ideological/symbolic and militaristic/strategic decisions that led to urbicide in Van and the continuing memory politics around it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Piracy proved to be one of the defining issues in Ottoman-Venetian relations. More than any other concern, rampant piracy threatened commerce and the peace and sent innumerable diplomats, messengers, dispatches, and funds back and forth across the eastern half of the Mediterranean basin. Anti-piracy articles appeared in every commercial treaty (known as ahdname) the two powers concluded from 1482 onward. Based on analysis of the original treaty documents, Ottoman decrees, letters and Venetian ambassadorial dispatches, this paper focuses on the gradual evolution of the diplomatic and legal framework through which Ottoman and Venetian authorities dealt with incidents of unauthorized piracy involving their subjects over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. &amp;#x0D; Combining maritime custom, negotiation, and the legal traditions of both sides, Istanbul and Venice constructed a platform of codes of conduct at sea, expectations for how to deal with pirates, and a formal system for providing restitution for damages and the return of their illegally enslaved subjects. In so doing, Ottomans and Venetians created a new body of maritime law that laid the groundwork for principles that would become enshrined in modern international law.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, issues regarding morality became "a burning issue of the day" for the Ottoman society.  Morality gained a new political charge, where the moral and political realms overlapped with a new set of practices and norms.  Revitalization of a classical genre, morality books, takes place in this context. More than a hundred books published on morality attests to the fact that morality became one of expanding/transforming fields of knowledge. &amp;#x0D; As the Empire went through a nation-and-state formation process, Ottoman moralists placed an original emphasis on work, making it a central issue not only for the moral development of the individual but also for the advancement of the nation in general, articulating normative dimensions of citizenship.  They fortified their argumentations by referencing Islam's symbolic universe.  They adamantly opposed beliefs and practices that are identified as handicaps for productivity by declaring them un-Islamic and anti-progress. Could this phenomenon of moralized and popularized discourses of productivity be seen as merely a Western content filling the Islamic forms?  More specifically, how would examining morality books as cultural factors enable us to understand the connection between Islamic discourses and establishing modern and &amp;#x0D; moralizing narratives, especially about work ethics of citizenry?  The assumption that takes Islam and modernity as static notions does not explain the wealth of Ottoman experience. This presentation attempts to explore the question of morality, religion, and modernity by engaging with a very specific historic period and its sources.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Symposium Abstract: This two-day international symposium was inspired by the important collections of British portraits at the Huntington Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art, and by an upsurge of scholarly interest in the interactive nature of portraiture—both in its intrinsic character and as a curatorial construct. Portraiture implies an interaction between the sitter and the spectator. It often rehearses an interaction between two or more protagonists and regularly focuses on the interaction between the person(s) represented, and his/her or their surroundings. The same portrait, or portraits of the same sitter, can also find themselves interacting with each other across different media—paint, print sculpture, and more. Furthermore, curators are continually thinking about the ways in which the portraits they display—and the individuals these pictures portray—relate with each other across and around a gallery. This symposium, was jointly organized by the Yale Center for British Art, the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Encompassing the Issos, Iskenderun, and Arsuz plains of southeastern Cilicia, the Bay of Iskenderun Archaeology Project documented nearly 200 archaeological sites during six seasons of survey (2004-2009).  It represents the first large-scale, multi-season, and systematic archaeological investigation of this region.  The survey's goals included the compilation of an inventory of archaeological remains in an area experience rapid urban and commercial development, together with the examination of the region as an interface of cultural exchange between the Mediterranean, Anatolia, and the Levant.  A wide variety of extensive and intensive survey techniques were employed to identify and map observable archaeological features.  A discussion and evaluation of these combined approaches, their effectiveness, and implications for heritage management are discussed in this paper.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A common task in qualitative data analysis&amp;#x0D; is to characterize the usage of a linguistic&amp;#x0D; entity by issuing queries over syntactic&amp;#x0D; relations between words. Previous interfaces&amp;#x0D; for searching over syntactic structures&amp;#x0D; require programming-style queries.&amp;#x0D; User interface research suggests that it is&amp;#x0D; easier to recognize a pattern than to compose&amp;#x0D; it from scratch; therefore, interfaces&amp;#x0D; for non-experts should show previews of&amp;#x0D; syntactic relations. What these previews&amp;#x0D; should look like is an open question that&amp;#x0D; we explored with a 400-participant Mechanical&amp;#x0D; Turk experiment. We found&amp;#x0D; that syntactic relations are recognized with&amp;#x0D; 34% higher accuracy when contextual examples&amp;#x0D; are shown than a baseline of naming&amp;#x0D; the relations alone. This suggests&amp;#x0D; that user interfaces should display contextual&amp;#x0D; examples of syntactic relations to help&amp;#x0D; users choose between different relations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We describe WordSeer, a tool whose goal is to help scholars&amp;#x0D; and analysts discover patterns and formulate and test&amp;#x0D; hypotheses about the contents of text collections, midway&amp;#x0D; between what humanities scholars call a traditional "close&amp;#x0D; read" and the new "distant read" or "culturomics" approach.&amp;#x0D; To this end, WordSeer allows for highly flexible "slicing and&amp;#x0D; dicing" (hence "sliding") across a text collection. The tool&amp;#x0D; allows users to view text from different angles by selecting&amp;#x0D; subsets of data, viewing those as visualizations, moving laterally&amp;#x0D; to view other subsets of data, slicing into another view,&amp;#x0D; expanding the viewed data by relaxing constraints, and so&amp;#x0D; on. We illustrate the text sliding capabilities of the tool&amp;#x0D; with examples from a case study in the field of humanities&amp;#x0D; and social sciences – an analysis of how U.S. perceptions of&amp;#x0D; China and Japan changed over the last 30 years.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When European optical devices were first introduced into early modern East Asia, these devices affected not only viewing experiences and ideas about vision, but also the production of art. In contrast to the well-established effects on Japanese art, the effects on Chinese art have barely been explored, in part because the science of optics did not develop significantly in China prior to the mid-nineteenth century. Yet from the seventeenth century onward, Qing domestic production and use of optical devices resulted in significant relationships with art at the imperial, elite, and popular levels. The devices and the viewing experiences that they mediated created varying levels of foreign intervention into Chinese art, vision, and visuality. However, the consistent but diverse methods of Sinification of all these elements and the reliance on domestic products rather than imports offers new insights into how Qing art engaged the West without being limited to either the court or the capital. Through an art-historical case study of several different optical devices and their related works of art that are all linked through one particular type of magnifying lens, this presentation examined how the production and consumption of these new objects and images varied by place, format, audience, and social status.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the first time, archaeological data from excavations at The Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's nineteenth-century cotton plantation near Nashville, Tennessee, are being made available to researchers through the Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery (DAACS). These assemblages are associated primarily with enslaved laborers who lived in three Antebellum quartering areas on the plantation. Building on previous research about slaves' acquisition of non-provisioned goods, this poster interrogates one subset of these data, imported ceramics, to assess the distribution of goods across the spatially-divided enslaved community. First, we establish a plantation-wide chronology using correspondence analysis to date deposits from the mansion backyard, outlying field quarters, and the First Hermitage, the earliest settled area of the plantation. We then review how specialized forms and decorated vessels varied across time and space between the three domestic areas, and whether this variation reflects relative investment in market goods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Variation in enslaved people's access to goods has been interpreted spatially as a result of proximity or distance from the owner's main house. In this poster, we evaluate these conclusions with data from Andrew Jackson's Hermitage plantation. Recent analysis by DAACS of the collections excavated from slave quarter assemblages indicates five phases of occupation across the Hermitage property. In light of this fine-grained chronology, we explore the influence of Jackson's program of housing standardization and the proximity of domestic contexts to the mansion on enslaved people's access to market goods. Specifically, we examine whether diversity in the decorative techniques and elements on ceramics acquired by enslaved people shifts as a result of these two variables. This detailed temporal and spatial analysis is possible through the specific, attribute-based recording of decoration called for in DAACS protocols.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In his nine-volume record of conversations with Whitman in the last years of the poet's life, published as With Walt Whitman in Camden, Horace Traubel and the poet joke about Traubel's collecting—not just the poet's words, but also his letters and manuscripts, even retrieving some of the latter out of the trash in Whitman's house on Mickle Street.  Traubel's volumes have been cited as evidence of Whitman's responses to a range of topics, from politics to poetry.  Lacking from the conversation, however, is a sense of Traubel as collector.  In the course of drafting his meticulous notes, Traubel also created an elaborate indexing system, noting at the top of the letters and manuscripts Whitman gave him the locations of corresponding transcriptions in his notes.  The Whitman Archive is currently engaged in the first comprehensive effort to publish Whitman's early prose manuscripts and his incoming correspondence, bringing several of the manuscripts and letters marked by Traubel to light.  Traubel's notes link individual documents to a rich context of conversations between Whitman and Traubel and Traubel's own efforts to create an archive of documents related to the poet.  They also offer an occasion to consider the role of a nineteenth-century collection of manuscripts within a twenty-first century digital archive.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Walt Whitman Archive aims to foster the poet's catalytic presence in contemporary culture by making his vast work freely accessible to scholars, students, and general readers. Our site is built using non-proprietary technologies and a Creative Commons license that allows free re-use of our work. Last month the Whitman Archive was accessed by 36,000 unique users from more than 150 countries on six continents. With NEH funding, we are making the first systematic attempt to document the entirety of Whitman's prose writings. Our project includes descriptions and facsimile images of over 500 items.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In April 2011, the University of Missouri-Kansas City's Marr Sound Archives was the recipient of a National Endowment for the Humanities grant to preserve and catalog the nearly 2,000 lacquer and transcription discs in the Arthur B. Church KMBC Radio Collection. KMBC, a CBS-affiliated station in Kansas City, was established in 1927 by Arthur B. Church, the broadcasting pioneer responsible for several syndicated radio shows including The Texas Rangers, Phenomenon, and Brush Creek Follies. The sound recordings in the collection are a treasure trove of local and national history from the late 1930s through the 1940s, revealing the American experience during wartime through news broadcasts, political speeches, musical entertainment, rural comedies, and radio soap operas. Coupled with the sound recordings were a large number of stampers--metal plates used to press or "stamp" grooves onto plastic to produce vinyl records. These manufacturing parts contain a wealth of musical performances by the Texas Rangers, Tex Owens, Bonnie King, Tune Chasers, and Harry Jenks that had been hidden in our collection, and possibly others. We determined that in order to transfer the audio from these metal stampers, a special stylus would need to be acquired. As these particular styli are difficult to manufacture, we found ourselves in a "waiting game." With the impending deadline arose a new concern: How do we discover and provide access to content from these obsolete metal plates? In this poster, we demonstrate the multi-faceted process used to leverage existing resources and acquire additional materials in the most cost-effective way in order to preserve and reveal the hidden contents of an obsolete format. We present the issues, outcomes, and unexpected discoveries that led us to successfully identify and provide access to the recordings in the KMBC Radio Collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Starting in the 1920s through the late 1950s, Kansas City-based broadcasting pioneer Arthur B. Church produced a broad range of syndicated radio programs including Phenomenon, The Brush Creek Follies and the Texas Rangers. The Texas Rangers were a particularly successful franchise, heard on over 100 of the 116 CBS affiliate stations. The eight-man choir played twenty different instruments between them, while garbed in western wear, topped, of course, with classic white hats. Their ability to traverse successfully between hymns, cowboy songs, novelty, and western swing demonstrates their incredible range as musicians both on their own show and on The Brush Creek Follies. Moreover, they displayed their acting skills in Night Time on the Trail and Life on Red Horse Ranch, broadcasts offering "thrills of the old west" that mixed drama, romance, comedy, and music. Skilled as they were, their formidable talents remain in relative obscurity. As part of an NEH-funded grant project, the University of Missouri--Kansas City University Libraries is bringing the Texas Rangers and their posse back to light! By providing bibliographic access and digital preservation to a collection of transcription discs, lacquer discs, and negative metal stampers that comprise the KMBC collection, radio aficionados will once again be able to delight in the antics of the Rangers. This session will provide an introduction to the KMBC-CBS Texas Rangers, and will feature both musical renditions and dramatic interpretations by these versatile performers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The course "Defining the Natural State" was the product of a 2015 NEH Enduring Questions Grant.  The course examines historic controversies and cultural interpretations surrounding the evolving meaning of ‘natural state', paying special attention to the beginnings of the cosmos, life and humanity. Approaches from cosmology, molecular biology, environmental science, anthropology and religion are considered, ending with a discussion of fundamentalism and sustainability as they pertain to defining "the natural state" in the twenty-first century.  Sustainability is a difficult word to define, but most assume it involves some stewardship of nature. However, whose "nature" do we mean, especially in an environment so changed by man that some geologists now label it the Anthropocene? Can we ever return to a natural state? Would we want to, given the very real social and biological stressors involved? Finally, given a fundamentalist inclination to return things to "the way they were" in politics, religion, and society, what will be our definition of a natural human state? Who will decide? Today the question "What is the Natural State" continues to bring in new permutations. Can we return to a natural state, or are we now so inextricably creatures of technology that such a return would doom millions? Why is fundamentalism so powerful in the twenty-first century? Do many want to revert to "the way it used to be" because the future terrifies them? Are people "naturally" competitors or sharers? How do we reconcile the biocentric and anthropocentric visions of the natural state? Has humanity changed the "natural state" too much for any return?  This course was not designed to answer these questions, but it has stimulated conversation and has challenged students to think about their own views of what is ‘natural' in century that will force hard choices about sustainablilty and fundamental stands on what is ‘naturally correct'.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>If we wish to understand what civility is, we need to see it in its origins, its emergence as a new moral character at the beginning of the modern era. This character was first displayed and given expression in the Essays of Michel de Montaigne. Civility is actually the overcoming of the will to power, the natural desire to dominate others, not a mask for covering over that natural political attitude. Without civility, there is only the will to power. And in order for civility to exist, there must be something higher, more important, than politics and the struggle for power. &amp;#x0D; I begin with a brief philosophical history of the virtue of civility. Then I address the question of what civility is and what the conditions are for a civil society. Finally, I take up the relationship between civility and liberal education.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The digital humanities have experienced tremendous growth within the last decade, mostly in the context of developing&amp;#x0D; computational tools that support what is called&amp;#x0D; distant reading&amp;#x0D; — collecting and analyzing huge amounts of textual data for synoptic&amp;#x0D; evaluation. On the other end of the spectrum is a practice at the heart of the traditional humanities,&amp;#x0D; close reading&amp;#x0D; — the careful,&amp;#x0D; in-depth analysis of a single text in order to extract, engage, and even generate as much productive meaning as possible. The true&amp;#x0D; value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question&amp;#x0D; with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design&amp;#x0D; study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool&amp;#x0D; for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology&amp;#x0D; probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive&amp;#x0D; impact technology can have on poetry scholarship. Finally, we also contribute a reflection on the challenges we faced conducting&amp;#x0D; visualization research in literary studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The analysis of sound and sonic devices in po-&amp;#x0D; etry is the focus of much poetic scholarship,&amp;#x0D; and poetry scholars are becoming increasingly&amp;#x0D; interested in the role that computation might&amp;#x0D; play  in  their  research.    Since  the  nature  of&amp;#x0D; such sonic analysis is unique,  the associated&amp;#x0D; tasks are not supported by standard text anal-&amp;#x0D; ysis techniques. We introduce a formalism for&amp;#x0D; analyzing sonic devices in poetry. In addition,&amp;#x0D; we present RhymeDesign, an open-source im-&amp;#x0D; plementation of our formalism, through which&amp;#x0D; poets and poetry scholars can explore their in-&amp;#x0D; dividual notion of rhyme.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars of the ancient world&amp;#x0D;     seeking to understand complex ancient landscapes (both natural&amp;#x0D;     and built) commonly use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to&amp;#x0D;     organize and analyze surveyed or excavated cultural data. GIS&amp;#x0D;     places archaeological information within a two-dimensional (2D)&amp;#x0D;     geospatial framework linked to real locations on the Earth's&amp;#x0D;     surface. Human lives are not lived, however, on a flat surface or&amp;#x0D;     plane, but are embedded within a three-dimensional world.&amp;#x0D;     Archaeologists seeking a more contextualized framework for their&amp;#x0D;     data must add a third coordinate, elevation or height, to their&amp;#x0D;     analysis. Additionally, change over time (the fourth dimension)&amp;#x0D;     is a fundamental aspect of human life, and necessary for any&amp;#x0D;     study that aims to understand human experience in the past. These&amp;#x0D;     elements – height and time – are often neglected in&amp;#x0D;     archaeological GIS projects. The project 3D Saqqara attempts to&amp;#x0D;     create a truly four-dimensional visualization of an ancient&amp;#x0D;     Egyptian site. The project presents a workflow for how 2D&amp;#x0D;     archaeological data can be transformed into 3D representations of&amp;#x0D;     ancient built and natural environments, maintaining the&amp;#x0D;     geo-spatial coordinate system of GIS and allowing for both&amp;#x0D;     quantitative and qualitative visual analysis.  While the project&amp;#x0D;     focuses on Egyptian material, such techniques can be applied by&amp;#x0D;     scholars of the ancient world interested in landscape and human&amp;#x0D;     perception in general.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>3D reconstruction models of complex, multi-layered archaeological sites allow scholars to investigate visibility and movement across time and space in now-disappeared ancient landscapes. Adding a 3rd and 4th dimension to traditional Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data creates new opportunities for considering re-imagined places through "subject-centered" viewpoints, considering human perspective, vision, and embodiment within the larger landscape. This paper describes how such 4D technologies are being utilized to investigate the creation of meaning in sacred landscapes at the ancient Egyptian site of Saqqara, a necropolis and cult site with occupation covering 3,000 years.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will report on extended reality (XR) research projects our media lab is doing to enhance informational posters, 3D exhibits, and tours at museums and historical sites. XR refers to media that is delivered through a game engine interface to mobile devices or headsets, including 360 video, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) or spatial computing experiences. We are collaborating with a science museum in Florida and a historical site in South Carolina to design interactive educational experiences that will better engage visitors for learning science and humanities topics. Projects include enhancing informational posters with documentary video and 3D animated renders, creating AR content that integrates with existing 3D site exhibits, and developing interactive docents and tour guides. We are taking a STEAM (STEM+Art) approach that draws from docudrama and edutainment media, using intermedial techniques from cinema, animation, and games. Technology includes performance capture for virtual production, 360 video, and photogrammetry to visualize believable 3D scenes in a real space.   In another project, we are collaborating with the Mitchelville Preservation Project in coastal Beaufort County, South Carolina, to create a tour of the Reconstruction-era historical and Gullah-Geechee heritage site. Mitchelville was the first Freedmen's town of formerly enslaved Africans, today known as Gullah-Geechee, during the US Civil War. We are creating an AR app for mobile phones that will tell histories related to Mitchelville and nearby sites. In the fall we did virtual pre-production for Harriet Tubman's Combahee River Raids, visualizing story elements using performance capture in the Unreal game engine, and will be developing a prototype for mobile devices and headsets in spring semester.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The interstitium, a network of fluid-filled spaces forming a coherent organ of translocation within the body, maps well onto our investigations of the Hellenistic Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace. The cognate interstitium of spaces, pathways, and viewscapes within the sanctuary share a similar flexible and connective coherence. Through examining experiential aspects of passages leading from the entrance to the Central Sanctuary, across the seasonal torrent, and to the theatre and terrace in front of the Stoa, we argue that the interstitial network within the sanctuary emerges as a critical mediator of the reciprocal relationships between architecture, landscape, and human actors in the construction of sacred space.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The island of Samothrace is the result of continuous tectonic activity in the Northern Aegean region and more specifically the Great Anatolian Fault that shears its southeastern margin.  This high energy environment formed a variety of rocks, many of which were used in the construction of the buildings in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. Establishing a system of classification has help clarify local building history.  Petrographic analysis correlates specific building sites with at least three island quarries.  The choice of construction stone was based on physical attributes and engineering properties. Limestones and dolomites with open cavities (vugs) were light weight yet strong and thus well suited for foundations, while basalt, trachyte, and rhyolite were mainly limited to the lowest level of foundations or large-scale polygonal retaining walls. The carbonates show varying degrees of post-installation weathering and degradation, most notably in the increased volume of cavities created by the plucking out of various sized pebbles. In a sanctuary famed for its innovative architecture built of imported marble, our current investigation emphasizes the fundamental role of local stone as a major component in the process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The central valley of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, accessed via the Eastern Hill's sacred way, has at its ritual focus the Hall of Choral Dancers and to its south, the monumental Hieron. Yet, the enigmatic structure immediately west of the Hieron known as the Altar Court plays an equally important role as the kinesthetic and architectural fulcrum between the central sanctuary and the monuments and terraces of the Western Hill. While architectural proportions and ornamentation link the Altar Court to the Hieron, its colonnaded and inscribed facade emphasizes its westward orientation, as it looks toward the theater, thereby infusing the space between the two edifices with both ritual and theatrical connotations.  Today, as in the past, the sanctuary's central ravine dramatically bisects this interstitial space, the deep channel sharply separating the central valley from the Western Hill throughout the sanctuary and hindering movement between the two areas. Excavation and study of the ravine's ancient remains have clarified the formal qualities of this monumental project, and the high material costs likely associated with its original construction phase and major renovation during the Roman period. The question of how this feature was bridged, and thus controlled movement between different areas of the sanctuary, is especially important in the area between the Altar Court and theater. Rather than a hindrance, the central ravine's mediation of movement played a crucial role in shaping experience and emphasizing key architectonic relationships.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Searching for the head of the Winged Victory in 1891, Charles Champoiseau first exposed the theater that ascends the western slope connecting the central sanctuary to the stoa plateau within the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. Several rows of well-preserved seats, the diazoma, and other features were uncovered by a French-Czech team in 1923, but when Karl Lehmann arrived at the site in 1937, evidence of the theater had largely vanished. Relying on other evidence, Lehmann arrived at a reconstruction that became the basis upon which scholars have understood the theater and its place within the larger sanctuary.  Recent research and excavation, however, has allowed us to clarify our understanding of the monument: georeferencing and correcting inaccuracies in the original French-Czech plan, determining the major design features of the theater, and gaining a better understanding of the complex topographic relationship of the buildings that define this critical zone of the Sanctuary. The koilon may have consisted only of the central five kerkides that survive, for a wedge-shaped design similar to the nearby theater at Thasos, but a fuller design should not be excluded. The newly secured position and dimensions of the orchestra, meanwhile, help to resolve the dual elevation issue in the space between the Altar Court and theater, and provide new evidence for how the Nike monument above the theater was oriented to meaningfully interact with the theater and the areas of the central sanctuary below.  Unfortunately, excavations have not clarified the date of the theater. Reconsideration of the orientation, function, and date of adjacent monuments provides relative evidence to suggest that the creation of a permanent stone theater may belong closer to the middle of the third century B.C.E, rather than the traditional dating at the end of the third or the early second century B.C.E.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper addresses two important aspects of the Nike Monument currently under investigation: the design of the ram that formed the end of the Nike's prow, and the curious remnants of plaster lion heads found scattered in and around the monument. Photogrammetry and 3D modeling have allowed us to work most effectively with the full surviving material split between Samothrace Archaeological Museum and the Musée du Louvre.  First, we have been able to reconstruct the ram that adorned the warship forming the base of the Nike monument. This daringly configured block originally was cantilevered from the socle to project nearly three meters. Unsurprisingly, it fractured near the midpoint, and only small fragments of it survive. Using photogrammetic 3D modeling of fragments on Samothrace and in the Louvre, we demonstrate that the Nike's ram is closely related to Egadi ram 1, relic of the first Carthaginian War, as well as a well-preserved Lartian marble ram, from a similar naval monument erected in Rhodes. Our new reconstructed 3D model of the prow demonstrates both the remarkable engineering required to construct the cantilevered block as well as the visual force of the projecting ram in this iconic monument.  Second, we use photogrammetric modeling to create a complete 3D set of scattered fragments of large-scale plaster lion heads from the Nike precinct. Never systematically studied, these humble fragments offer critical new evidence about the precinct. The remains indicate at least two, possible three lions head, possibly belonging to waterspouts on a sima. If correct, this would provide strong evidence that the Nike stood within a roofed structure. We present evidence for the profile of the block to which the lion heads were originally attached and discuss the unusual scale of the lions' heads for the likely size of the Nike's building.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Nike of Samothrace is considered one of the most important sculptural creations of the Hellenistic period and has received extensive scholarly attention. Nevertheless, most of the monument's publications focus on its sculptural style/features to extrapolate mainly on the issues of the identity of the dedicator, the sculptor of the statue, as well as the occasion for which it was erected. Dates proposed thus far for the monument range greatly, from the early third century to the first century B.C.E. However, the widely accepted placement of the statue in the period of the so-called Hellenistic baroque seems to narrow its date to about 250–150 B.C.E. Pottery, an important component of almost any archaeological problem, has not been taken into consideration so far. This paper argues that the pottery discovered in association with the Nike monument sheds light on the puzzling issue of its date, supporting or weakening some of the proposed theories.  This paper presents the pottery discovered in 1939 and in the 1950s and 1980s within the Nike precinct and its immediate surrounds. Certain caveats emerge: what kind of pottery should be expected for such a kind of monument? How much of this pottery material originally belonged to the area of the precinct? These concerns, combined with the fact that most pottery derives from disturbed fills, call for caution. Nevertheless, a rather uniform picture emerges: the pottery assemblage is dominated by the locally produced Samothracian conical bowls and small bowls, predominantly of the later variety with a string-cut base. Other shapes found in abundance include cooking ware, jugs, and transport amphorae. Consequently, this presentation argues that the date of the Nike monument in the late third to early second century B.C.E., initially proposed by Karl Lehmann, is not supported by the current analysis of the pottery from the Nike precinct.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The largest building in the Sanctuary, the stoa has been conspicuous since the first excavations at the site but has never been fully published. This paper presents the results of new research into the stoa's architecture, decoration, and use—helped especially by the identification of the corner geison block in the Louvre. Identifying the position of every block in the building's south wall, for instance, has revealed subtle design features, such as an intentional, uniform slope along the building's length. Was this a utilitarian addition to drain water from the stoa's terrace or an aesthetic refinement? The terra-cotta roof system indicates local craftsmanship but shares stylistic links with Hellenistic palaces, suggesting that the stoa's designers may have had palatial ambitions. Finds from the stoa, especially metal objects including iron, lead, and bronze fragments of construction materials, architectural embellishments, vessel parts, votive offerings, and jewelry, offer rich evidence for the building's ornamentation and the types of objects used within the building, as well as a glimpse of the many ancient visitors to the site. Capacity estimates for the building and adjacent theater reveal that the two structures functioned in tandem and could host crowds on a different scale than the intimate gathering places used for initiation into the Samothracian mysteries. These new avenues of investigation allow us to propose that the stoa was likely a local initiative financed by the Samothracian community. Its departures from the architectural conventions of the Sanctuary's ornate marble dedications shows how a city harnessed local crafts to meet international ambitions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The massive terrace built to support the Stoa became a highly desirable location for sculptural dedications in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. The surviving foundations of at least seven monumental statue platforms attest to the accumulation of grand dedications lining the stoa's facade. The remains of some are well preserved although no longer in situ; the appearance of several others above their foundations has long remained enigmatic. This paper presents the results of recent research into the monumental dedications on the stoa terrace. Through new field research, we can now attribute many fragments to particular foundations, enabling a clearer reconstruction of the dedicatory landscape of the stoa terrace. In a particularly exciting discovery, we have identified fragments of an Ionic column from the area that indicate an impressive column monument adjacent to the already known column monument of Philip V. In addition, a newly identified cutting on the Philip V base has furthered our understanding of the dedication's form, and the marble analysis of statue base fragments has revealed a wide range of imported marbles deployed in a variety of combinations on the stoa terrace. After analyzing the reciprocal relationship among sculptural dedications and the stoa, we show how the configuration of monuments determined visitors' access to the stoa in antiquity. We argue that dedicators strategically placed monuments in front of the stoa to create major entrance points and to vie for physical prominence and maximum visibility. Ultimately, we argue, these monuments converted the open terrace into a pathway that simultaneously prescribed entrance to the stoa and propelled visitors toward expansive vistas overlooking the Aegean Sea and central Sanctuary, encouraging visitors to recall their maritime approach to the island and to mentally reenact their recent physical and emotional journey through initiation into the mysteries of the Great Gods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many research libraries and museums hold unique or rare items on which historically significant text is no longer legible due to damage, deterioration, or erasure. Spectral imaging { the process of capturing images of objects in many colors or wavelengths of light, including parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not observable by humans but easily imaged by modern sensors (i.e., ultraviolet and infrared) { has become the go-to" solution for recovering obscured and illegible texts. Unfortunately, most of these imaging systems are very expensive and not intuitive to use. Additionally, software to process the captured images can be expensive, difficult to use, and require significant knowledge of image processing methods. To address the above issues, we have developed a low-cost multispectral imaging system with accompanying open-source software that librarians, curators, and scholars with limited budgets can use to recover obscured and illegible text in their collections. The developed system is easy to use, can be dismantled and transported with little effort, and produce good quality spectral images as well as accurate true color renderings for digitization if needed. The software was developed with simplicity and functionality in mind. Basic image processing to uncover lost text is easy to implement without special image processing knowledge. The system specifications, characterization and calibration procedures and results are discussed. Images captured from a 15th century palimpsested manuscript leaf are shown and results discussed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a previous article on theories of the sounding voice in China, I argued that it is only at specific historical moments, in certain kinds of discourse, and for certain kinds of purposes that the human voice is disentangled from a matrix of undifferentiated sound, often by likening the voice to other musical instruments and valorizing it above them.  In this talk, I will discuss how the rise of Kun opera (kunqu) in the sixteenth century is another such moment, when the singing voice is explicitly theorized and championed as part of a new art form emphasizing vocal virtuosity and connoisseurship within the entertainment world. To analyze the aesthetic categories and performative context of this musical discourse, I will concentrate on the writings of two key figures: Precepts of the Aria (Qulü), attributed to Wei Liangfu, the shadowy "forefather" of the Kun operatic style, and the personal essays of Pan Zhiheng (1556-1622), who earned the moniker "Venerable Chronicler of Courtesans." Pan is the most outspoken late Ming proponent for the preeminence of the human voice, for exalting an ideal of the voice (both in the most abstract and concrete ways), as something exceeding the words, something even exceeding the music, something even beyond the fusion of text and music. In the final part I will consider the larger implications of conceptualizing the voice as "flesh," both in terms of late Ming claims for the power of qing (love, desire) and anthropologist Tim Ingold's suggestion that we think of "the body ensounded" rather than "sound as embodied."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper was presented at the 2022 Mid Atlantic Archaeology Conference.  In 2019, the Montpelier Archaeology Department began excavations at the Overseer's House. The site is located just a short walk from the Montpelier Visitor Center, next to Mount Pleasant, the original Montpelier homestead, and near the Madison family cemetery. The study is part of a larger effort to understand the main agricultural complex at Montpelier, called the Home Farm, which encapsulates a 70 acre area made up of the overseer's house, a row of domestic quarters for people enslaved by the Madisons, a tobacco and wheat barn, and industrial sites such as a blacksmith shop.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>No one knows law's violence like those on its receiving end, yet imprisoned people have typically served merely as objects of socio-legal study. This paper argues for adoption of broad-scale, first-person prison witness as the primary map for a transformative justice seated in prison-born clarifications of what constitutes the human. U.S. prisons are de facto extra-legal spaces, nearly immune to legal rules or accountability. Those who witness penal practice know just how ineffective legal remedies are in penetrating prison walls. They are thus singularly situated to chart extra-legal paths to fully humane conceptions of justice as evidenced by first-person testimony from U.S. prisons and other carceral sites. In their essay on transformative justice, Paul Gready and Simon Robins write, "A transformative approach will need to be context dependent, driven by the local and particular understandings of rights in any context and consider the diversity of understandings that might exist. It will challenge a purely normative approach with a base of evidence" (Gready and Robins 2014, 344).  The primary base of evidence for this paper is The American Prison Writing Archive, a digital archive of (to date) 2,776 essays authored by 1,075 currently and formerly incarcerated people writing about their experience inside.  The paper argues that written resistance to carceral quarantine and censorship, in clarifying the minimum-without-which discursive status falls short of the fully human, sets the grounds for transformation of our notions of multiple forms of justice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The American Prison Writing Archive (APWA) is a fully-searchable digital platform for non-fiction essays by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside.  The Archive seeks to disaggregate this population into singular minds and ideas; at the same time, among the 3,054 posted essays, broad patterns that bind today's prison writing into a national witness literature are apparent. Narratives of the human costs of incarceration help counter the ‘big data' approach to carceral statehood with an unfolding of big narrative witness. In the APWA, academic commitment to both professional scholarship and public activism can join in a project that removes scholars from the roles of leading voices and into the work of secondary witnesses facilitating the labor of the organic intellects now burgeoning at the receiving end of law's violence and offering discursive resistance to carceral state censorship.  This capacity will be put into (preliminary) practice in real time among audience members.   The paper will begin with a five-minute PowerPoint history of the analog inception and into-digital growth of the APWA. It will then lead the audience through the basic search facets of the Archive. After a few minutes given to reading among these essays, the session will enter open discussion of what readers have found; stepping off from this discussion, the presenter will conclude by suggesting ways we might help prison witnesses in taking a vanguard position in resistance to the carceral state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rhizomes of Mexican American Art Since 1848 is an online digital tool that addresses the problem of discoverability caused by Eurocentric cataloging and vocabularies and historical erasure due to racism, sexism, and Western notions of art. Informed by intersectionality and decolonial theory, as proposed by Latina, Black, and Indigenous feminist scholarship, Rhizomes uses a broad notion of "art" in order to reach across humanities disciplines, types of institutions, time periods, and modes of creativity, as well as an inclusive notion of "Mexican America" that does not rely on citizenship. Conceived and designed in stages, Rhizomes will eventually assist under-resourced institutions with the digitization of artwork and provide a toolkit for light weight, low-tech online sharing, thereby linking libraries, archives, and museums with relevant materials and enhancing the discovery of Mexican American art. In the first iteration, Rhizomes harvests artworks and related documentation from large, national and midsized regional aggregators, such as the Digital Public Library of America and Calisphere, respectively. However, the first iteration of Rhizomes may not achieve its decolonial and intersectional goals. Although this post-custodial portal avoids the extractive methods of colonial collectors, code requires specificity and precision that limits the application of intersectional and decolonial frameworks. The presentation explores the complex decisions made in the building of Rhizomes that may not resolve the Eurocentricity of the existing aggregators, including the authority of Dublin Core and its erasure of intersectionality. Finally, it asks if the desire for sustainable, low-cost software is incompatible with intersectional and decolonial frameworks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historically, the formal cataloging of film production and the acquisition of moving-image archives has reflected the Anglo, heteronormative, patriarchal culture of the film industry with an emphasis on works financed by robust Western production cultures. The result has been the marginalization of films/filmmakers outside these criteria, which in turn keeps scholars unaware of vital collection holdings and production data. This roundtable brings together representatives from moving-image catalogs and archives to discuss efforts in systematically altering the way collections are organized, accessed, and acquired. The AFI Catalog "Women They Talk About" project repurposes the database's uniquely comprehensive, academic assets to support unprecedented empirical research about the role of gender throughout the American film industry. The Academy Film Archive's Cultural Equity and Inclusion Project, headed by the Cataloging and Public Access departments, is conducting an investigation of the Archive's holdings as related to underrepresented communities to better serve the needs of Academy staff and researchers. At UCLA Film &amp;amp; Television Archive ongoing efforts between Cataloging and Outreach departments to design staff-curated webpages, collection profiles, inventory lists and public programs connecting patrons with diverse collection materials. The Media Ecology Project is developing NEH-funded collaborations with professional catalogers and critical race studies scholars to augment vocabularies and keywords that identify and describe archival civil rights newsfilm.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This panel will review the work of a project responsive to the status of DV, called DVRescue. DV videotape formats face an exceptional obsolescence risk. Falling in-between professional expertise in file-based digital preservation and analog videotape digitization, DV tape are best preserved by migrating the data from the tape into a file rather than handling them as a video digitization event. A collaboration from MIPoPS and RiceCapades, the DVRescue project is funded by the NEH in order to research DV preservation and to create new tools to facilitate the efficient transfer of data from tape to file. The presenters will show early models of their work, research conclusions, and methods to troubleshoot DV capture and preservation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The East Kentucky Food &amp;amp; Dance Trail, a collaboration between Hindman Settlement School and the Appalachian Food Summit, highlights the area's venues that encourage community building, cross-generational learning, and entrepreneurship through our culinary and dance traditions. The Trail promotes regional relationship building, as well as cultural education and tourism opportunities for residents and visitors in east Kentucky. Hindman Settlement School started the Food &amp;amp; Dance Trail conversation over a year and a half ago and these conversations have resulted in twenty-five affiliates from farmer's markets, to restaurants, community centers, nonprofits, and others; and we feel like we're only just getting started. In January 2017 we brought on Appalachian Transition Fellow, Abby Huggins to help coordinate the project. The Food &amp;amp; Dance Trail is grounded in diverse stories, seeing food and dance as both things that gather people together. This interactive workshop will give a brief overview of the Food &amp;amp; Dance Trail while also creating space for story circles, oral history sharing, and a square dance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mission Statement of the Color Film Emergency Project (excerpt)  • This project emerged from the realization that numerous, valuable 35mm slide collections created and amassed by 20th century scholars, preservationists, design practitioners and photographers of the built environment are threatened with loss, destruction, and environmental damage. Some of the factors threatening these collections are the obsolescence of the medium for teaching; the advancing age, and retirement, of the creators; and lack of appropriate archival storage. The SAH,  through the Color Film Emergency Project, recognizes the importance of this part of 20th century intellectual history and documentation, and aims to facilitate its preservation, digitization, and access. With NEH funding, staff at UC Riverside and UC Santa Barbara are collaborating to achieve the following two foundational goals: 1. Identification and evaluation of at-risk 35mm slide collections of SAH members. 2. Development of a consortium of institutional partners to improve preservation goals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1952, Toy Len Goon was selected as U.S. Mother of the Year.  She was brought to Washington D.C. to be introduced to Congress and meet with Bess Truman and Ambassador Koo of Taiwan.  Having emigrated to the U.S. to join her husband at the age of 29, she raised eight children while running a hand laundry after her husband died.  She was publicly lauded for raising "good American citizens" without the aid of a husband and while refusing welfare.  But she was also chosen because she was a Chinese American woman who could exemplify the virtues of mothering and of American upward mobility. As the U.S. endeavored to extend influence in Asia, her D.C. visit had been orchestrated by Maine Rep. Robert Hale, in what the media termed "a blow in the Cold War for Asia" (Yeh 2012). While the WW II period marked a distinct shift in the portrayal of Chinese American women and family, the 1950s Cold War period also saw a broader focus on women and mothers as preservers of domesticity and the nuclear family in the U.S., in contrast to their counterparts in the Soviet Union who were suffering under Communist rule. This focus was accompanied by increasing recognition that this domestic life was not always possible or desirable, particularly for women of color. As newspaper coverage of her selection as Mother of the Year illustrated, Toy Len Goon was celebrated as a model mother, but there was disagreement on whether this was because she fulfilled traditional roles of domesticity, or because she was breaking out of that role by running a business to support her family. The fact that her life story could be interpreted in various ways to support specific ideas of family and women's roles was in part because she in fact occupied the roles of both homemaker and business owner. As I discuss in this paper, interviews with her children reveal the double burden she was forced to take on, providing a perspective that complicates celebratory views of her roles in the home.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The interview has long been a documentary staple, used by filmmakers to convey a range of information, from factual details to the emotional state of the person questioned. This paper examines how contemporary sub-Saharan African documentarists have used interviews to shape their films, producing critical visual analyses of African pasts and present-day realities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 1906 and 1960, colonial French filmmakers represented Africa and Africans in a seemingly endless flood of uninformed and racist travelogues, expedition narratives, and ethnographic films, images that were captured and extracted for consumption in the metropole. Moreover, given the barriers imposed by the cost of equipment and training and, after 1934, the notorious Laval Decree, Africans were prohibited from filming on their own continent. If only colonial images remain, what should we do with them? A model of restitution based on physical objects does not work for moving images, yet, drawing on my research on both colonial European and postcolonial African cinemas, I will argue that it is just as crucial to return them. Giving them back, differently from objects, does not mean giving them up, since the technology exists to produce high-quality digital copies. It does mean, however, foregoing both income from licensing fees and control over how the images are used. Despite the call for "digital sharing" of colonial photographs and films in Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy's 2018 report on restitution to French President Emmanuel Macron, no such project is underway with respect to collections either at the public Centre National du cinéma et de l'image animée or the private Gaumont Pathé Archives.Without formal restitution, France prevents Africans from owning moving images of their history, thus retaining control of our filmic understanding of the colonial period and its consequences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund is the largest and oldest Black-led cooperative organization that focuses on preventing Black land loss and building cooperatively-owned businesses. For over fifty years, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund has provided education and technical assistance to thousands of rural farmers across the South.   The Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund (FSC/LAF) and Emergency Land Fund (ELF) are two records collections being processed at the Amistad Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. The project is supported by an NEH grant to fund a processing project that spans over three years.  These records represent some of the largest sets of organizational records documenting the Southern cooperative movement and Black land ownership. The FSC/LAF was founded in 1967 by twenty-two rural cooperatives and credit unions in the South, while ELF was formed five years later following a study, entitled, Only Six Million Acres: The Decline of Black-Owned Land in the Rural South, by economist Robert S. Browne. This paper highlights the history of Black agricultural cooperatives and the role of the FSC/LAF and ELF to address the systemic decline in land ownership by African Americans through the extensive documentation provided in these two historic records collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Virtue and vice involve modes of character-based necessity and impossibility in ways that do not diminish responsibility or voluntariness. To a large extent, aspiring to virtue involves striving to acquire cognitive and motivational dispositions by which certain ways of acting become practically necessary. Vices can practically disable an agent for acting well on account of motivational and cognitive dispositions shaping necessities and impossibilities (even though the vicious agent does not strive to be disabled for right action). The explication of character-based necessity shows how practical necessity and impossibility can become durable, significant features of character as a result of voluntary activity even if the acquisition of those features was not intended. This is especially important because of the ways that virtues are related to each other, and because of how vices are related to each other. The discussion considers whether and why virtues are integrated and whether there is corresponding mutual reinforcement among vices.</Abstract>

Both locations shaped the lives of important African American professionals and activists whose civic engagement changed the landscape of American civil rights.  The former, Baltimore's premier historic African American community, gave these men and women their birthplace.  The second, America's oldest and first degree granting HBCU, enriched them with a college education.  Four Lincoln University student-scholars will document the significance of place in the lives of 15 Blatimore bred, Lincoln-educated University alumni by sharing the results of independent research into the lives and contributions of these outstanding individuals, who include Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Mitchell, Furman Templeton, William E.

		<Abstract>Collaborations between college courses and museums provide powerful learning experiences that take students out of the classroom and into the material culture of the past. This session presents on an immersive place-based teaching collaboration in which a community college literature class was taught entirely on site at two local museums.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The aim of this presentation is to convey the power of college-museum collaborations to transform the learning experience by taking students out of the classroom and into the material culture of the past. Capital Community College implemented a Place-Based Education initiative in 2011 with the help of the National Endowment for the Humanities that seeks to make Hartford an extension of the college campus by integrating museums, theatre, community centers, and other local resources into the curriculum of a variety of courses. The initiative, called the Hartford Heritage Project, has enabled strong collaborations between the college and local museums, which eventually spawned a unique, fully place-based literature course taught in the fall of 2015. English 220 Studies in American Literature—Stowe and Twain was taught entirely on site at the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center and the Mark Twain House &amp;amp; Museum. Students experienced in-depth and behind-the-scenes explorations of the houses of Stowe and Twain, current exhibits, and the libraries and archives of both museums. Planning and implementing the course required a close collaboration between staff members of both museums and the course instructor and presented challenges in scheduling, course content, approaches to literature and history, and assignment design. The presenters for this session will be the three principal members of the collaboration – the Program Coordinator of the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center, the Education Director of the Mark Twain House &amp;amp; Museum, and the English Professor from Capital Community College.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Representatives from the most commonly taught languages (Spanish, French, Russian, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic) in United States institutions of higher education address the results of the MLA survey of language enrollments in fall 2013. Presenters consider enrollments on their home campuses in the light of national trends and discuss how data from the survey can be used to advocate language study.A public discussion guided by these questions: &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 1. Did national trends in 2013 reflect the situation on your campus? If your numbers contradicted the national trend in 2013, how do you explain this? How are your local numbers in fall 2015? &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 2. What are programs that show no drop in enrollments doing that could be shared with colleagues? &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 3. Is the difference between introductory and advanced enrollments on your campus and/or in your field noteworthy?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 4. What do the numbers in graduate enrollments reveal about trends in graduate study on your campus and/or in your language?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 5. Are there long term trends in your specific language area that are important to recognize?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; 6. How can data from the MLA survey be used to advocate for our field?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article deals with language and music in two quite different languages and music cultures: that of the Kammu people in Laos and that of two Athabascan groups in Alaska. It has come out of a research project concerned with the study of vocal expressions in the borderland between speech and song, which spans over several language and music settings in societies where oral transmission of culture dominates. The aim of the project is to increase knowledge through collaboration between researchers with different approaches, to develop an interdisciplinary method for analysis of such expressions and to use this method in an intercultural study including several language and music settings. A long-term aim is also to play a part in the revitalization of such oral traditions and to contribute to their sustainability.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session brings together a group of experts for a conversation about new possibilities for digital research related to colonial and nineteenth-century Latin America. Hannah Alpert-Abrams of the University of Texas at Austin will speak on Ocular, an optical character recognition (OCR) tool that can read multilingual texts, including those involving indigenous languages. Nick Laiacona, founder of Performant Software Solutions, will discuss Juxta, a TEI-XML-based editing tool that provides an easy-to-use graphical interface and features for project management, including version control. Liz Grumbach, project manager for the Advanced Research Consortium and 18thConnect, will share her experiences creating communities to support the peer-review of electronic scholarship. Ralph Bauer of the University of Maryland will discuss the changes that are taking place at the Early Americas Digital Archive. This session has been designed as the starting point for what we hope will be an ongoing conversation about the Digital Humanities in our field.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the most popular and long-lived approaches to naturalizing the mind is the attempt to reduce mental phenomena to physical, biological, or neural phenomena. Reductionism has held a special allure among philosophers for a number of reasons: the intuitive appeal of part-whole explanations, reductive explanation's resemblance to the axiomatic method in mathematics, its apparent promise as a strategy for unifying different knowledge domains, and the fact that true reductions, when successful, are almost unique in yielding both metaphysical necessity and complete explanations. Reductionism was a very influential view in philosophy of science, both in early modernity and through much of the twentieth century, and some central contemporary issues in philosophy of mind -- the explanatory gap and the hard problem of consciousness -- are framed as claims that conscious mental states (and perhaps they alone) are not reducible to physical phenomena. In fact, however, most philosophers of science today would agree that true intertheoretic reductions are rare even in the natural sciences. I propose an explanation of both the appeal and the failure of reductionism in terms of a cognitivist approach to philosophy of science called Cognitive Pluralism, and then explore what implications post-reductionist philosophy of science has for philosophy of mind. If it is "explanatory gaps all the way down," what are the implications for dualism and for reductive, non-reductive and eliminative physicalisms? Is the mind-matter gap different than other explanatory gaps? And, if the Cognitive Pluralist analysis is correct, is there any hope more generally for a unified science, or that scientific theories generally can provide answers to metaphysical questions?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the twentieth century evolution of the expression of racial inequality through the prism of Joe Louis' experience as both a boxer and an icon. The study of sports in the United States offers a particularly effective mechanism for challenging the Whiggish assertion that race relations have been inexorably improving, with sports purportedly offering incontrovertible evidence of that trend. Americans' desperate yearning to sound the death-knell of racial strife can be seen in the popularity of films such as Remember the Titans (2000) that depict sports as the altar on which racism has died.&amp;#x0D; Joe Louis' story exposes the fallacy of this contention. Despite Louis' unprecedented popularity among whites, that fact never contravened pervasive assumptions about black inferiority.  The interdictions on Louis' behavior, the stereotyped portrayals of him during his reign as champion, and the modern-day appropriations of his image expose a persistent unwillingness to view Louis, or other black people, as full-fledged equals.  As contemporary Americans continue to identify sports as evidence of the U.S.'s racial egalitarianism, Louis' story suggests that this claim warrants reconsideration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the more controversial doctrines in the Dvaita or ‘dualist' system of Vedanta thought is the belief that souls in the state of mok?a experience hierarchical degrees of bliss. This concept of moksataratamya was first articulated by the Dvaita movement's 13th-century founder, Madhva. In keeping with his realist epistemology and pluralistic ontology, Madhva maintained that souls possess innate capacities or ‘yogyatas' that predestine them to achieve not only specific but stratified soteriological ends. It is perhaps unsurprising that modern critics have objected that this doctrine potentially lends eternal validity to conservative Hindu social hierarchies, which often restricted access to moksa to male elites. But traditional critics also pointed out the doctrine's inherent unfairness, particularly its problematic implication of God's partiality. In the final chapter of his polemical text, the Nyayam?ta or Nectar of Logic, the sixteenth-century Dvaita polemicist Vyasatirtha defends this doctrine of moksataratamya largely by flipping the issue of fairness on its head. As part of a larger doxographic project, Vyasatirtha surveys a variety of ideas within Hinduism about how to achieve liberation from samsara. These ideas range from Vedanta prerequisites of Vedic study to Puranic traditions about achieving mok?a through hatred of God (i.e., "dvesabhakti") to popular notions of achieving moksa merely by dying in a holy city. Vyasatirtha argues that the relative difficulty of these various sadhanas (or "means to mok?a") necessitates hierarchy within mok?a. After all, it is only fair that those who have used a more challenging method should be rewarded with a better form of mok?a than those who took an easier, or, a less wholesome route.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Smith argues that resentment has a crucial role in sustaining the determination to see that justice is done. He says, "It is the safeguard of justice and the security of innocence." No doubt, there are ways in which resentment can become toxic and morally problematic. Indeed, many thinkers urge the minimization of resentment because of how corrupting it can easily become or how corrupting it is alleged to be in its own right. Smith's view of resentment suggests an epistemic role and a motivational role for it. Resentment can be an appropriate expression of denunciation of the wrong done, reflecting a correct perception of it, and it can sustain the commitment to see that justice is served. Is Smith correct that the moral psychology of resentment has an important role in regard to criminal justice? How are we to understand resentment in the larger context of Smith's views about sympathy, imagination, and sociability? Is there tension between resentment's role vis a vis criminal justice and a liberal polity's concern to sustain an open, tolerant, pluralistic civil society?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the oft-told story of Joe Louis's 1938 boxing match against the German fighter, Max Schmeling, the black Detroiter emerged as an American hero hailed by whites and blacks alike for his symbolic democratic victory over Nazism.  Others before me have certainly noted the incongruity of Louis being employed as a symbol of American democracy when he, as a black man, suffered the injustices of Jim Crow inequality.  In this paper, however, I argue that the common embrace of Louis as the nation's standard-bearer in fact reinforced the racial schism evident in America.  &amp;#x0D; In an ironic twist, Louis's fight against Schmeling provided white Americans with the ammunition with which they could claim U.S. superiority over fascism while permitting them to not actually improve conditions for black Americans.  By hailing Louis as a hero, whites could lay claim to a racial liberalism that did not genuinely exist.  But in their assertion of egalitarianism, "proven" by their acceptance of a black man as a hero, whites could avoid confronting the reality of racial injustice in America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In her paper on memory and nostalgia, Sacks explores the appropriation of heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis' image by both blacks and whites. Both groups sought to exploit him in the promotion of their own racial fantasies.  Hailed as a hero by whites and blacks alike, Sacks argues that the physical representation of him both in his boxing heyday and in contemporary times reflects the deep racial divide plaguing the United States.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The late 1930s offered a propitious moment for the arrival of a black heroic figure on the American scene.  With fascism on the rise in Europe and the world teetering on the brink of war, Americans' increasingly vociferous condemnation of the Nazis' racist creed smacked uncomfortably of hypocrisy.  Gradually, beginning with academics and social progressives, Americans began to reexamine their own system of beliefs about racial hierarchy and even to challenge the precepts underlying Jim Crow segregation.  &amp;#x0D; Anxious to affirm the preeminence of democracy, particularly in the face of anti-discrimination protest emerging from the black population in the form of A. Philip Randolph's March on Washington Movement and the black press's "Double V" campaign, a growing constituency of white Americans became receptive to symbolic representations of racial tolerance. Joe Louis became their vehicle for doing so.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the significance of the racially distinctive appropriations of Louis' image.  The deadpan expression for which Louis became known provoked wild speculation about the man himself.  More importantly, it allowed viewers to imprint their own interpretation of race onto the supposedly blank canvass of his face.  White people assuaged their fears about a black man pummeling white men into the ropes by shaping Louis into a known, stereotypical black boy/man: a chicken-eating, lazy simpleton.  They analyzed and unpacked his demeanor until they assured themselves that his blank face did not reflect anything sinister but instead, mindlessness.&amp;#x0D; Black people, on the other hand, celebrated Louis as an avenging messiah.  They claimed to recognize in his impassive countenance the strategy of black people since slavery to hide their true selves from whites.  Writers like Richard Wright and Langston Hughes insisted that Louis symbolized strength, power, resistance, and pride -- precisely those characteristics that so worried whites.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>La investigación de agravios a los indígenas de Pelileo en 1661 resultó en un documento detallado de testimonios sobre los abusos que ellos sufrieron en el obraje de San Ildefonso. En esta ponencia analizo estos testimonios con la intención de entender la situación de indígenas de dos posiciones sociales diferentes: los intermediarios indígenas, y los forasteros, quienes carecían de una red de parentesco en Pelileo. No solo considero las voces, sino también los "silencios" en el documento, el que no se provee conocimiento sobre los forasteros ni testimonios de los esclavos Africanos, quienes fueron actores importantes en los acontecimientos que tuvieron lugar en San Ildefonso reportados en 1661.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the significance of the racially distinctive appropriations of Louis' image, both historically and in contemporary times.  The deadpan expression for which Louis became known provoked wild speculation about the man himself.  Ultimately, disparate publics imprinted their own interpretation of race onto the supposedly blank canvass of his face.  While white people assuaged their fears about a black man pummeling white men into the ropes by shaping Louis into a known, stereotypical black boy/man, black people celebrated Louis as an avenging messiah.  They claimed to recognize in his impassive countenance the strategy of black people since slavery to hide their true selves from whites.  More recently, Joe Louis's name and image have been invoked in the construction of statues, the naming of sports venues (a hockey arena and a golf course), as the inspiration for an opera, and in explaining the significance of President Barack Obama's election victory in 2008.  As the United States continues to grapple with the pernicious question of race, Joe Louis's inscrutability offers a malleable template for making a wide array of claims about America's racial progressiveness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the difficulty of creating a national memory museum in Peru, as seen in the obstacles faced before the official opening of the Lugar de la Memoria, Tolerancia e Inclusión Social (LUM) in Lima. I  argue that the LUM's troubles in part stem from a more generalized insistence, in the country's official transitional justice efforts, on treating the internal conflict as a bracketable event, an interruption in the national historical continuum, as a trauma to be overcome and, even, as what pedagogues might call a teachable moment. The truth, a truth, of the past must be studied so that it not be repeated, as the omnipresent slogan reads. However, looking at the series of false starts or failures of the LUM, I ask if the greater truth might not lie in that very repetition, in the failures, if we insist on labeling them as failures, of the project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While scholars have intensively studied Yugoslavia's weaknesses and dissolution (both in the interwar and post-World War II eras) from political and economic perspectives, there has been less work on the issue of cultural cohesion so crucial to Yugoslavism (the Yugoslav idea) as it was conceived and developed in the nineteenth century and elaborated upon during World War I. In particular, there has been little attempt to interrogate the long-term (1918–today) discursive construction of Yugoslav identity by means of collective memory—that is, the selectively shared stories people tell about themselves in order to give meaning to the ‘nation,' a sense of belonging to the ‘national culture.' And yet from the moment Yugoslavia was created, ordinary Yugoslavists began constructing the Sarajevo assassination as a heroic narrative of opposition and liberation that transcended the particularist identities of ethnicity, nation, religion, and history. How did the different Yugoslav regimes and post-Yugoslav political elites respond to these efforts to shape a collective cultural memory around Gavrilo Princip's political murder of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire? What can the various manifestations of this memory and official attitudes towards it tell us about the Yugoslav national project writ large? These are the main themes addressed in my paper.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historian, regent of France, and patron of art and architecture, Abbot Suger of Saint-Denis was also a liturgist and liturgical commentator. He endowed feasts and memorials, and he described in his charters and historical writings the significance of liturgical ritual and liturgical objects. While most famous for his celebration of the visual aspects of the liturgy—bejeweled vessels, anagogical narratives in sculpture and stained glass, etc.—Suger also highlighted the role of the other senses in liturgical experience. This paper explores the significance of taste, food, and feasting (or not) in Suger's liturgical thought, in the abbey's liturgical records, and in the medieval liturgy and its commentary traditions more broadly. It also demonstrates the importance of charters and other kinds of writings in our efforts to reconstruct and understand the liturgies of the past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Art, Auctions, and Public Spectacle in Nineteenth-Century Paris&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; by Darius A. Spieth&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In nineteenth-century Paris, auctions emerged as a space for the public negotiation of both the value and the meaning of art, akin in their social dynamics to the official Salon. Although close to 20,000 art auction catalogs were published over the course of the century, few attempts have been made to systematically explore this treasure trove of facts and data, which is apt to reveal the inner workings of the "art market capital of nineteenth century." Part of a book-length study on art auctions in Paris during this time period, the paper will investigate in particular the fluctuations of art market volume from the Revolutionary period through the Third Republic, and contextualize this information with French macroeconomic data. The talk will describe the research methodology used to compile this information, and then correlate art market turnover with French GDP. The findings will be interpreted in light of both the political upheavals and financial crises that afflicted the era.  I will argue for the recognition of art auctions as key sites of Parisian modernity, because it was here that marketing strategies and protocols for valuing art, both economically and aesthetically, became entrenched that continue to define the rules for appreciating art today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Netherlandish Golden Age Art in Revolutionary Paris&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This talk describes the structures of the Parisian art market before, during, and after Robespierre's rule, using examples of prices realized for Netherlandish art at auction. Although the French art market went through a brutal period of contraction during the 1790s, exacerbated by a period of hyperinflation by the middle of the decade, art continued to be bought and sold. After adjustments for inflation, Netherlandish pictures, widely regarded as the least risky art investment at the turn of the nineteenth century, lost on average slightly more than half of their value in the decade after 1789. It was only in the 1830s that the value of Netherlandish art again attained the same level as during the ancien régime. Demand for art during the Revolutionary years came mostly from British dealers and the expanding French bourgeoisie, both of whom were bargain hunters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Tunisia, trance rituals animated by praise songs to Sufi saints are not exclusive to members of Sufi orders or participants in Sufi ceremonies. Rather, a number of distinct healing and devotional musical traditions co-exist, each associated with particular social and devotional communities. In this paper I bring together four such traditions, those of women, Jews, blacks, and hard-drinking laborers, to demonstrate how each of their musical practices serves as a musical, social, and devotional niche while contributing to a larger ecology of Sufi music that also includes the great variety of Sufi rituals as well as staged concerts. More specifically, while the musical "journey" (ri?la) through a chain (silsila) of praise songs is a metaphorical image and organizational scheme that is shared by each of these traditions, the nature of the journey and the different destinations along the way musically mark each one as distinctive and representative of the particular histories and devotional itineraries of each ritual community. This paper emphasizes the important role of women and minorities in cultivating Sufi aesthetics, and shows how Sufism resonates throughout Tunisian society via listening publics associated with numerous genres of music—both "sacred" and "secular"—that evoke the spiritual and therapeutic power of music and trance. Based on ethnographic research between 2009 and 2015, this presentation takes as its starting point the changing politico-religious climate after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 and the concomitant threats to the survival of musical practices associated with Muslim saints.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1974, residents of Tokyo were asked about their opinions on garbage.  A full 93 percent of the 973 survey respondents agreed to at least some degree that "there must be reflection about a consumer culture in which things that could still be used are thrown away as garbage."  And close to 89 percent responded similarly to the proposition that "the reuse of garbage must be advanced for the sake of conserving resources."   Both the question and the answers reflected the extent to which garbage had become, by the early 1970s, a site of interconnected conversations about disposability, consumerism, energy, resources, and environmental pollution.  This paper examines the various meanings that were imposed upon garbage in the wake of the Tokyo Garbage War and the Oil Shock by politicians, government ministries, the waste management industry, academics, and various citizens' groups.  And it explores the ways in which garbage was a site of mutually imbricated discourses about a throwaway culture, energy and resource shortages, environmental damage, and limits to economic growth in a period of mass production, mass consumption, and mass waste.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1976, Japanese readers were introduced to the children's book Momo: The Mysterious Story of the Time Thieves and the Girl who Brought the Stolen Time Back to the People.  Penned by Michael Ende and published in the original German only a few years earlier, the story of a young waif and her battle against insidious time thieves known as the "men in grey" enjoyed significant and enduring popularity with a broad and diverse Japanese audience from the late 1970s through the present day.  Through its concern with time, the book captured the attention of harried Japanese readers who embraced this opportunity to consider questions about what imbues time with meaning and what a truly rich life might be.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This paper examines reactions to Momo that were published in Japanese newspapers, magazines, and scholarly journals as a way to explore resistance to the fetishization of tropes about efficiency, speed, productivity, and utility, and the conception of affluence in purely financial terms.  Resonating with laments about busyness and the lack of meaningful time, Momo was often interpreted as an expression of profound disappointment with the unrealized life and aborted promises of economic growth, and as a reflection on the poverty of meaning in people's lives in an era of financial affluence and abundance.  Using Momo as a lens, the paper will delve into these rallying cries for defining a rich life not by quantifiable, monetary measures but in serious consideration of contentedness, happiness, and humaneness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How might an art historical education change the way a doctor analyzes an ultrasound? The way a mathematician looks at a graph? Or how a politician presents her campaign? Visual literacy and close looking can help students innovate in any field, yet few have access to this vital training. With assistance from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Plymouth State University, NH, is developing an Applied Visual Literacy Curriculum that will infuse visual analysis skills into at least three preprofessional fields: business, health, and environmental science. The traditional art history major courses—currently organized by historical period and geographic region—will be replaced with a suite of thematic, interdisciplinary courses, including The Business of Art History, Envisioning the Environment, and Bodies of Art. Professors from these areas will collaborate to develop the new classes, creating an authentic blend of the participating discourses. Partnering with popular majors resolves practical enrollment issues in art history, creating a model that can be emulated by other institutions facing similar demographic challenges. More important, this curriculum brings together advanced students from across the university to engage in genuine, rigorous, and original inquiry that moves both of their disciplines forward.</Abstract>

This session provides an overview of the Certificate in Integrated Humanities Program at Doane, which offers students a career-focused pathway through their general education requirements. We will discuss the program itself, but also take participants through the planning and design process, calling attention to the obstacles we faced and the ways we were able to move past them. This work is supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The R.E.A.C.H. Initiative is a multi-year collaboration between the departments of Philosophy and Psychology at Salisbury University. The humanities are at the center of a needful rethinking of the purpose of undergraduate education at our institution, as well as the public mission of state-assisted universities. The R.E.A.C.H. Initiative brings together, via a slate of new curricular and co-curricular resources focused on Ethics, two major elements of institutional revision: (i) Curriculum change aimed at harmonizing professional training with early exposure to philosophical and research ethics, and (ii) Community-driven learning, where our immediate community has a say and a stake in the design of public-facing services, internships and programming.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Social justice goals can oftentimes conflict with organizational goals and priorities (Mease, 2016), and nonprofit organizations can sometimes struggle to fulfill social justice missions (Shaw &amp;amp; Allen, 2009). This talk will present research on how representatives of community organizations understand concepts pertaining to social justice. Seven representatives of community-based organizations (CBOs), which included faith organizations, nonprofits, and local government entities, participated in a virtual focus group to discuss concepts pertaining to organizational ethics. During the focus group, participants were asked: "What is the difference between equality and equity? How do these terms differ from fairness?" and "What is justice? What is the distinction between performative justice and transformative justice? How do we know when we are engaging in transformative justice?" Participants' conversations were video recorded and transcribed. Responses will be analyzed via thematic analysis (Braun &amp;amp; Clarke, 2008). The findings have implications for psychologists working with CBOs to promote organizational and community justice, as well as for organizations looking to develop mission statements and organizational values centered around social justice concepts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Community-centered ethical decision-making often fails to capture constituent feedback (Persad, 2017). In contrast, epistemic justice (Fricker, 2007) builds both critical social awareness (Congdon, 2017) and procedural justice (Tyler &amp;amp; Lind, 1988). To better understand community ethics, 23 people representing 17 community-based organizations participated in one of five focus groups. Focus groups lasted two-hours, and four to six participants each. All groups took place via Zoom, and were recorded. Participants discussed a series of questions, including "What comes to mind when you think of the word "ethics?" "What are the most important ethical values that guide your organization?" "Are the values of your organization ever in conflict with each other?" and "What values guide your leadership to act in the way they do and/or omit to do?" Responses were coded using thematic analysis (Braun &amp;amp; Clarke, 2006). The findings indicate participants saw ethics along a multi-dimensional framework which varied along who their organization is accountable to (social norms or the community), the ecological level (society, the organization, or personal ethics), and where priorities are placed. Further, several values associated with ethics were identified, including integrity, equity, power, assumptions that people behave morally, law, and teamwork, among others. These findings indicate both some overlap with White supremacy culture (Okun, n.d.) and departure from it. Findings will be discussed in the context of improving community ethics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The past decade has seen a surge of scholarship on art history pedagogy, revealing a high degree of innovation within the field. Educators have called for much-needed diversification, flipped the classroom, and weighed the relative merits of chronological versus thematic approaches. However, previous publications and presentations on this topic typically highlight experimentation at the level of individual assignments or specific courses. The present panel expands this discussion to encompass program-wide changes. How are art historians reimagining the curriculum of entire majors, minors, options, certificates, or general education tracks? This is an urgent question at a time when the arts and humanities occupy a precarious position in higher education. Art history programs are adapting in response to shifts in enrollments, institutional priorities, and student demand. Possible solutions may involve strategically consolidating offerings, cross-listing classes with other disciplines, rebranding the major, or creating new interdisciplinary or pre-professional degrees. By sharing examples of how programs have responded to their particular circumstances, others can forge sensible solutions for their own contexts. More than simply reacting to logistical problems in higher education, however, curricular revision provides a valuable opportunity to reconsider the epistemology of art history and its role in the twenty-first-century academy and economy.</Abstract>

Initial transcriptions and translations were done by college-age tribal members who had studied the language paired up with elders. We report on our experiences with the project and some of the results of that work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter draft explores a long-running desegregation caes in Los Angeles, Crawford v. Los Angeles United School District, a class action suit filed in California Superior Court in 1963 and that was effectively ended by an anti-busing ballot measure that passed in California in 1979. The ideal of integration had seemed, to civil rights advocates, both a logical aspiration and a plausible outcome when the Crawford suit and hundreds of others like it were initiated across the North and West in the early 1960s. Over the course of the 1970s, however, that ideal gradually fell apart. The progressive political goals that inspired powerful elected officials, civil rights lawyers, judges, and others to work toward the creation and enforcement of desegregation laws in the 1950s and 1960s were outmatched in the 1970s by the conjunction of conservatism and racism, which emerged with new energy as part of a nationwide backlash against court-ordered desegregation as it spread beyond the South. The growing popular resistance to civil rights enforcement was bolstered in turn by political messaging from across the legislative and executive branches.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our understanding of Vaupés multilingualism is sometimes clouded by reliance on outdated kinship theory in which pre-existing descent groups ‘own' reified ‘languages' that serve as ‘emblems' or ‘badges' to which people owe ‘loyalty'. An alternative is to view language as a kind of substance that is constitutive of the individuals and groups involved. But what kind of substance? To answer this question requires shifting attention from a diversity of languages to a diversity of -lects, including shamanic spells and flute music. This opens the way to examining the relation between speech, breath, semen and soul, and to viewing language, music and tobacco smoke as devices that give added substance to breath. In the Vaupés context, in its role as a substance constitutive of persons, language is something that is smeared on the body, trapped in the ears and eaten through the mouth.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since the 1970s, the Eastern Tukanoan groups living in Colombia and Brazil have been known for generalized multilingualism resulting from their practice of linguistic exogamy (Sorensen 1967; Jackson 1972, 1974, 1983; Hugh-Jones 1979). These groups are patrilineal, patrilocal and, we could say, ‘patrilingual'. In a nuclear family, husband and wife must belong to different patrilineal groups and, therefore, express their affiliation through the exclusive use of their father's language, in spite of the fact that children spend their childhood with women and learn their mother's language first. Several issues concerning the languages involved will be examined. The belief that the father's language is the expression of an individual's essence, reflected in the use of the verb ‘speak' to refer to the father's language but ‘imitate' for the other languages, including the mother's - as do the most traditional groups (Pira-parana river, Colombia). Intensive language contact between groups involved in preferential alliance relationships favors linguistic variation and linguistic acculturation - as in the Barasana and Edúuria case, with ‘languages' sharing the same grammar, differing mainly by their tonal system (Gomez-Imbert 1999). Or an extreme situation, observed in Brazil, where the father's identity language is abandoned in favor of the Tukano language. The marriage of lovers sharing patrilinearity and ‘patrilinguality' is forbidden, incestuous. But the issue is not as dramatic as in Shakespeare's drama: the couple chooses exile.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Traditionally, the Hupd'äh people of the Nadahup linguistic family, from the interfluvial region of the Papuri and Tiquié River, from the Uaupés river basin, even though their traditional territories are well demarcated, are closely related to their neighbors, people from the Tukano linguistic family, of the Northwest Amazon with which maintain a secular and a very specific model of exchanges, within a multilingual context that is very characteristic throughout this wide region. This presentation seeks to discourse ethnographic and sociolinguistic elements to broaden the debate on loans and the use of words that exactly reflect this peculiar model of exchanges, a characteristic that identifies them as peoples, at the same time distinct and similar, when seeking to understand more the linguistic and semantic ethnological context of words that are widely used in the Hupd'äh language. This presentation explores the notion of "Masaãi", from two narratives of the creation of two hupd'äh clans, the possibilities of understanding social and linguistic relations in this peculiar ethnographic context.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>First appearing in the 1530s, news maps were one of the earliest forms of visual reporting. Printed, often hastily, on single sheets of paper, these works portrayed current events in their geographical context. While a few are known depicting non-military events, the vast majority revolve around battles and sieges. This talk focuses on several of the earliest known examples, which were published in Rome and depict clashes between Ottoman and Habsburg forces in Austro-Hungary and the Mediterranean. From these modest origins the genre was soon to explode in popularity, becoming a key early form of the news. In these works, printmakers were responding to a growing demand for topical information from a public that wanted to know and make sense of recent events, to fit themselves into a larger narrative of unfolding history and place in the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Coptic Scriptorium project (https://copticscriptorium.org) uses interdisciplinary digital and computational methods to make richly annotated Coptic texts openly available online. In this paper, we present the project's latest work on linked open data for named entities in Coptic literature. Linked open data is a feature enabled by the open web, where publicly available data in one place (such as Coptic Scriptorium's website) links to stable information related to that data elsewhere on the public internet. Our recent work has focused on identifying named entities (people, places and more) mentioned in Coptic texts and linking them to other resources online. This paper presents the newest developments of our entity coverage, progress in "wikification" (linking to Wikipedia entries) for our Sahidic New Testament and Sahidic Old Testament data, and new applications and research directions for researchers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper explores early cinema professionalization through the transmedial career of Russian director Evgenii Bauer, who worked across different arts and practices including amusement gardens, theater scenography, and painting. Specifically, it tracks emancipation of film directing in Bauer's transition from the skills of stage designer to the crafts of film director as a profession, emerging circa the early 1910s. I argue that Bauer's role as a set designer, that included more than twenty years in the pictorial theater of operetta-féerie,and his techniques in the fabricated environment are crucial for shaping a new profession of film director. I further argue that the set design practice functioned simultaneously as a juncture of these two professions and a site of their separation. Considering Bauer's innovation in theater scenography – a reform of the stage wings that reveals a departure from the conception of space, offered by the post-Renaissance theater and dominated by the central axis – I survey how his architecture of the film set plays with materiality of various surfaces such as glass and gauze. I finally claim that Bauer's conception of the set as a designed milieu converged with the privileging of mood, while his techniques, especially the veil effect, became technologies of atmosphere and markers of the film director's craft.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the opening of Soviet archives, scholars have written many important works about the ghettos in German-occupied Eastern Europe. The Holocaust Ghettos Project is the first major effort to study the geography of ghettoization, both as a spatial process and as particular acts that transformed places and individuals' lives at different times, in different ways, across a vast region. Other papers in this and the following session will present work from the three branches of our project: a multi-part historical GIS of ghettos; textual analysis of a corpus of interviews with Holocaust survivors; and an historical, digital gazetteer of ghettos that will help us link survivor accounts to the GIS data. Our over-arching goal is to intersect and integrate the lived experience of the Nazis' victims with perpetrator actions through the places where the Holocaust was implemented.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay explores the discursive means by which ingrained trajectories of medical knowledge and practice have been re-envisioned and recalibrated in U.S. history. It takes for its case study the development of the field of fertility science and medicine, which is an outgrowth of Dr. J. Marion Sims's notorious, nineteenth-century gynecological tradition of invasive and injurious surgeries targeting the female body. More specifically, this essay offers a critical-comparative analysis of Sims's mid-to-late-nineteenth-century medical publications and Dr. Sophia Kleegman's mid-twentieth-century medical publications to highlight the differing pedagogies of sight at work therein. The analysis reveals that—in contrast to the objectivist, myopic, and exclusively female-focused visual pedagogy that Sims articulated—Kleegman's pedagogy provided disciplinary readers with a distinct, "conservative surgery" hermeneutic for scientific study and treatment that illuminated new diagnostic heuristics related to the proximity of pain, the scale of efficiency, and the boundaries of corporality and expertise. In this way, Kleegman's articles instantiated an alternative disciplinary optics that balanced past ways of seeing with emergent, ethically calibrated modes of clinical judgement. Ultimately, this technical intervention into medical vision facilitated the realization of increasingly humane and effective practices across reproductive medicine and fertility science beginning in the mid-to-late-twentieth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>MiniDV tapes are made to be tiny and cheap. These factors enabled many cultural, journalistic, and humanities organizations to create unique audiovisual documentation for the first time. This format, however, was not commonly used for media distribution, thus a collected DV tape is very likely a camera original or a unique recording rather than a copy. While cheap and tiny, DV tape is far more susceptible to contamination, damage, decay, and environmental factors than other videotape formats from the same time period and there are few resources or tools to support the migration of data fromDV tapes Due to abandonment by market forces, the major software options for migrating DV tape are all now unavailable. This poses a tremendous preservation risk, as DV contains a wealth of metadata (including validation checks) allowing the results of a data transfer to be easily assessed. If captured digitally, the DV videodeck leaves thorough documentation within the resulting DV file regarding the success and failure of its transfer.  Falling in between the substantial eras of analog video tape and digital audiovisual files, DV tape was a transitional format which has not been sufficiently addressed by research and development in audiovisual preservation. Whereas preservation communities bring substantial expertise on the digitization of analog videotape and on the preservation of digital files, there are few resources or tools to support the migration of data from the surfaces of DV tapes into digital files. DV Rescue, a NEH-funded project, is an attempt to address this need via research and tool development focused specifically towards rescuing the content of DV tapes.  The panelists, all participants in the DV Rescue project, will share findings, discuss the challenges and strategies of building software upon obsolete technology, and workflows to take advantage of the potential automation abilities of DV tape preservation. Panelists will seek to demystify the entire process</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Tim Berners-Lee introduced the concept of Semantic Web, where he suggested using the ideas of Open Data, semantically described resources and links, as well as usable (machine readable) interfaces and applications for creating a Giant Global Graph. In 2016 the FAIR principles were introduced [MW16]: Research data and its metadata have to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Linked Data is an essential part of the FAIR principles: "TheSemantic Web isn't just about putting data on the web. It is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. [TBL06]." Publishing research data as HTTP URIs with RDF content containing links to other resources makes data FAIR! On top of that, these data should be open for access, re-use and universal participation. A five star rating system of openness [MH12] was introduced to rate Linked Data, i.e. "Linked Open Data (LOD) is Linked Data which is released under an open licence. [TBL06]. " Furthermore, LOD have to be usable for scientists and programmers to take advantage of all the LOD power. Following the LOUD principles[RS18] will make LOD even more FAIR. Merging all these principles to create FAIR and LOUD research data results in the Sphere 7 Data Model, which enables a wide array of digital humanities and archaeological (web-)applications using LOUD and FAIR data. The Linked Data Cloud already offers research data repositories for certain archaeological and humanities domains. Popular examples of FAIR LOUD providers are: Nomisma.org Kerameikos.org, Pelagios, OpenContext, Portable Antiquities Scheme, ARIADNE and there are more to come. The development of more and more repositories poses challenges in handling the complex facets of data quality and completeness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2018, the classical archaeology-oriented Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) issued an "Addendum, Guidelines for the Evaluation of Digital Technology and Scholarship in Archaeology," recommending that departments should evolve their positions on the recognition of the intellectual effort involved in digital research and publication (3D/VR, databases, Geographic Information Systems, etc.) with respect to tenure and promotion, stating that a "digital product should be considered to be of the same value as a paper publication since it must undergo a rigorous vetting process just as its print counterpart (AIA 2018)." Similarly, earlier this year, the Society for American Archaeology published similar documentation for departments of archaeology and anthropology in the United States, extending beyond the scope of the AIA's proposal to include Public Archaeology as well (SAA 2019). These are the two most prominent archaeology membership organizations in the United States, and it is clear that computation methodologies in scholarship and dissemination are increasingly in the mainstream in archaeology as a whole, and no longer a niche within certain departments; digital tools are inseparable from analog ones in cataloging and analyzing information and publishing new knowledge. In order to remain apace of these changes, it is also incumbent upon digital publishers to alter their workflows so that the scholarly profile of an academic can be populated and each contributor recognized for his or her work. Indeed, this is particularly important for the frequently neglected student participants looking to strengthen their CVs and any junior faculty member seeking promotion and tenure. Kerameikos.org, an international, collaborative project to define the intellectual concepts of Archaic and Classical Greek pottery in accordance to theprinciples of Linked Open Data, has made recent progress in this area by formalizing contributions to the project through current standards.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The history of West Virginia newspapers provides a rich and valuable narrative of the state, from its war torn separation from Virginia, to its development as a state whose newspapers reported the rapid growth of industry; from coal mining to oil, lumber and glass, to the influx of immigrant and African American populations to work in these burgeoning fields of commerce.   This presentation will provide an overview of West Virginia University Libraries' digitization grant funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress to digitize the state's historic newspapers for the site, Chronicling America.  The presentation will include a history of the NDNPWV program, the selection process, work flow, vendors and partners, and a tutorial on using Chronicling America as well as an overview of newspaper content available on the site.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The importance of sharing sociolinguistic data has been the subject of workshops (LSA 2012, 2016), included in publications (Mallinson, 2013) and encouraged by funding agencies (NSF 2016). In line with these initiatives is the creation of student-based corpora of U.S. Spanish (e.g., Corpus of Mexican Spanish in Salinas, Spanish in Texas, Corpus de Español en el Sur de Arizona, Corpus Bilingüe del Valle), in which students take part in building sociolinguistic corpora. Student-based US Spanish corpora not only provide important data for variationist research including the opportunity to analyze changes in progress (Torres Cacoullos &amp;amp; Berry, forthcoming), but also provide students with training in sociolinguistic methods. This hands-on approach in turn raises sociolinguistic awareness among students, especially among minority language speakers whose native dialects are often seen as mixed hybrids. In this paper, we illustrate such a project by explaining step-by-step the involvement of students in the creation and maintenance of the Corpus del Español en el Sur de Arizona (CESA) and the Corpus Bilingüe del Valle (CoBiVa), the protocols followed to facilitate the sharing of data, and the development of technologically-aided transcription methods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this study, we describe the Corpus del Español en el Sur de Arizona (CESA) and the Corpus Bilingüe del Valle (CoBiVa) and compare technologically-aided transcription methods for corpora development. Currently, the corpora are involved in a research project analyzing and testing various technologically aided transcription methods. Research assistants and students in the internship classes are testing the speed and ease of use of auto-generated transcription using Microsoft Stream, voice recognition using SpeechNotes, and manual transcription with ExpressScribe. The presentation will describe the results from testing with regard to ease of use, speed, and accuracy. Preliminary results show that Stream may be best suited for monolingual data, while SpeechNotes may be best suited for bilingual data. The researchers hope that these findings will encourage further development of local community-based, community-driven corpora.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For this study, we first compared three distinct open source transcription methods: 1) a manual transcription program (ExpressScribe), 2) a real-time voice recognition software where the user can edit and switch between languages (SpeechNotes), and 3) a captioning software that generates a transcript with timestamps, but only in one language (Microsoft Stream). The researchers compared baseline transcripts from the two voice recognition software methods to a corrected version of the transcript for each audio file to derive measures of accuracy. Averaged together across interviews, there was an average accuracy rate of 26% for Audio from Speaker (SpeechNotes) and 65% for auto-generated (Stream), leading us to discard SpeechNotes as a viable option. In a follow up study during Spring 2021, 33 students participated in a sociolinguistic field methods course that focused on the development of sociolinguistic corpora at the two universities. Overall, students reported that 10 minutes of transcription took them approximately 3 hours and 24 minutes for the manual (ExpressScribe) and 2 hours for the auto-generated transcript revision (Stream). Students also widely preferred the auto-generated transcription method for its speed and ease of use. The results show that the captioning software (Microsoft Stream) performs the highest in terms of speed, accuracy, and ease of use. This project contributes to a growing trend in data sharing and open access to sociolinguistic corpora (e.g., Bullock &amp;amp; Toribio, 2013; Brown, 2019), but it furthers these practices by exploring, applying, and evaluating advanced technological tools, thereby expanding their availability to the larger community of scholars interested in the expansion and diffusion of bilingual data.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>South Asian historiography, which often takes as the bounds of its political imagination the geographical limits of state power, has been peculiarly blind to regions like the Konkan coast of western India, whose political fragmentation belie other forms of regional integration. This coast was, and is, the borderland mediating between the vast world of the Indian Ocean, and the mercantile, diasporic, ecumenical and imperial networks that operated within it, and the interior of the South Asian subcontinent. Despite its clear historical import, the coast has escaped the notice of historians as a coherent cultural region, due to its perennial political fragmentation. This paper presents an overview of a monograph project, which draws upon both early modern archival and ethnographic research to show how the Konkan must be understood as an interconnected and coherent region for both South Asian and Indian Ocean history. I focus in particular on two groups of mobile peoples and two cultural phenomena in demonstrating the regional coherence of the Konkan zone: 1) slaves and the Konkani migrant community of Kochi, Kerala and 2) deities of place and the Konkani language. By following the pathways of these people, their cosmologies and languages, I demonstrate how the Konkan coast may be 'mapped' as an Indian Ocean borderland.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>DV videotape formats face an exceptional obsolescence risk. Falling in-between professional expertise in file-based digital preservation and analog videotape digitization, DV tapes are best preserved by migrating the data from the tape into a file rather than handling them as a video digitization event. This panel will review the past two years of work on the DVRescue project. Funded by the NEH, DVRescue worked to research DV preservation and create new tools and documentation to facilitate the efficient transfer of data from tape to file. The presenters will demonstrate current versions of the tool, research conclusions, methods for troubleshooting, as well as how they will utilize findings to inform future work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation shares how two faculty members developed assignments based on ArcGIS story-maps after grant travel plans, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, were quashed by Covid-19 restrictions. Unable to explore sites for domestic travel-study, we sought alternative ways to create experiential learning around freshwater issues. We developed digital story-map assignments using ArcGIS, a software that allows dynamic ways to visualize geographical statistics but also allows students to create compelling stories to relay research findings. By creating a visually appealing story combining narrative, photographs, maps and video links, students are immersed in a high-impact learning experience, challenged to translate their newly acquired knowledge to a wider, public audience. This presentation shares how we developed, scaffolded and assessed ArcGIS story-map assignments in Freshman Composition and an Environmental Geology course.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Early colonial records suggest that an extensive trade network linked the two major branches of the Amazon River, the Rio Negro and the Solimões, with the Jurubaxí River and adjacent southern tributaries of the Rio Negro playing a key role as connecting interfluvial routes. The area of the Rio Negro was dominated by Arawakan peoples, most notably the powerful Manao, who controlled the lower to middle reaches of the Rio Negro, as well as by allied groups inhabiting the upper reaches and various tributaries (Sweet 1975, Wright 2005). The Solimões, in turn, was controlled nearly to its mouth by the Tupi-Guaranian Omagua and Yurimagua peoples. However, the degree to which these exchange networks incorporated local peoples is not well understood, and most of the groups involved had already been decimated and absorbed into the local caboclo population by the mid-18th century, in the wake of epidemics, slaving, and wars of extermination carried out by the Portuguese. Similarly, the majority of the languages once spoken throughout this region have had no speakers for centuries, and disappeared with no or minimal documentation. A key exception is the Nadëb, a people who still inhabit the interfluvial zone in the region of the Jurubaxí and neighboring rivers, and whose language belongs to the Naduhup family, associated with forest-dwelling hunters throughout the region. In this paper, we draw on our current work with Nadëb to consider linguistic clues to their role as intermediaries in past systems of exchange, informed by triangulation with historical and ethnohistorical evidence. As we explore here, indications of extensive lexical and grammatical borrowing from Tupi-Guaranian and Arawakan sources suggest that the Nadëb were deeply involved in local networks, and provide further insights into the dynamics of those networks themselves.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nominal classification is a robust feature in many Amazonian languages, and aspects of these systems offer significant challenges to our broader conception of the phenomenon. Yet a clear characterization of Amazonian classification systems must be firmly grounded in detailed descriptive analysis on one hand, and in a principled definition of classification as a typological category on the other – and a failure to do so may lead to spurious claims of typological rara. This paper offers a case in point through an exploration of nominal classification phenomena in the small Naduhup family (aka Makú; Brazil/Colombia): while several aspects of these systems have been highlighted in the typological literature as rare or otherwise remarkable, a reconsideration of these phenomena in the light of more data and analysis suggests significant revisions. We consider nominal classification phenomena across the four languages (Hup, Yuhup, Dâw, Nadëb) from synchronic and diachronic perspectives, and reassess their relevance for a broader typology of classification.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In northwestern Amazonia and beyond, many minority language communities are experiencing profound cultural and linguistic change. Such change often takes the form of language endangerment, most obviously in cases where the community language ceases to be passed on to children. However, processes of endangerment are complex: even where the everyday language is robustly transmitted, other aspects of language form and usage may still undergo change and/or loss in the context of external pressure – genres, registers, styles, and even structural features, all of which are components of global linguistic diversity and of speakers' cultural and linguistic heritage.  Such is the situation of Nadëb, a member of the small Naduhup family with about 400 speakers, as it is spoken in the community of Roçado (Amazonas state, Brazil). While Nadëb is still being passed robustly to children in Roçado, community members are well aware that transmission is faltering in some neighboring communities. They are also aware of changes in discursive practice in their own community, some of which are associated with a recent shift to evangelical Christianity, accompanied by a full translation of the New Testament into Nadëb. In this talk, we draw on collaborative fieldwork with the Nadëb people of Roçado to consider speakers' experiences with endangerment and contact-driven change as realized in grammatical structure – an area which tends to be less salient to speakers than are other targets of shift and change (see e.g. Silverstein 1981). As we explore here, speakers may nonetheless attend to structural changes, and may assess them in light of the contexts and practices that drive them.  From a typological perspective, one of Nadëb's most striking structural features is its preference for OAV constituent order, which is cross-linguistically very rare (see Weir 1984, 1986; Dryer 2013). As contact with Portuguese increases, one might anticipate pressure for Nadëb's secondary order – AVO – to</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Naduhup language family, located in northwest Amazonia, has four members: Hup, Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadëb, of which Nadëb is the most distantly related sister (Epps &amp;amp; Bolaños 2017). Despite a strong signal of cognacy in basic vocabulary, the four languages are highly divergent in their grammatical profiles and morphological forms – particularly so for Nadëb. This divergence probably has much to do with their diverse contact histories, and has likely been facilitated by structural properties that feed grammaticalization, such as noun incorporation and verb serialization (see e.g. Epps &amp;amp; Ananthanarayan forthcoming). In light of the diversity of its argument marking resources, the Naduhup family offers an intricate historical puzzle in its own right, which in turn provides insights into the diachrony of argument marking more generally. Despite their apparent recency, the historical sources of the core argument markers are not fully clear; however, those in Hup and Nadëb may represent an extension of directional and locational functions, respectively. For non-core arguments, the development of a more generic oblique suffix (-Vt) in Hup and Yuhup has probably been areally motivated via contact with Tukanoan languages (see Aikhenvald 2002 for a similar development in Tariana, Arawakan), and may derive from hut, a variant still attested in Yuhup. Similarly, Nadëb's development of pronominal subject-marking is a likely reflection of contact, involving Arawakan languages. Several postpositions show some evidence of cognacy across the family, as indicated in Table 2 above, while others may be innovations, although there is little evidence for non-adpositional sources. Finally, Nadëb has undergone a further historical stage in which the incorporation of a number of postpositions into the verb phrase has given rise to a set of verbal prefixes (example 1; see Weir 1986).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1974, a roundtable discussion published in a women's magazine offered suggestions to housewives about how they could not waste: children should be taught not to yank at the toilet paper roll so that they would not use more squares than necessary; groceries that were priced per item, like burdock root and squid, should be weighed to get the most for one's yen; leaves of the daikon radish should be fried or pickled and eaten, rather than thrown out; and pantyhose could be separated at the crotch so the whole pair would not have to be disposed of when one leg was torn.  This article was part of a proliferation of writing in the 1970s, aimed mainly at housewives and corporate management, about how to be stingy (kechi) and become part of a movement (kechikechi undo) to avoid unnecessary waste.&amp;#x0D; This paper will examine how "kechi", a word that had previously connoted the miserliness and cheapness of frugality taken too far, was redefined in largely positive terms as a desirable consciousness of waste and wastefulness in the wake of the oil shock. This kechi was not the resurrection of earlier strategies to survive dire hardship born of the necessity of survival, but a "bright" and "new" stinginess that was repurposed as a means to maintain the middle class aspirations and achievements of the "bright life" at a time when the possibility and temptation to be wasteful were real.  This remaking of kechi reflected the practices, characteristics, and concerns of an affluent, mass consumption, middle class society; rested on certain assumptions about the relationship between material comfort and happiness; and revealed the depth and tenacity of the values forged in the making of a wealthy Japan.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With the Garbage War of 1971 and the Oil Shock of 1973, issues of waste and wastefulness were catapulted to a place of visibility unprecedented in the postwar period, to the nexus of interconnected and interwoven conversations about rubbish, resources, energy, environmental awareness, consumption, and economic growth.  This presentation examines two dimensions—the significant shifts as well as the undercurrent of continuity—to the conceptions of waste and waste consciousness in the 1970s.  On the one hand, the jolts early in the decade helped inspire the idea that waste and wasting were the result of the high growth era with its promotion of a mass consumption society and culture of disposability.  Garbage was no longer considered an inconvenient byproduct of economic success, but a problem that required a rethinking of values and priorities that came to be seen as wasteful.  Practices of reuse, recycling, and the saving of resources and energy were actively promoted.  On the other hand, such substantial shifts and developments were moderated, challenged, and perhaps even undermined by the abiding allure of the conveniences, comforts, and pleasures of affluent, mass-consuming, middle-class lifestyles.  Waste consciousness was not to compromise standards of living or to dramatically change consumers' preferences and behavior.  What this presentation would like to suggest is that these conceptions of waste and wastefulness reveal a fundamental tension in the 1970s between profound skepticism about the promises of economic growth and the tenacity of the values, desires, and ways of life forged in the making of an affluent Japan.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The same space could be simultaneously assigned multiple and even conflicting values reflecting the aspirations and agendas of different observers. At the same time, the same space could acquire different meanings in the eyes of the same beholder. Personal experiences and mutating historical circumstances determined how the same person would relate to the same space at different points in time. The production of space, in other words, was open-ended even when it was not multi-vocal.  This paper uses the poems, letters, and diaries of the Fukuoka poet, nun, and loyalist Nomura Boto (1806-67) to examine the various meanings she attached to her retreat in Hirao. Boto moved to the retreat in 1845. Over the next twenty years, in parallel with changes in her personal life and in the political landscape of the country writ large, the Hirao retreat came to symbolize escapism and engagement, loss and gain, the unbearable sadness of the present and the uplifting joy of timelessness. While Boto reinvented the space of the retreat many times over, I suggest that the opposite was also true: the space transformed Boto in return, affording her opportunities that her physical body otherwise denied her and enabling her to transition from one phase of her life to the next. The production of space was thus a two-way process: the observer created a space, while the space reinvented its creator in return.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the social and economic networks of Kurosawa Tokiko (1806-1890), a female loyalist from Mito domain. In the fall of 1858 Tokiko joined the sonno joi movement in criticizing the Tokugawa government and advocating the expulsion of the foreign barbarians. In the spring of the following year she traveled to Kyoto to denounce the misguided Tokugawa policies before emperor Komei.&amp;#x0D; Much has been made, in twentieth century works, of Tokiko's "solitary" mission to Kyoto; she has been hailed for her bravery and determination in embarking on such a mission alone, despite being a woman. Tokiko herself, in the diary of her Kyoto journey, mentions the difficulties she faced for being a solitary traveler. If we look closely behind the scenes, however, we will discover a much more intricate picture than the simplistic (but irresistible) "woman travels alone" headline. Tokiko lived and worked at the intersection of several circles and neither her political education nor her journey to the capital occurred in a vacuum. An array of different social and economic networks borne out of her professional life and personal interests facilitated her access to information and provided concrete on-the-ground support before, during, and after the Kyoto mission.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the case study of Kurosawa Tokiko, a woman and political activist from the late Tokugawa period, and the various ways in which the story of her political awakening and of her subsequent 1859 undercover journey from Mito to Kyoto was told and retold in the twentieth century. The many historiographical reincarnations of Tokiko as a "woman in transit" reveal various and sometimes contrasting degrees of agency and ability to call the shots – she is alternatively portrayed as a victim of circumstances or hailed as the epitome of a free, independent, untamed spirit that all women (and even some men) should emulate. The various mutations of Tokiko in history suggest that female agency is a slippery notion and that the same individual could be presented as the maker of his or her own destiny or as a pawn in a game played by others simply by the use of a few strategic keywords and meaningful visual representations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The supernatural and inexplicable comes in handy in times of crisis as a way of explaining the unexplainable or justifying extreme measures. Late-Tokugawa Japan was one such times of crisis. Political upheaval spurred by arrival of Perry and the opening of treaty ports, coupled with extensive crop failures, rice riots, natural disasters, and a cholera epidemic, generated tensions and, in the eyes of many, underscored the ineptitude of the ruling class.&amp;#x0D; Because of the numerous challenges it faced, late-Tokugawa Japan offered fertile ground for divination. Appeals to cosmic forces took many forms, from the observation of the heavens to the interpretation of dreams or the "reading" of perfectly natural phenomena as political omens.&amp;#x0D; In this paper I present the case studies of three women who were witnesses to and involved with the political debate of the bakumatsu. By measuring the degree to which they linked (or, in one case, de-linked) politics to visions, dreams, and ghosts, I will make a case for the various rhetorical strategies deployed to endorse one's political views in the face of an ongoing and complex debate.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I examine invention patent data, oral and family histories to piece together the stories of the social impact of technological innovations on farming communities in Argentina in the late nineteenth and early centuries. Argentine farmers learned how to design machinery from the European and American machinery imported into their country. By the early twentieth century, foreigners were also learning from the Argentine farmers' patented inventions of designs of motors for tractors and combines.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My paper examines the daily life of Kurosawa Tokiko (1806-1890) in the fall of 1858. At the time Tokiko, who lived in Mito domain, was a fifty-three year old widowed mother of two who ran a small temple school (terakoya) annexed to her house and offered fortunetelling services. Her Diary of Ansei Five (Ansei gonen nikkicho) reveals a Tokiko who is not the politically inflamed activist and the visionary of her later writings, but a woman who deals with mischievous students, pickles eggplants, drinks with her neighbors, tends to the garden, and practices divination. My first goal is to inscribe the life of an ordinary person within the frame of the momentous events that defined Japanese politics and society in the summer and fall of 1858, and to assess their impact and the degree to which they were perceived among commoners. Secondly, I want to complicate the image of Kurosawa Tokiko by adding such elements as family, community, and economy to what would otherwise be strictly a political story.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I presented a global perspective of technology transfer and foreign patenting, using Argentina as a case study from 1866 to 1914. I focus on the technological transfer and patents of farm machinery and tools. My principal research questions are: How effective were imported technologies and techniques once they arrived in a farming region?  Did these foreign technologies lead to new and local patented inventions or innovations? My hypothesis is that the introduction of foreign machinery did not lead to patented domestic inventions and innovations. I examine two practices that might explain the limit to patented new inventions in farm machinery in this agro-exporting country. First, foreign manufacturers took out patents on their machinery imported to Argentina.  Second, foreign companies oftentimes purchased from local farmers the patented modifications specific to their machinery, tools, and techniques.  I created two new data sets on the importation of agricultural machinery and tools to Argentina from 1880* to 1914 and a patent data set of nearly 12,000 patent records from 1866 to 1914 to develop and test my hypothesis.  My methods include archival research of manuscript and published documents, systematic coding of invention patent records and trade data, and an interdisciplinary approach to the history of technological transfer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper looks at the ways in which selling combs, running a terakoya, offering divination services, and participating in bunjin circles enabled a 19th century female loyalist (Kurosawa Tokiko) to create a network of supporters that ultimately sustained her attempt to denounce the misguided Tokugawa policies in the wake of the Ansei Purges (1859).I will trace the contours of Tokiko's circles and show how, in her case, working and networking were deeply interconnected – Tokiko drew circles around her many "occupations." I define occupations broadly to include both pastimes, jobs that resulted in remuneration, and activities that enabled her to carve a niche in the social fabric of her village and of the surrounding areas. I do so with the understanding that to Tokiko "pastime" or "job" would not necessarily have been two separate categories – they were both occasions to display certain skills.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Nigerian city of Ìl?rin is renowned for its local, national, and international status as a centuries-old, iconic Muslim city poised between the North and South of Nigeria. However, Ìl?rin is also home to a rich Yorùbá cultural heritage that includes a diversity of practices and beliefs. Ìl?rin's cultural diversity has produced many exciting oral performance styles, such as the popular music style called Fújì characterized by what I call a "Yorùbá Muslim fusion." While predominantly Muslim men perform fújì, Muslim women perform several fújì-like, yet distinct, Yorùbá Muslim styles: Bààlúù, S?nw?l?, and Islamic. Since the Quran and hegemonic Islamic institutions oppose the role of women as public performers, Ìl?rin women artists continue to risk being marginalized as insincere and amoral women, Muslims, and citizens. Building on decades of fieldwork with Yorùbá performers and based on recent ethnographic fieldwork with Ìl?rin-based performers, this paper examines artists' life stories and performances in order to piece together a larger narrative about the politics of Yorùbá gender, class, and morality in and beyond Ìl?rin. Drawing upon the work of Barber (2000), Mahmood (2012), Na'Allah (2009), and Omojola (2012), this paper argues that women artists, through their performances, bring together the Yorùbá concept of orí (potential for final self-realization) and the Islamic concept of kádàrá (destiny), thus embodying a Yorùbá Islamic sense of self. By realizing their Yorùbá Islamic selves, these artists remind us how Yorùbá and Islamic sensibilities can enrich and sustain one another.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A proliferation of popular music genres flourished in post-independence Nigeria: highlife, jùjú, Afrobeat, and fújì. Distinct from the other genres, fújì grew out of Yorùbá Muslim communities and is a popular dance music characterized by its Islamic-influenced vocal style, Yorùbá praise poetry, and driving percussion. While fújì's original "big men"—charismatic and successful front men credited for shaping the genre—propelled fújì into popularity, lesser-known musicians in the Yorùbá city of Ìl?rin, the "Mékà of Yorùbáland," have been performing fújì since its beginning with a regional emphasis on its Islamic roots. My recent research centers on the fújì community of Ìl?rin, where I have been working with performers of fújì and fújì-related genres since 2010. This paper draws from Martin Shaw (1995), Mahmood (2005), Vargas (2012), and Shipley (2015) to ask how differently situated fújì performers challenge hegemonic discourses of gender, class, and morality that shape local and national politics in Nigeria, such as the Nigerian government's relationship with the terrorist movement, Boko Haram. This work in progress examines recent performances by Lagos-based fújì big man, Malaika, and Ìl?rin-based artist, Alhaja Sheidat Fatimah. Taking inspiration from Martin Shaw's discussion of Kikuyu gender ideology within competing discourses of female power and male dominance, this paper reveals the tensions between gendered discourses of morality and "big man" neoliberalism in the shaping of Nigeria's moral and political landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper looks at the geographical locations of colonial prisons as metaphors for spatial order, social control, and labor policies. It sheds light on the politics and economy of prison location in French Senegal. In 1820, the French opened the first prison. However by 1900, prisons mushroomed rapidly and their chosen locations were evident in the toll they exacted on the colony's landscape. Prisons were anchored around early towns, forts, commercial enclaves, trading posts, and colonial towns. By 1960, when Senegal became independent, there were a total of thirty-six prisons. This paper argues that the thoughtful locations of prisons served several purposes; prison sites created a sense of ‘territoriality' and became a metaphor for a spatial order.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Daniel Moreno in his book  Santayana the Philosopher: Philosophy as a Form of Life" (2007/2015) demonstrates how George Santayana brought together European and American intellectual traditions. His approach to Santayana is what Santayana would call literary psychology or "the art of imagining how [others] feel and think." This is the use of imaginative sympathy to grasp the perspective of another, and it makes possible the bridging of the gap between different centers of consciousness. Moreno's method demonstrates how the critical edition of  The Works of George Santayana  can be used to bridge traditions in different cultures and the distance in time between Santayana and the present day, which is what young scholars such as Michael Brodrick and Jessica Wahman do in their new books inspired by Santayana.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ancient travelers of the Darb Ayn Amur, an offshoot of the famous Darb el-Arbain which connected Kharga and Dakhla oases, were spending several days in the midst of the western desert's hostile environment. As a result, they often felt the need to leave behind them carved marks of the Divine, invoking deities who were available and willing to protect them in those desolate parts of Egypt, away from the safety of the Nile Valley. In this paper I will examine the ways in which the Divine was invoked under such circumstances, as well as the environmental factors influencing the Egyptian travelers' religious choices. The epigraphic materials presented in this paper have been recorded and investigated by the North Kharga Oasis-Darb Ayn Amur survey team and in this paper I will combine results from the ongoing epigraphic project "Ancient travelers' inscriptions from Kharga Oasis, Egypt", which has recently been funded by the National Endowment for Humanities, with current theory on the religious experience of natural landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 2001 the North Kharga Oasis-Darb Ain Amur Survey team has been exploring the sandy routes connecting Kharga Oasis to Dakhla Oasis and Libya. In the course of this survey we have discovered and recorded numerous lonely rock sites which were used in antiquity as camping spots and stopovers for travelers. The epigraphic material from these sites provides us with valuable information about the uses of these desert routes, traveling practices, as well as the identity and background of the ancient travelers who dared the western desert and chose to carve their marks on these rocks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The incorporation of signs and symbols derived from an ancient, indigenous past has a long and venerable history in the tradition of New World muralism. As an important form of public art, murals merit a more sustained consideration of content, context, and communicative intent. The use of  specific, realistic archaeological content in contemporary works is an interesting phenomenon that underscores the relation between the politics of identity (re-)construction and historical "veracity"/materiality, as well as the different of ways in which archaeology figures in society today. This paper explores the intersection of public art, community identity, and local archaeology in the context of a recently painted set of murals created by a group of local activist artists in the vicinity of Ibarra, Ecuador.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper reports on recent investigations at the late imperial site of Inca-Caranqui located at the northernmost edge of Tawantinsuyu. The interdisciplinary research initiated at the site in 2008 aims to explore the role of imperial architecture as a material strategy of Inca statecraft, and the extent to which such strategies may have evolved as a function of time and distance from the imperial capital. Investigations at the site have involved the use of GPR, geochemical studies, the experimental use of LiDAR scanning for 3D imaging, controlled excavations, and ethnohistoric research. The preliminary results of these activities are presented here.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper I will discuss some recent results from the North Kharga Oasis Survey team's epigraphic work and the National Endowment for Humanities-funded project "Ancient travelers' inscriptions from Kharga Oasis, Egypt". I will concentrate on ancient rock graffiti and pictorial carvings from a number of sites in the desert area north of Kharga Oasis that were used in antiquity as stopovers, sheltering ancient travelers from the desert's merciless, sandy winds. Among other things, this epigraphic material provides us with valuable information about the identity and background of the ancient travelers who chose to carve their marks on these rocks, turning them from lonely-standing blocks of sandstone into meaningful public spaces.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As the North Kharga Oasis Survey team continues to explore the sandy routes that connected the western desert to the Nile Valley and beyond, the archaeological and epigraphic remains from the various identified rock sites paint an intriguing picture of religious practices and ideas displayed by the ancient travelers who dared these routes. The accumulated epigraphic evidence, whose study is funded by the National Endowment for Humanities, includes numerous pictorial carvings and rock graffiti that were carved by literate and illiterate members of the Pharaonic and post-Pharaonic societies, and that invoked major and minor deities of the Egyptian pantheon who were chosen due to their personal connection to their individual carver, as well as to their benevolent presence in this part of the western desert. In this paper I will discuss such religious rock carvings in the light of their interplay with their rock sites' quasi-monumental context and their intimate relationship with the identity and background of the travelers who carved them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Few realize that Edmund Husserl theorized about sets and the causes of the set-theoretical paradoxes. Here I interpret his statements that: 1) the paradoxes show that his contemporaries did not yet have the real and genuine concept of set needed; 2) that if one is clear and distinct with respect to meaning, one readily sees the contradiction involved in the set-theoretical paradoxes; 3) that the solution to them would lie in demonstrating the shift of meaning that makes it that one is not immediately aware of the contradiction and that once one perceives it one cannot indicate wherein it lies. I study these convictions in connection with Frege's and Russell's ideas about sets and the conclusions that they came to regarding the causes of the paradoxes derivable within Frege's system.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Interest in Jonathan Edwards has reached an all-time high, as reflected in the continuous flow of books, articles, theses and dissertations on him, but also in the use of his works online. This presentation will briefly survey the development of the Edwards Center's website and online archive, then describe new texts being prepared for publication, with a special focus on those related to Native Americans and missions. Key to the growth of work on Edwards is the network of affiliate centers around the world, community-sourcing projects, the creation of educational resources, and other outreach methods that encourage engagement with Edwards's writings, times, and legacy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project has the potential to create meaningful links among the named places of Boccaccio's geographical encyclopedia. As more of the nearly 2000 entries are plotted, we anticipate gaining valuable insights into the distribution of items in Boccaccio's geographical inventory. The benefits of plotting the De montibus on a modern map are, we believe, rather obvious. However, certain aspects of this project are somewhat "betrayed" by modern cartography. To cite but a single example (and one that is readily apparent in the Fusion sample), the fantastic lake of Nilides mentioned by Juba II and Pliny as the western source of the Nile is, of course, not present in Google Maps. Plotting such geographic features, therefore, requires a certain dose of conjecture. As the project advances, it may well be that the creation of a more "medieval" cartographic representation would be more useful, one – for example – that does not take into account the Western Hemisphere, sub-Saharan Africa, Australia or the farther reaches of Asia. In this sense, it would perhaps make more sense to see the De montibus against the backdrop of a vision of the world more comparable to that of Herodotus (if not actually a T-O map). All of these questions will be better addressed as the project moves forward.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As the Humanities ever more warmly embrace the emergence of new technologies, it is imperative that scholarly editions similarly move from a once static state to one that permits the academic community to engage with them in a personalized, interactive way. Using a new NEH-funded project as a case in point, this paper demonstrates several techniques that may be utilized to facilitate the incorporation of scholar-sourcing and creative mapping in the elaboration of a far-reaching critical edition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores the problem of how perceptual experiences could be a particularly privileged source of evidence about the external world.  It argues that the pervasive assumption that perceptual evidence must consist in truths is responsible for setting a dilemma between the familiar choices of 20th-century epistemology - skepticism, coherentism, rationalism, and pure externalism - and epistemological disjunctivism.  We can get a better view, with the advantages of disjunctivism but without its costs, if we allow that subjective evidence can consist in falsehoods.  But not every way of doing so can succeed, because we must also correctly account for the defeasibility of perceptual evidence.  I explore and defend a new account of basic perceptual evidence that makes good on this promise.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>R&amp;amp;B singer Baby Huey (a.k.a. James Ramey) and his band, The Babysitters, are part of my forthcoming book, "Move On Up: Chicago Soul Music and the Rise of Black Cultural Power" (University of Chicago Press, 2017). Before Baby Huey's untimely death in 1970 at age 26, his band represented a commingling of different backgrounds and music during a time and place that is generally considered deeply segregated. This group of mostly African American musicians originally became popular within Chicago's predominantly white music venue's on the city's North Side. At the same time, the group drew from sources in black music as well as the identifiers of late-'60s rock music, particularly electric guitar leads and feedback. The presentation examines how the group was a small, yet influential, movement of integrated bands that were performing in Chicago at that time, including Rotary Connection and Rufus. I also look at how much the band's roots in Indiana fueled its initial inspiration before moving onto bigger stages across the state line. As part of a larger work on soul music in Chicago, I have been researching this subject for 10 years and primary sources include interviews with people who were part of Baby Huey's ensemble.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper argues that construction of the myth of "Partisan Glory" went through three stages that broadly coincide with late Stalinism, Khrushchevian destalinization, and Brezhnevite stagnation. In the first, the regime's main emphasis was on sifting out all elements of resistance whose behavior under occupation did not fully meet its unrealistic expectations of ideological orthodoxy and fanatical self-abnegation. As a result, what emerged from officially sanctioned accounts was a partisan glory without partisans, so scarce was registry of names of those officially recognized as worthy of this title. In the second, regime displayed interest in rehabilitating some of the previously vilified and repressed "traitors", especially former communists, even if their wartime record was uneven at best. The notion of "restoring good name to honest communists," some of whom were pronounced heroes, carried implication of the party rediscovering its true sole. It also tended to lend credence to Khrushchev's claims to rejuvenation of the country. In the third, Brezhnev's leadership endeavored to boost the regime's legitimacy by involving as many people as possible in the celebration of its myths. Consequently, it proved willing to confer the title of "partisan" on many a person whose role in the movement was marginal. In each of those phases former resisters, whether real or false, actively participated in shaping and reshaping the public discourse on "Partisan Glory" either by denouncing their comrades as "traitors" or lending their testimony to party's search for reasons to rehabilitate them, or actively seeking recognition for their friends and acquaintances. Shaping and reshaping the "Partisan Glory" was thus a fully social enterprise. This goes some way towards explaining its tenacity and longevity far beyond the fall of communism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This papers explores individual trajectories that brought people into the ranks of pro-Soviet armed resistance in southern Ukraine. It argues that on par with groups organized by the Soviets before their withdrawal from the region there appeared autonomous groups, organized by groups of Soviet citizens on their own initiative. Their motivations were different by ultimately, they were driven by the desire to avenge their injured national pride. The paper also argues that some persons who initially participated in the ranks of Ukrainian nationalist underground later in the war joined pro-Soviet groups.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rivero (1994) makes a distinction between true imperatives (imperatives with unique morphology) and surrogate imperatives (imperatives that make use of the morphology of other moods or features). For negative commands, some languages use true imperative with negation and others use surrogate imperatives. Zejlstra (2004) attempts to capture this phenomenon in an interesting generalization, namely, that only languages in which the negative is X° impose a ban on true negative imperative. This paper reviews this generalization in the light of data from Tanzanian Bantu languages of Kikisi, Kindendeule, Chingoni, and Kimatuumbi, all of which have postverbal negative clitic and use surrogate negative. The particles are ndali (Kikisi), yee (Kindendeule), hee (Chingoni) and lí (Kimatuumbi). The data show that the negative particles exhibit distributional features of adverbs. This paper argues that the post-verbal position of the particle is a result of movement of the verb to a position higher than the adjunction position of the negative. As an adverb, it does not prevent the verb from moving across. This accounts for why in spite of being in post-verbal position, it takes scope over the preceding predicate. The languages in this study do not have a true negative imperative. The verb morphology used for imperative cannot combine with negation to express a negative command. Instead, a negative command is expressed by the prohibitive      –somu (Kikisi), -koto (Kindendeule and Chingoni)  ‘stop' and –kotoka  (Kimatuumbi) ‘do not do' together with an infinitive form of the main verb. Kindendeule also allows an infinitive verb followed by the negative particle yee. The paper argues that the ban on negative imperative is due to the adjunction occurring too low to have scope over the illocutionary force in ForceP.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the Bantu languages of Kikisi (G67), Kiswahili (G42a), Kindendeule (N101) and Chingoni (N12), the subjunctive is a grammatical category that stands in contrast with the indicative mood. Morphologically, the subjunctive is characterized by the verbal suffix –e (or some other variants). Semantically, the subjunctive expresses irrealis and is therefore associated with irrealis-inducing environments such as irrealis-inducing adverbs and complements of manipulative verbs (Givón 1994).&amp;#x0D;  This paper describes the subjunctive in these languages and explores its morphosyntactic characteristics. Drawing on work by Quer (2006) and Stowell (1993), this paper identifies its distribution and its semantic features. It argues that the subjunctive ambiguously exhibits Inflection or Tense features as well as COMP features. With respect to Inflection features, it is in complementary distribution with tense marking. However, it displays COMP features in its selectional relations with the superordinate volitional and directive predicates. This ambiguity is accounted for if we adopt Rizzi's (1997) proposal an of an articulated CP. The Inflection features are FinP features and the COMP features ForceP features all on the left periphery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Building on Quilligan's discussion of the female perspective in Book III of The Faerie Queene, Berger's emphasis on "conspicuous allusion," and De Laurretis's notion of "technologies of gender," this talk focuses on "technologies of desire" in Spenser's Legend of Chastity. These include discourses but also other media—representational apparatuses of all sorts that evoke erotic feeling and shape it as experience and as expression.  Spenser's concern with such technologies surfaces immediately in the proem, as it mirrors (and foreshadows) the Busyrane episode, and later in an allegory that seeks to represent representation along with the damage it can do, as images, objects, creatures, and characters disappear from the narrated action, quite literally absorbed into discourse. Against the pervasive harm of unchaste discourse, Spenser poses on the one hand a utopian fantasy of untrammeled freedom in erotic address, and on the other a visionary quest for the ungesehenmachen ("making-unhappened") of the amorous discourses dominant in Elizabethan literature, staged as a re-virgination of the culture's erotic imagination. These concerns re-emerge in Amoretti and Epithalamion and carry over into the 1596 installment of The Faerie Queene, where Scudamore appears as a failed counterpart to the poet-speaker of Spenser's sonnet sequence and marriage poem. The Dance of the Graces in canto x of Book VI offers a culminating version of the utopian fantasy of unconstrained erotic celebration, located now in the intimacy of the nuptial relation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents a description of Kikisi expressions whose prototypical function is to modify nouns. Kikisi (G67), a Bantu language spoken in the southern highlands of Tanzania, has not been previously described. Thompson (1988) termed the expressions that modify nouns property concept words. The most well-studied property concept expressions are adjectives. However, adjectives as a lexical category is disputed by some as a universal category. The paper seeks to answer three questions:  (a) How are property concepts expressed in Kikisi? (b) What morphosyntactic properties characterize adjectives? (c) How is gradation and intensification expressed? Following Dixon's (2004) survey findings, Kikisi is identified as a language with a closed adjective class. Other property concepts are nominal in the form of associative structure and possessive form, and verbal property concepts in the form of finite relative and infinitival relatives. Intensification of property concepts is accomplished by the adverb nesu ‘very' or specific ideophones. The comparative form is a periphrastic item that means ‘to surpass.'</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a study of demonstratives in Kikisi and Kindendeule, Bantu languages spoken in southern Tanzania. Kindendeule has five demonstratives and Kikisi has four. The demonstratives are based on spatial relations between the speaker, the addressee, and the object referred to. They may be proximal to the speaker, addressee or neutral. In addition the speaker may use medial or distal distinctions to point or refer to other objects. With respect to form, the demonstratives exhibit agreement with the head of the noun phrase, an agreement that appears in the form of reduplication. The same demonstrative forms appear in pronominal positions, in noun phrases, and as arguments in copula constructions. In addition there is an adverbial demonstrative naha ‘this/that way.'&amp;#x0D; The demonstratives have four different functions: (i) They provide deictic reference by pointing at the object referred to discourse; (ii) the medial demonstrative serves in addition as a marker of definiteness, very much like definite articles; (iii) they may occupy the pronoun positions; (iv) co-reference with antecedents as well as nominal or verbal expressions that appear after the demonstratives.&amp;#x0D; The fact that what Diessel (1999) calls demonstrative pronouns, demonstrative determiner and demonstrative identifiers have the same form gives rise to the question of what is their categorial status. Also consider the fact that Kindendeule does not have 3rd person pronouns. However, demonstratives can function as third person pronouns. This study concludes that the distribution of demonstratives suggests they are determiners just like pronouns, consistent with a proposal dating back to Postal (1966).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the Bantu languages of Kikisi, Kiswahili, Kindendeule and Chingoni, the subjunctive is a grammatical category that stands in contrast with the indicative mood. This contrast is exemplified in the following sentences with the verb kusoma ‘to read.'&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; (1)a.Juma a-na-som-a ki-tabu.&amp;#x0D; JumaSM-PR-read-INDbook&amp;#x0D; ‘Juma is reading a book.'&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; b.Ni-na-tak-a Juma a-som-e ki-tabu.&amp;#x0D; I-PR-want-INDJumaSM-read-SUBJbook&amp;#x0D; ‘I want Juma to read a book.'&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; c.Juma a-som-e ki-tabu&amp;#x0D; JumaSM-read-SUBJbook&amp;#x0D; ‘Juma should read a book.'&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Morphologically, the subjunctive is characterized by the verbal suffix –e (or some other variants), absence of tense marking, and the obligatory presence of the subject and/or object marker. Two types of subjunctive are illustrated (Quer 2005; Stowell 1993): (i) Intentional subjunctives that are triggered by matrix predicates (1b), and (ii) polarity subjunctives that are licensed by some operator (1c). The subjunctive ambiguously exhibits Inflection or Tense features as well as COMP features. With respect to Inflection features, it is in complementary distribution with tense marking. However, it displays COMP features in its selectional relations with the superordinate volitional and directive predicates. This ambiguity is accounted for if we adopt Rizzi's (1997) proposal of articulated CP. The Inflection features are FinP features and the COMP features ForceP features.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presenters will share the rich research value of historic newspapers and how to use Chronicling America, a freely accessible newspaper database on the Library of Congress website with over 17 million newspaper pages  (https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov). Newspapers are a valuable resource to many researchers: K-12 and college students, educators, genealogists, academic researchers, and the general public. Chronicling America can be utilized to research family history, find primary sources for National History Day projects, learn the history of a local town, and so much more. This session will prepare attendees to offer historic newspapers and Chronicling America as tools for their library users. In addition, participants will find out how to consult Chronicling America state partners in Maryland and Delaware as a resource for digitizing historic newspaper titles at their institutions or in their local communities. Session participants are encouraged to bring a laptop to complete a learning activity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presenters from the Historic Maryland Newspapers Project (HMNP) at the University of Maryland Libraries and the Maryland State Archives (MSA) share their process for developing a statewide social media campaign to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment in Maryland and display examples of campaign posts on their poster. A special emphasis was placed on historic newspapers, especially Maryland titles digitized by HMNP for inclusion in the Library of Congress online newspaper collection, Chronicling America. Several other cultural heritage institutions from throughout the state joined the campaign posting newspapers and other archival materials in their collections about women's suffrage in Maryland. It was a great opportunity for organizations without dedicated communications staff to join a coordinated outreach effort. Together, the participating institutions celebrated the centennial of the 19th Amendment showing historical documents, articles, and images related to women's suffrage in Maryland, and the posts can continue to be viewed through the campaign's unique hashtags: #MarylandWomenVote and #MDSuffrage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified February 3, 1870, gave African American men in America the right to vote. It was the third and last of the Reconstruction amendments. While women's suffrage took another fifty years, the arrival of African American men at the polls promised a dramatic change in politics and society. Historians have long wrestled with the question of whether the amendment was a success or a failure. In this talk, Don Debats explores newly discovered electoral records that enhance our understanding of an amendment many called, "the greatest gain of the Civil War."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Itamar Even-Zohar has queried, what if the translated work maintains the central position within a literary polysystem and influences the literary history of another country? Ernest Hemingway was "rediscovered" during Nikita Khrushchev's reengagement with the West and became a ubiquitous cultural figure with his portrait found in Soviet apartments during the 1960s and ‘70s. Ivan Kashkin and his school of translators first offered Hemingway to Soviet readers in 1934, but it was his posthumously published Ernest Hemingway. A Critical-Biographical Study (1966), which significantly informed the first Soviet biography (1970) of the American author. In this paper, I will focus on Kashkin and this late-Soviet version of Hemingway. Kashkin had equated the inner lives of Hemingway's characters with the author himself. As a result, when Soviet readers found characters who directly reflected their own outlook on life, their inner world seemed to align with Hemingway's. Readers could empathize with Hemingway in ways that they might not with Count Lev Tolstoi or the cosmopolitan writer Il'ia Ehrenburg. Because this reading was so personalized, there was a connection with an author who also offered an escape from the Soviet reality.   In 1985, Sergei Davlotov argued that Hemingway had somehow become embedded in various spheres of daily Soviet life. His books were prominently displayed in most homes of the Soviet intelligentsia. His portraits frequently appeared in popular journals. For a generation of Soviet youth, it was even trendy to quote from Hemingway's works. Despite the dissimilarities, Hemingway had become a Soviet writer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ernest Hemingway and the NKVD Was Ernest Hemingway a Soviet spy and if so, why? Documents have revealed that Hemingway was recruited as an NKVD source in 1941. He was assigned the codename "Argo" and met with Soviet agents several times in the following years, but never provided the Soviets with any valuable information. In this paper, I will suggest a plausible answer for why Hemingway might have worked with the NKVD.  During the Spanish Civil War, Hemingway was friends with the Soviet documentarian Roman Karmen, journalists Mikhail Kol'tsov and Ilya Ehrenburg, NKVD Station Chief Alexander Orlov and others.

		<Abstract>Using examples from 8 Arabic medical commentaries composed between the 1160s and 1520, I show that: a) Medicine did not go into decline in the post-1200 period in Islamic societies; b) Ibn al-Nafis (d. 1288) and his new interventions and transformations of medical theory were engaged with, accepted and/or subsequently transformed in the later period taking Arabic medicine beyond the pale of the Greek tradition; c) these new developments were themselves indebted to a new style of commentary that encouraged such systematic investigations and evaluations of theory; and d) far from medicine and philosophy going their separate ways in this period, physicians remained conversant in philosophy in this period since at least three of these 8 commentaries were the most copied and used medical works by medical practitioners for the next 500 years across the Islamic world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper considers two points about teaching chivalry. First, chivalry is often taught essentially as a charming theory of behavior, but what happens when reality meets theory is explored far less. Second, though chivalry and just war tradition each played a major role in medieval society, they are often inexplicably separated. To address these points, this paper treats the pairing of chivalry and just war in the classroom context of medieval applications (ius in bello). The paper draws from my experiences teaching the standard medieval history survey, an upper-division crusades course, and a "History of Just War" seminar funded by my National Endowment for the Humanities Enduring Questions Pilot Course Grant (2010-2012) for the project, "Is there such a thing as a just war?" Case studies include student research projects on Richard I's slaughter of Muslim prisoners at Acre, crusades events from Muslim and Christian perspectives, and Joan of Arc's leadership. The paper also revisits my article, "Chivalry: A Door to Teaching the Middle Ages," The History Teacher 28 (1995), published before the post-9/11 perspective that, for better and worse, is the major prism through which students view these issues, often with a presentist or ahistorical lens.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Two rural traditions of sung poetry in Timor—separated by 300 kilometers and belonging to different language families—exhibit similar processes of poetic fragmentation.  In both traditions, the poems are couplets, but each tradition has its own metrical pattern, applied uniformly to every line.  Couplets, chosen extemporaneously by the singers, are sung to strophic melodies, one line per strophe.  Each tradition's invariable meter divides the lines of poetic text into units, which, in singing, are interspersed among vocables and extraneous words that are fixed, always the same and falling in the same places in every statement of the melody.  Thus there are two levels of sung text: the poetic text, changing with every strophe, and the melodic text, which belongs to the melody and must be repeated every time.  Any couplet may be sung to any melody, but every melody has its own template of melodic text, so the same couplet will be realized differently in different melodies.  Between couplets, singers may shift from one melody to another; this entails switching templates, which constitutes a challenge and, I suggest, an aesthetic pleasure.  A search in the literature has yet to turn up counterparts to this system, but often published studies of sung poetry give "fillers" short shrift, leaving it unclear whether they are fixed and requisite elements or casual and variable insertions.  So, two questions: is this interweaving of fixed melodic text and changing poetic text known in other traditions?  And how could such a counterintuitive system come about?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While solo singing and singing in monophonic or heterophonic choruses are common throughout Island Southeast Asia (and polyphonic choruses are also found, though less frequently), singing in polyphonic duet is extremely rare.  It is known only in two circumscribed regions in the islands—one on Flores and one, some 450 km to the east, on Timor—and also, farther afield (another 2,270 km east from Timor), in the Manus Islands east of New Guinea.  All three traditions are characterized not only by the duet format itself, but by the pervasive presence of harmonic seconds (major, minor, and approximate), and the duets of Flores and Timor—although practiced by speakers of contrasting language families—have many other similarities as well.  (The Melanesian tradition, with fewer similarities to the others, may for the purposes of our presentation be considered an outlier.)  The presence of two geographically separate traditions, strongly resembling each other but remarkably different from any other (known) traditions in the 17,000 islands of the region, presents what Rappoport calls (2010) an enigma. We propose to offer, in a combined, double-length paper, a detailed analytical comparison of the duet traditions of Flores and Timor.  The presentation will feature field recordings and transcriptions derived from our individual research among Lamaholot-speakers in the Tanjung Bunga (TB) region of eastern Flores (Indonesia) and  Fataluku (FL)-speakers at the eastern tip of Timor (Timor-Leste).  When considered in broad terms, the traditions have a striking number of features in common.  Yet when examined in detail, most of these features occur in contrasting forms in TB and FL.  The ethnographic contexts also differ significantly. Our aim is to highlight the similarities and differences, not to explain them.  Nevertheless, one plausible hypothesis, backed up by some TB origin-narratives (though not yet investigated with regard to DNA), inescapably presents itself: that these two</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How can we excavate experiences of enslaved people from archives that systematically exclude enslaved voices, while negotiating the demands of a liberal sensibility that requires subjects to speak for themselves? In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan. They had been caught, terrifyingly, between two factions struggling over who would succeed their dead master, a Né (or Yi) native hereditary chieftain, as the sovereign of his extensive domain. Their plaint, which named the slaves as its collective author, was written in Chinese, a language they could neither speak nor write. This paper traces their footsteps as they accompanied their master's widow to the prefectural capital, found a cut-rate litigation master to fashion their plaint, then dispersed through the city on errands for their master's widow. I think about how the slaves' own form of spatial literacy, developed through their service in their master's house and participation in his rituals, might have helped them read and navigate the unfamiliar city. Thinking through the specificities of how slaves became writers and readers also helps better delineate the shape of slavery in Né places, which have served as China's designated "slave societies," despite widespread slavery in every region and economic sector of the Empire. I argue that the native chieftain system itself became a system of bondage in Qing society, confining Né and other ‘non-Chinese' to mountain enclaves while extracting their wealth and using their lives in military actions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archivists, textual scholars, and historians often produce digital editions of historical documents. Using markup schemes such as those of the Text Encoding Initiative and EpiDoc, these digital editions often record documents' semantic regions (such as notes and figures) and physical features (such as page and line breaks) as well as transcribing their textual content. We describe methods for exploiting this semantic markup as distant supervision for training and evaluating layout analysis models. In experiments with several model architectures on the half-million pages of the Deutsches Textarchiv (DTA), we find a high correlation of these region-level evaluation methods with pixel-level and word-level metrics. We discuss the possibilities for improving accuracy with self-training and the ability of models trained on the DTA to generalize to other historical printed books.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents a finite-state morphological analyzer for the Gitksan language. The analyzer draws from a 1250-token Eastern dialect wordlist. It is based on finite-state technology and additionally includes two extensions which can provide analyses for out-of-vocabulary words: rules for generating predictable dialect variants, and a neural guesser component. The pre-neural analyzer, tested against interlinear-annotated texts from multiple dialects, achieves coverage of (75-81%), and maintains high precision (95-100%). The neural extension improves coverage at the cost of lowered precision.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper argues that Gershwin's An American in Paris is a modernist musical manifesto—a statement of the composer's ambition to write musically sophisticated yet accessible music that made money. It examines Gershwin's work from three perspectives: as popular modernism, as a synthesis of program and absolute musics, and as an exemplar of Gershwin's economics. Sources include an overlooked 1920 Gershwin interview, discoveries from the work's new critical edition, and financial documents from contemporary newspapers and the Library of Congress. It concludes that Gershwin's music is more modern and compositionally rich than typically understood, while serving to make classical music pay.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ABSTRACT OF "GOING TO JACKSON: the Mississippi State Hospital in Faulkner and Welty"  Since opening its doors in Jackson in 1855, the Mississippi State Hospital has played a powerful role in the public imagination as reflected in The Sound and the Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930), The Ponder Heart (1953) and several of Welty's short stories.  As a variation on the southern gothic mansion, the "lunatic asylum" in Faulkner and Welty mocks and mirrors institutions—plantation house, hotel, bank, church, courthouse, the Old Ladies Home, and prison.  In sending their protagonists by train to Jackson, the authors question definitions of sanity, the role of the exiled artist, and race relations of the post-bellum south.  More particularly, we see how the fate of Welty's Uncle Daniel Ponder is in part a reply to Faulkner's Benjy Compson and Darl Bundren.  Amid scenes of humor, violence, and sexuality, the historical State Hospital is transformed into a potent symbol of social change and individual conscience.  AUTHOR BIO Michael Gleason has been introducing Millsaps undergrads to Homer, Virgil, and Beowulf since 1994.  He has published on the Latin of Bede and Alcuin and (with Anne MacMaster) the imagery of the bat in Homer and Joyce, the Circes of Joyce and Welty, and Native Americans in  Hawthorne and Faulkner.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Legal Authority of Merchants and Brokers in India's French Courts The importance of commercial brokers to the trading world of the eighteenth century, and especially the Indian Ocean, has long been recognized. Through their familial, religious, linguistic, and generational connections, such brokers were at the absolute center of globe-spanning networks of commercial exchange. This paper examines how comercial brokers and other merchants engaged with the French Compagnie des Indes in India were also crucial legal agents in Pondichéry's French-run courts. Although these courts were staffed by French colonial officials, and dispensed law according to legal codes imported from Paris, commercial brokers and other local merchants were responsible for bringing forward suits, managing their evolution during witness testimonies, and even making decisions regarding sentencing and punishment. Their unofficial roles in French-arbitrated legal matters were recognized and eagerly encouraged by the colony's French courts. Focusing on a 1743 criminal litigation by the Pondichéry Superior Council regarding the trafficking and enslavement of a large group of Indian men, women and children by a French trader and his local broker, this paper shows how ostensibly French law, derived from metropolitan codes, was enmeshed in the same familial and linguistic networks that facilitated trade in a French colonial city on the Coromandel Coast.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since the early work by Aryon Rodrigues (based on the fieldnotes of Franz Caspar), Tuparí has been analyzed as exhibiting a particular morphosyntactic phenomenon known as "relational prefixes." The existence of these prefixes in Tuparí has been used to argue for specific historical reconstructions for the Proto-Tupí language (spoken some four to five millennia ago) and for more distant genealogical relationships between disparate South American language families. In this talk I demonstrate that the Tuparí facts have been misdescribed: this language does not, in fact, exhibit "relational prefixes" as these are commonly understood. With this revised synchronic picture in place, Tuparí no longer provides any evidence for the reconstruction of "relational prefixes" in Proto-Tupí. Furthermore, the speculative connections between Proto-Tupí and Proto-Macro-Jê are found to lack sufficient empirical foundation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I was an invited respondent to Collins' plenary lecture. In his paper, he argues for a model of integrating science, religion, and social philosophy that he entitles ‘critical co-opting.' He then cites Jonathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind as a resource in applying the findings of behavioral science to addressing issues in value theory (religious and secular). My response introduced questions about naturalizing ethics and social philosophy that were clearly informed by my participation in the NEH seminar.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract: Many programs in social epistemology—which reject the individualistic assumptions of much traditional epistemology—hold that our practice of belief-regulation should be evaluated chiefly by how it promotes narrowly epistemic goals (e.g., truth, or justified belief, or knowledge).  However, promotion of narrowly epistemic goals cannot be the only function of a healthy epistemic practice.  Human community—indeed, rational agency itself—cannot exist without a vast store of common ground: shared background beliefs about norms and institutions, but also factual beliefs about the shared world we inhabit.  Given this, it follows that a central function of any society's epistemic practice must be doxastic coordination—that is, the production of consensus sufficient to enable community, communication, and coordination.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Traditional analyses of knowledge (such as JTB+ conceptions of knowledge, and even many conceptions from within the social epistemology tradition) treat knowledge as an individual status or state, analyzable largely in terms of individual epistemic agents.  I argue that most knowledge is better represented as a collective resource—literally, a commons (in the traditional sense of a resource that is available and usable by an entire community).  Further, to the extent that we can talk about knowledge as something possessed by individual agents, such possession will usually be not merely causally but instead logically dependent upon the existence of the knowledge commons.  Thus, individual instances of knowing are generally strongly parasitic on the existence of the knowledge commons. Previous work on knowledge as a commons has overwhelmingly addressed itself to a specific issue, namely, the ‘fencing off' of the commons represented by placing knowledge (such as academic articles) behind paywalls.  I instead propose to pursue the more radical understanding of the knowledge commons outlined above.  It will turn out that understanding knowledge in this way forces us to reconceive of much of our epistemic practice, including the very goal of epistemic assessment itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bernard Williams's essay "Internal and External Reasons" presents a now-classic challenge to the categorical bindingness of moral reasons. I argue that for Sellars, moral reasons are internal (in Williams's sense), but nevertheless categorically valid for rational beings. This conclusion follows largely because of Sellars's radically social conception of reasons. Reasons internalism is often tied to the Humean theory of reasons (HTR). Sellars's anti-reductionist and anti-individualist conception of reasons presents a powerful challenge to the HTR: A significant range of reasons have a social and intersubjective dimension that resists a Humean analysis. Indeed, most reasons we have display this anti-Humean character; and to focus only on reasons that admit of a Humean, individualistic analysis is to leave us with a violently truncated agent—indeed, one who might not even be a rational agent. The intermediate conclusion is that most reasons are social—we are subject to them not qua individuals but qua members of a society, occupying various roles and identities. The strategy suggested by Sellars's approach—which holds to the inherently social nature of reasons—is to argue that reasons are already, by their nature, inherently public; that to occupy the standpoint of rational agency is to occupy the standpoint of the ‘we' and to be bound by its norms, including its moral norms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines legal challenges by Filipino patients and their families to the American colonial government's policy on the mandatory confinement of Hansen's disease patients in government leprosaria. The legal challenges by Filipino patients and their families to the Segregation Law are understudied in the scholarship. Two broad issues in the history of medicine and public health – criminalization of disease and tensions between individual rights and public health – are illuminated in this study. These issues are relevant to public health incidents in the twenty-first century, especially to the global COVID-19 pandemic.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper explores some surprising and unexpected 19th-century antecedents to the comics medium. While comics historians have focused narrowly on certain graphic artists, they have not looked at a broader revolution in the history of narrative art. The paper examines the tradition of 'storytelling in squares,' by which visual narratives moved from panel to panel or from print to print. This mode of storytelling appeared across 19th-century media: the paper studies painting sequences as well as photographic scenes in the stereoscope. This research emerges from Chapter 1 of  Picture World , on caricature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Esta ponencia se centra en la creación artística de la monja pintora española Estefanía de la Encarnación tal como la describe en su autobiografía espiritual de 1631 en relación a otros testimonios, más fragmentarios, de otras monjas-artistas españolas. Estefanía se crió entre artesanos y cortesanos en Madrid, y tomó los votos en la villa ducal de Lerma en un monasterio de clarisas, la mayoría provenientes de la aristocracia, excusándosele la dote a cambio de su labor como pintora. A lo largo de la Vida, Estefanía cuenta sobre de su práctica artística antes y después de su profesión religiosa. Como el relato más detallado de la actividad de una monja-pintora de la época, las descripciones que ofrece de su creación de imágenes dentro del claustro proporcionan un contexto para examinar la producción plástica de otras mujeres religiosas, desde María Santísima de la Trinidad, una mercedaria analfabeta de Sevilla, hasta dos hermanas cultas de alta alcurnia, María de San Alberto y Cecilia del Nacimiento, que profesaron como carmelitas descalzas en Valladolid. A través de los relatos hagiográficos y autobiográficos más fragmentarios de estas mujeres y otras, exploramos hasta qué punto las experiencias descritas por Estefanía —como, por ejemplo, el uso de la oración como preparación para la creación de imágenes sagradas, el conflicto entre la pintura y la vida contemplativa o los enfrentamientos con el demonio cuando éste intentaba frustrar la producción artística— eran comunes a las monjas pintoras y esculturas. ¿Llegaron estas experiencias a constituir una conciencia artística femenina?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1633, the Franciscan painter-nun Estefanía de la Encarnación (Madrid ca. 1597-Lerma 1665) was censured by Inquisition officers in Madrid for circulating prayer beads that she claimed functioned as sacred relics. According to Estefanía's spiritual autobiography, her Vida of 1631 (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de España, MS 7450; Universidad de Salamanca, Biblioteca General Histórica, Ms. 1730), the Virgin and the persons of the Trinity had consecrated the beads in her presence, thus transforming them into relics touched by the divine. In a memorandum condemned by the Inquisition, Estefanía also maintained that wearers of the beads received certain "virtues" (virtudes) and "graces" (gracias) along with indulgences that would reduce their time in purgatory. The officers declared this assertion a violation of papal authority, issuing a warning to Estefanía and prohibiting her beads from circulating. This paper locates Estefanía's account of the beads in the contexts of Catholic Reformation definitions of orthodoxy and discourse on sacred objects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the importance of painting and visual imagery in the spiritual autobiography of Estefanía Encarnación (ca. 1597-1665). Looking at Estefania's account of her artistic development in her 1631 Vida, we first uncover the profound ambivalence she betrays towards her talent as both a divine gift that led her to God and a source of worldly vanity that took her from prayer. We then turn to her increasing dedication to writing and to the pictorial language she uses to convey her visions of divine love: a language rooted in the tradition of the Song of Songs and the spiritual Petrarchism of sacred poetry. Finally, we consider her surviving mural painting of St. John the Evangelist in La Ascención, her convent in Lerma, as a meta-reflection of her own writing as divine revelation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This roundtable addresses approaches to unpacking racial dynamics of nineteenth- and twentieth-century vernacular hymnals from the southern United States from the perspectives of volume editors, editorial staff, and an editorial board member developing digital scholarly editions of such texts. These editions include hymnals created by and for Black, white, and Native American communities in the US South and its diasporas between the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. All are part of Sounding Spirit, a National Endowment for the Humanities–funded research lab that publishes scholarly editions and thematic collections examining race, place, religion, and culture in southern vernacular sacred music publishing. The hymnals included in Sounding Spirit feature diverse genres ranging from gospel to spirituals, dispersed harmony to "scientific" music. The editions, which pair high resolution page images with critical introductions and contextual annotations, analyze how these hymnals refracted the racial politics of the US South and its diasporas. The sacred music making represented by these works was connected to oppressive structures of slavery, Jim Crow, and Indian Removal. Hymnals also furthered resistance to racial discrimination in connection with the establishment of Black denominations and colleges and document complex relationships to settler colonial missionizing among Native Americans through hymn translation and composition. In this roundtable, moderated by Sounding Spirit managing editor Meredith Doster, volume editors Sarah Snyder Hopkins and Jesse P. Karlsberg (also the series editor-in-chief) and James Abbington (a member of the series editorial board) will discuss how they approach the racial contexts of these texts through scholarly editing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>independent reality. His theory of picturing is meant to fill this gap, but I offer two arguments that it cannot. First, if our talk of objects in general is not really intentionally related to mind-independent objects, then this is also true of our talk of objects' bearing picturing relations to our language, in which case the appeal to picturing provides no additional constraint. Second, Sellars' deflationary analysis of causal statements precludes an adequate defense of our justification for taking statements to picture the world adequately.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>C. I. Lewis's epistemology is chiefly remembered for his "pragmatic a priori," on which our choice of conceptual schemes is pragmatically grounded. But Lewis also defended an independent pragmatism about empirical meaning, on which our conception of an object just is our conception of its manifestations in experience. There is significant apparent tension between these two pragmatisms: the former suggests a proto-Quinean rejection of immutable analytic truth and epistemically significant "given" experience, while the latter presupposes these features of the empiricism Quine attacks. Recent interpreters have read Lewis as a proto-Quinean on these issues, but I argue that on both, Lewis affirmed the empiricist position. I then offer an interpretation of the function of the pragmatic a priori consistent with this empiricist reading: namely, supplying grounds for selection of a particular logical system, as well as of a particular theory or conceptual scheme in cases of underdetermination by given experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper I will explore new contexts for Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich's court theater (1672?1676), using the kinds of communications other presenters will be discussing at this workshop: news and diplomatic reports, letters and official dispatches. By combining these accounts with less traditional kinds of communication—theatrical conventions, stage actions, and other court imagery—I would like to engage in a discussion of how these broader sources might offer new ways to look at the Muscovite court theater. I will focus on Temir-Aksakovo deistvo (The Play of Tamerlane), a play written in early 1675 and performed again later that year.  This work will serve as a focal point, from which we can expand to consider the web of communication among many different participants: the playwrights, actors, and audiences in Moscow and their counterparts in the West. What can we learn from their interactions and are there broader implications for our view of late Muscovite culture? How does this approach give us new ways to understand the court theater as a continuum of influences and expectations?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The question of how much the diplomatic policy makers in Muscovy knew about political&amp;#x0D; events beyond the Muscovite borders is still being debated, some scholars believing the level&amp;#x0D; of knowledge was quite low, others asserting the opposite. The formal documentation&amp;#x0D; concerning the relatively infrequent embassies sent abroad—instructions to ambassadors and&amp;#x0D; their reports (stateinye spiski) on returning to Moscow—have been mined for what they&amp;#x0D; reveal, but that is only a small part of the evidence that needs to be examined. Clearly over&amp;#x0D; time between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the information level of the Muscovite&amp;#x0D; Diplomatic Chancery (Posol'skii prikaz) improved substantially, thanks in part to the&amp;#x0D; development of a regular means of acquiring foreign newspapers, which were then translated&amp;#x0D; or summarized in what we know as the kuranty. This paper highlights other important&amp;#x0D; sources from which foreign news was obtained: the reports of trusted agents, some of them&amp;#x0D; resident abroad, reports submitted by border commanders based in part on the interrogation&amp;#x0D; of merchants and others entering Muscovite territory, and the reports obtained by various&amp;#x0D; clandestine means such as the sending of spies into other countries. A systematic&amp;#x0D; examination of this kind of evidence is going to be necessary if a full picture of the&amp;#x0D; information level of the Posol'skii prikaz is to be obtained and if we then wish to determine&amp;#x0D; to what degree foreign policy decisions were contingent on the acquisition of foreign news.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In our presentation, we will describe Koch's role as an informant about political and cultural news from Moscow. We will also try to determine whether the content of his lengthy reports, which were received by multiple persons both in Sweden's Baltic territories and at the court in Stockholm, can be traced in printed newspapers. Finally, we will try to answer the question of why Koch entered Swedish service at all, in light of his commercial activities in Moscow, which would have provided him with a steady income.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Closing lecture (conferencia de clausura) at Cologne Summer School: 'Serendipia: Migracion como oportunidad', University of Cologne, Germany&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The city of Ghent, the most populous north of Paris in the fourteenth century, was established with its town council around the sites of the castle of the Counts of Flanders and  two very old and important Benedictine abbeys, St Bavo's and St Peter's, both founded in the seventh century. The turbulent history of this major Flemish city offers instructive examples of migration – of people and of music: a forced migration of the two abbey communities after Viking invasions to the refugee community of intellectuals in Laon led to defining changes in liturgy and music in Ghent in the tenth to twelfth centuries. In the thirteenth century, migrating clergy brought music for the local saints of Ghent to Prague and Pécs. Finally, between the late fifteenth century and 1559, the monks of St Bavo's abbey were forced to migrate to the church of St John's in Ghent, where they would constitute the chapter at St John's, now renamed and raised in status to the cathedral of St Bavo. This migration forced the monks to adapt to their new environment by renouncing their monastic liturgy and music in favor of the internationally-renowned choral polyphony of the Low Countries, which was accomplished with assistance from leading musicians, including those of Emperor Charles V. Each of these migrations, including the first and last that were forced, proved to be opportunities for enhancing the status of the migrants by different means, which included music.</Abstract>

I will discuss patrons of music (the town administration, the churches, the nobility, private individuals), composers, and surviving music.   The purpose of this lecture was to present a clear overview of what is known about music in a single European town - to be compared during the lecture to others - so that this might later be compared with what is known of the music history of Chinese towns.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Putting new media in the service of old scores, the digital environment offers much that will advance the study, teaching, and performance of music. There are on-line image archives, research databases, digital editions, tools for computational analysis, and even social media sites devoted to the serious study of music, in all its richness.  But what good are such tools? And how do they relate to the peer-reviewed journals, books, and monuments with which they jostle for attention and resources? &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; I would like to offer some perspectives on the promise and peril of the digital domain for the study of music, highlighting some current accomplishments and pointing out some challenges for the years ahead. Along the way we will pause to consider the long history of transformative intersections of music and technologies of writing and reproduction. And we will reflect on the how these new modes new tools might enable new kinds of disciplinary collaborations, new relationships among teaching and research, and new models of intellectual property and publication.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the use of ‘visual analytic' techniques to scrutinise and refine current approaches and algorithms for the identification of text reuse and alignment. In particular, we compare text alignment approaches using the ViTA (Visualization for Text Alignment) system we have developed in the context of a Digging into Data project that seeks to identify 18th-century commonplaces in large-scale historical datasets. By leveraging the flexibility of image processing techniques to visualize text alignments in a variety of ways and using multiple parameters, we can improve upon current alignment algorithms in an iterative and integrated process of automated text mining, multivariate visualization, and human-computer interaction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper describes efforts at identifying commonplaces in the Gale-Cengage Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) database. Given the size of this collection, as well as the state of the data in terms of its OCR output, identifying shared passages that exhibit the textual characteristics of commonplaces – e.g., are relatively short, repeated, and rhetorically significant – is a non-trivial computational task. In our previous work on text reuse, we came across numerous examples of textual borrowings and shared passages that we considered possible commonplaces. We expanded this work into a Digging into Data Round 3 project using similar methods to explore the more than 200,000 works contained in ECCO, a dataset that represents most of the printed literary and scientific output in Britain from 1700 to 1799.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The talk traced the ways in which the U.S., from the time of the early republic through the start of the twenty-first century did and did not authorize a "mainstream" style, arguing that for most of U.S. history (whether considering publishers, anthologies, and a range of poetic styles) there was no central authorizing agency.  Thus, the "poetry wars " of the eighties, in particular, were based on a false idea of what counted as mainstream.  As theorized -- though not always as practiced --  contemporary poetry in a variety of styles or "camps" actually shared numbers of assumptions about what poetry offers its readers or listeners.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation examines "dislocated histories" from the Canton Asylum in South Dakota, the only federal psychiatric hospital specifically created for Native peoples in the United States. Beginning with its first forced occupant in December 1902, the Asylum ultimately housed nearly 400 men, women, and children from 17 states and nearly 50 tribes before it was closed amid scandal in 1934.  My historical study draws on a vast array of source on and by the people held at the Canton Asylum, as well as oral histories and extensive collaboration with some of their descendants. Conceptualizing asylum life as community history offers a reinterpretation of conventional institutional histories, which privilege administrative perspectives. This enables new insights into human relations, constructed categories (like race and disability), and identities to emerge.&amp;#x0D;     Exploration of this Asylum community's complex history reveals "large questions in small places." Individual histories of inmates and their families are inextricably tied to broader stories of forced removals; the rise of boarding schools, as well as penal, medical, and disability institutions. This paper will focus especially on the similarities, overlaps, and distinctive differences between other institutions of control and the Canton Asylum. Including a critical assessment of disability (as a contested and culturally-specific idea, a lived experience, and an analytical interpretation), this project seeks to expand the boundaries of Native American and critical disability studies by bringing these histories into conversation with each other.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The impetus for the rise of "palatial" civilization in Crete during the Bronze Age has been a focus of discussion among Aegean and Near Eastern scholars since the first excavations of Knossos at the dawn of the twentieth century.  Arguments for indigenous evolution of the Minoan palaces or exogenous influence from the Near East have oscillated, often in concert with popular theoretical trends in archaeology.  Though much early scholarship on this debate focused on the actual construction of the palaces, in more recent years, many scholars have turned their attention away from the palaces themselves, looking instead for evidence of social ranking in the formative Prepalatial period.  Studies of Prepalatial tombs, seals, pottery, and metals suggest the presence of emergent elites in Prepalatial Crete.  My research on Near Eastern imports to Prepalatial Crete further supports this conclusion.  As many of the imports were used as bodily adornment, they were highly visible and may have played a performative role in Prepalatial society.  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In this paper, I analyze the evidence for performance spaces that may have been used by emergent elites in the Prepalatial period to display and reinforce their nascent and perhaps tenuous social power.  Notably, such spaces first appear at the same time as Eastern imports used as bodily adornment, and at the same sites where these imports are concentrated.  This suggests that Near Eastern imports may have played a prominent role in ritual performances in the formative Prepalatial period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, I analyze the artistic and archaeological evidence for ritual performance spaces in Prepalatial Crete that may have been used by emerging elites to perform their nascent and likely tenuous social identities.  Such embodied practices play a key role in communication within societies, including the creating or crossing of boundaries.  As a result of its dynamic nature, embodied performance can often create and convey meaning more effectively and powerfully than other forms of communication and, therefore, has a more powerful impact on social memory.  It is also well known, however, that rituals or embodied performances can be manipulated to conceal or exaggerate reality, and thus often speak more to identity discourse than to actual lived experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When people leave their natal countries and move to another nation, some imagine that they're just leaving for a temporary period; others plan to move permanently. No matter their circumstances and plans, all migrants bring not only suitcases but cultural "baggage" from their former homeland--systems of cultural knowledge of how the world works that, rich or poor, desperate or hopeful, all migrants bring with them on their journeys to a new world.  In this talk, I focus on cultural baggage brought by members of the new African diaspora to Europe and the U.S.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many cultural anthropologists assume that, as with spouses, we choose fieldsites for life. Yet over the past century, plenty of anthropologists have switched communities, and some now travel regularly from one fieldsite to another—sometimes pursuing diasporic communities, sometimes their own restless scholarly imaginations. Is the old-fashioned idea of committing to a single field area over the course of a career outmoded? In this paper, I explore my own struggles overcoming the One Scholar/One Fieldsite model.&amp;#x0D; After 25+ years working in and writing about a small, rural, "animist" community in the rain forest of Côte d'Ivoire, I made the difficult but enticing decision to begin research in a radically different space: the European capital city of Lisbon. This move entailed several tectonic shifts: pursuing consultants across a city of almost three million (rather than finding curious neighbors right outside my front door in a village of a few hundred); learning two languages (Portuguese, Cape Verdean Crioulo); mastering new eras (Jewish and Cape Verdean histories and diasporas); working with highly educated elites (rather than peasants trained in the oral tradition); forging relations with new colleagues (in Jewish studies, lusophone studies, migration studies, European studies); working with people along the "race" spectrum (rather than only those classified as "black"); and studying a highly mobile population spread across three continents (rather than a highly rooted community with enduring ties to place).&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In this paper, I navigate personal and professional biographies as I explore disciplinary hesitations--and pleasures—involved in taking on challenging professional transformations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past half-millenium, the people who became Cape Verdeans crossed a dizzying number of borders.  Linguistic, racial, maritime, and national borders are those most commonly known.  Yet the religious border that many Cape Verdeans crossed--from Judaism to Catholicism—may have been the most profound and transformative, while also remaining the most obscure.  In this talk, I profile the experiences of a group of contemporary Cape Verdeans living in the Boston region who are now engaged in an active dialogue with the Jewish heritage that marks their national history—and that, increasingly, many Cape Verdeans are coming to recognize marks their own familial genealogies.  The cumulative effect of nine years of what is now an annual Joint Cape Verdean-Jewish Seder held in Boston is starting to produce a broadening awareness of what was gained and lost when Cape Verdean Jews crossed the border to Christianity.  In this talk, I profile several contemporary Cape Verdeans' experiences coming to terms with this religious border crossing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From their outpost in the North Atlantic, the inhabitants of Cabo Verde's strategically located islands have looked beyond their shores ever since the uninhabited archipelago's rediscovery by European mariners in 1460. Over the past five-and-a-half centuries, the Cabo Verdean diaspora has intersected with other diasporas across Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and South Asia. This early itinerant history, while well studied in broad strokes, contains one theme just beginning to be explored by scholars: its Jewish connections. In this talk, I focus on the conjoined Jewish-Cabo Verdean diaspora, exploring how this largely unknown yet historically significant dual diaspora is now being re-evaluated among contemporary Cabo Verdeans themselves (both on and off the islands). Parallel to the efforts of many contemporary Portuguese and Brazilians, many Cabo Verdeans are now curious to chart and reclaim the somewhat submerged yet historically critical Jewish component of their island's identity. They are seeking out both their Jewish family history and their peers with Jewish ancestry. This ethnography of Cabo Verdeans with Jewish ancestry will summarize contemporary activities in which many Cabo Verdeans are now engaging in Lisbon, Praia, and New England, where they are reassessing the frequently overlooked Jewish underside to both their family histories and their national identity. The reluctance of Africanist and Jewish studies anthropologists to engage with one other will be addressed in light of the robust crossed lines of Jews and Cabo Verdeans across more than a half-millenium.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The discipline of Religious Studies tends to draw specific geographic boundaries around the past and present communities of particular religions, then investigate specific religious traditions accordingly.  Despite the more fluid nature inherent in its name, the same could be said of Diaspora Studies, which tends to focus on the major, tried-and-true diasporic trajectories, and to elide lesser-known diasporas.  Moreover, the same might equally be said of Border Studies, which—again, despite the mobility inherent in its name—tends to focus on certain kinds of borders (both geographic and conceptual) and not others.&amp;#x0D; In this talk, I aim to bring Jewish Studies and African Studies into a productive conversation with one another by engaging theoretical strains of Religious Studies, Diaspora Studies, and Border Studies that are not typically combined by scholars.  In bringing African Studies and Jewish Studies into conversation, can we ask new questions? Discover new realities?  I take up this set of comparative questions by means of a case study of Cape Verde, a place where contemporary residents both on and off the islands of this island nation are themselves crossing new conceptual boundaries as they (re)discover their Jewish ancestry and, consequently, re-imagine their identity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the contemporary era, many Cape Verdeans both on and off the islands are (re)discovering the Jewish history of their nation, their individual families, or both.  This discovery takes many forms.  Some are researching the genetic foundations of their ancestry by ordering DNA tests now readily available at a modest cost.  Others are using social media as well as online and other scholarly resources to research their Jewish history.  At an annual Passover Seder held in Boston for the past decade, some Cape Verdeans have encountered meaningful discoveries of their submerged Jewish history.  As they engage in all these pathways, many Cape Verdeans are newly learning of the Jewish foundations to daily practices deeply embedded in their lives (from food preferences to life cycle rituals).  The spectrum of engagement ranges from vague awareness of distant Jewish ancestors to full conversion to Orthodox Jewish practice.  No matter the level of engagement, as Cape Verdeans encounter the Jewish component of their genealogy, many are expanding their understanding of their identity.  In this talk, I aim to put African studies and Jewish studies into a productive conversation by asking two complementary questions.  At the macro, theoretical level, What might we learn about Cabo Verde once we acknowledge the deeply Jewish history of this island nation?  At the micro, individual level, what might we learn about contemporary Cabo Verdeans' own complex and expanding understandings of self as we explore their process of (re)discovering new components of family history and identity?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Cape Verde islands represent a uniquely riveting space from which to explore religious border crossings.  Empty of all human habitation at the time of Portuguese discovery of the archipelago, the islands soon became populated by a blend of people from Catholic, Jewish, and indigenous African religious traditions, where, arguably, the world's first "creolized" population was created.  Many Cabo Verdeans are increasingly curious to chart and reclaim the somewhat submerged yet historically critical Jewish component of their island's identity--seeking out both their Jewish family history and their peers with Jewish ancestry.  In this talk, I explore a selection of their stories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since its incorporation into the expanding Portuguese empire some 550 years ago, the West African archipelago of Cape Verde has imagined itself as Catholic.  Yet that hegemonic discourse conceals an important subaltern narrative.  Starting with the first years of habitation on these remote islands during the 1460s, Jews arrived in significant numbers.  Their motive?  They fled anti-Semitism first in Portugal and Spain (from the 1492/1496 Edicts of Expulsion and the ensuing Inquisition), and later in Morocco.  The Catholic Church and its legal apparatus immediately suppressed their religion, and they and their descendants married local residents steeped in Catholic as well as local ("animist") traditions.  Yet in habitus both conscious and unconscious, their descendants embodied many Jewish practices of their ancestors.  These habits and rituals range from dietary and culinary preferences, to life cycle events, to values concerning education and time.  Often taking these mysterious practices as a starting point, many contemporary Cape Verdeans across Europe and the US are (re)discovering the Jewish history of their nation and their individual families.  What does it mean—both at the individual level and at the level of the nation--to refamiliarize oneself with a religious tradition that, until recently, appeared strange, yet was intimately familiar to one's ancestors?  Exploring the intriguing case of a religion that has moved from the familiar to the strange and back to the familiar across the span of a half-millenium, this paper analyzes both breaches and bonds in the current moment of a centuries-long, dual diaspora.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Soon after Portugal claimed Cape Verde for their growing empire in the mid-15th century, some Jews fleeing growing anti-Semitism in Spain and Portugal found their way to the islands.  There they joined European Catholics and African animists--forging the first multi-faith, "creole" population of the modern world.  In this talk, I explore the implications of this half-millenium of Jewish influence for contemporary Cape Verdeans in New England.  How do Cape Verdean-Americans with Jewish ancestry understand and negotiate their remarkably mixed religious heritage?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For decades, and in some cases centuries, Cape Verdeans suppressed discussion or even knowledge of their Jewish ancestry, often in order to avoid anti-Semitism.  For a variety of reasons, in recent years many Cape Verdeans (both on and off the islands) have begun exploring their (individual and collective) Jewish heritage and developing a variety of ways to revisit their spiritually mixed identities.  In this talk, I explore these links.  I base my remarks on fieldwork (both formal interviews and informal participant-observation) conducted in Portugal, Cape Verde, and the U.S.  Using this comparative research as a backdrop, I focus on a single ritual event: a Passover Seder held in Boston, and produced jointly for Jewish Americans, and Cape Verdeans with a spectrum of religious backgrounds.  I suggest that this annual occasion (which has just enjoyed its eleventh celebration) highlights the 550+-year-long conversation that Cape Verdeans and Jews have held since the mid-15th century, and that they are now reviving and reconfiguring in the contemporary era.  Drawing at theoretical levels from three decades of prior research on religion in rural, francophone West Africa (among the Beng people of Côte d'Ivoire), I approach the ritual event of the Passover Seder in Boston as an occasion allowing Cape Verdeans to variously reinforce, re-evaluate, and reconfigure their identity through personal interaction, textual reinterpretation, and symbolic performance.  More broadly, combining theoretical perspectives from diaspora studies/hybridity theory on the one hand, and ritual studies/performance theory on the other hand, I argue that the notion of "African Jewry" is one whose scholarly time has come.  In the context of contemporary challenges posed by migration, processes of Creolization, and the quest for racial justice, does this new attempt to combat earlier anti-Semitism, which is often embedded in internalized identities, have a space for joining the conversation?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper offers an analysis of Violeta Parra's first solo album, "Violeta Parra, la voz de los campos chilenos" (Odeón Chilena, 1955). The record represents the pivotal moment in Parra's life as she left behind a promising and decades-long career as a performer of música popular to pursue her newfound vocation of folklorist. Beyond capturing the musician in her personal moment of transition, the album illustrates key and diverse aspects of the cosmopolitan musical scene of the 1950s. It includes two traditional songs Parra collected as a folklorist, elaborately arranged with Parra on vocals accompanied by a small ensemble of studio musicians. It also features Parra's original composition "Casamiento de negros," which would be picked up and recorded the next year by the U.S. musician and composer Les Baxter, pioneer of the exotica movement of the 1950s and early 1960s. Finally, it includes Parra's hit, "Que pena siente el alma," which would be included on an international demo album for television and radio put out by Capitol Records in 1956. The multi-directionality of Parra's first solo album underscores the ill-defined and transitory cultural moment in which it was produced. It reached "back" to the "root" music of the Chilean countryside even as it adapted the traditional cantos to modern musical styles. It was the first release in Odeón Chilena's series, "cantos de Chile" and thus a nationalist project, yet it provided Parra with her first exposure to an international audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The impact of Surrealism on twentieth century interior design, at least in its most spectacular manifestations, has been thoroughly explored by scholars, including Beatriz Colomina and Anthony Vidler, and the subject was included in a 2007 exhibition at the V&amp;amp;A titled "Surreal Things: Surrealism and Design." Such masterpieces of the irrational as Le Corbusier's de Beistegui Apartment in Paris of 1929, Salvador Dali's fantastical&amp;#x0D; furnishings inspired by Mae West, or Frederick Kiesler's Art of this Century Gallery, 1942, in New York, have received considerable attention. However, the Surrealist urge toward the irrational and the challenge to the "functional" in interior design lurks in less well-known examples, manifesting itself in interiors as diverse as Andy Warhol's aluminum foil-clad Factory of the 1960s and the 1980s postmodern masterpieces of the Italian group Memphis. Even the work of such canonical "high" modern architects as Mies van der Rohe, as Rosemarie Bletter has shown, exhibit irrational tendencies, and this session encourages proposals that continue this investigation, venturing inside less well scrutinized examples to consider surrealist gestures and material transformations in interior design.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In July 2015, the National Endowment for the Humanities sponsored a Summer Institute at Drexel University under the direction of David Raizman, PhD, Distinguished University Professor, Art &amp;amp; Art History and Project Faculty Carma Gorman, PhD, Assoc. Professor and Ass't Chair, Department of Art &amp;amp; Art History, University of Texas. This month of intensive study moved "beyond the canon of Modern design" to a deeper understanding of what might have been considered secondary or even peripheral research material just a generation ago. Twenty-five scholars and practitioners ranging in age from their late 20s to their early 60s formed teams for presentations during the Institute's final week. Along the way, visits to the storage areas of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, time at the Hagley Museum and Library examining materials relating to the institution of a "color system" with the arrival of synthetic dyestuffs with Dr. Regina Blaszczyk, and sessions with curator Clare Sauro at Drexel's Fox Historic Costume Collection amplified the content of classroom lectures.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This session would bring participants from the  Summer Institute together with other teachers to communicate the strengths and challenges of the approaches they were exposed to in 2015. How can we best cope with a growing need for involvement with primary materials in a digital age as part of a design education and our need as researchers to responsibly preserve rare items for future scholars?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The NWP interview with Kwame Alexander is highlighted in context of scholarship and research that led to the yearlong professional development design. Teachers at Hill Central used Alexander's The Crossover (2014) and Acoustic Rooster and His Barnyard Band (2011) to enhance a community of writing that challenged dominant framings of urban youth as non-writers (Fisher, 2005; Haddix, 2009; Mahiri &amp;amp; Sablo, 1996). Alexander's children's book and young adult text were emphasized during professional development to explore language and student identities (Hadaway, Young, &amp;amp; Ward, 2012). Support was provided through the U.S. Department of Education's Title II program and a National Writing Project (NWP) Supporting Effective Educator Development in a High - Need School grant.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My presentation concerns the causal theories of Ibn Sina and al-Ghazali. It is widely held that Ibn Sina believed in (and argued for) the necessity of natural causality, and that al-Ghazali rejected this causal necessity but allowed for the existence of natural causality. I argued that, contrary to this received view, al-Ghazali accepted Ibn Sina's argument for causal necessity, and accordingly rejected completely natural causality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper re-examines at the editorial dilemma presented by the divergent translation of Book III, Chapters 14-18 in one branch of the OEHE manuscripts as a question of source. This dilemma is compounded by other readings shared across branches, and complicated by the survival of chapter headings written to fit one branch in a manuscript of the other branch. None of these problems are new, but they are problems that seem to arise from the fact that the HE and its vernacular counterpart circulated together in Anglo-Saxon England. If it is too circular to say that a palimpsest in Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 10 used the OEHE as a source for itself, it may be safe to say that the OEHE provides one of the clearest surviving examples of a text that was revised and restored (variably) by reference to both itself and its Latin source. I am in the process of editing the OEHE Book III.14-18, and hope to shed new light on the question of the divergence because I have access to materials unknown to Thomas Miller, the last editor of the OEHE. These are: Lawrence Nowell's transcription of the burned Cotton MS and John Smith's collation of that MS in a copy of Wheloc's 1644 edition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jazz is a fascinating study of multiple binary systems: high/low; black/white; popular entertainment/historical artifact. Today, jazz supported with funding and celebrated as an important authentic American art form. Founded in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts did not initially recognize jazz; in 72 years, the Pulitzer Prize for music has only been awarded to one jazz composition (1997). The "American-ness" of jazz comes through an amalgamation of folk and roots musics, but became a cultural juggernaut, cutting race, gender, and class, through the recording and film industries, the dance craze, and its core ideologies of hope and rebellion. Following the War of 1812, Americans wanted art forms that would assert our nation's cultural independence; but by the Jazz Age, "culture" was associated with upper class refinement and drawing boundaries. Duke Ellington, arguably one of the most important composers of the 20th century, defied musical categorization and transcended boundaries. He wrote the song that names the Swing era, as well as long-form pieces that tell the history of Black people in America. Through his music, Ellington provides a lens by which to examine the spectrums, gradations, multiplicity, and mixture of what we call American culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Part of a panel on "Re-Evaluating Southern Liberalism," this paper examines Jonathan Daniels's 1938 book A Southerner Discovers the South  not only for its role in his own evolution as a liberal, but also for its impact on the American political scene. As a bestseller that appeared within days of President Franklin Roosevelt's statement that the South was "the Nation's No. 1 economic problem," Daniels's book and the "regionalist liberal" perspective it embodied were more provocative and influential than historians have recognized.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jonathan Daniels's 1937 interview with Birmingham industrialist Charles F. DeBardeleben, president of the Alabama Fuel and Iron Company, provides a window onto the labor conflicts in Depression-era Birmingham. Daniels considered DeBardeleben an old-time paternalist but also noted his political allegiance to Republican candidate Alf Landon in 1936. Focusing on DeBardeleben thus helps us understand connections between the history of labor relations in the South and the full-scale political realignment among white southerners that would be evident by the 1960s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With Cavafy's manuscript "self-comments" as its focus, the paper deals with the poet as commentator of his own work as well as with the editorial and philological issues that arise when editing the specific texts. The aim of the editor's commentary is to provide the fullest possible understanding and appreciation of an idiosyncratic and demanding corpus of archival material. Cavafy's "self-comment" on the poem "The Retinue of Dionysus" is discussed as an example.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presentation was part of a panel titled, "New Digital Methodologies in the Study of the Colonial World", given during the Latin American Studies Association conference. The presentation discussed ongoing work to transform the "unreadable" Spanish colonial archive into an accessible one using Transkribus, a platform that uses Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technology to automate the transcription of manuscript documents. Currently, the tool publicly provides pre-trained HTR models for 18th and 19th-century variants of English, Dutch, German, and French, but no models in 16th and 17th-century Spanish. Addressing this significant gap, the LLILAS Benson Digital Scholarship Office is training HTR models on four common early-modern Spanish calligraphic styles: escritura procesal, humanística cursiva, procesal-cortesana, and procesal-encadenada. Our goals are trifold: we hope to expedite the transcription of our digitized holdings of Spanish colonial materials, address the linguistic gap in HTR technologies, and share out the workflows and models we create to the broader scholarly and archival community.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation highlights the publishing partnership between Sounding Spirit and the University of North Carolina Press that is producing five annotated facsimile editions that hope to illustrate the significance of texts and textual communities to American music history and practice. Co-facilitated by Sounding Spirit managing editor Meredith Doster and UNC Press Wyndham Robertson Editorial Director Mark Simpson-Vos, this session explores the challenges of translating the established, print-heavy genre of scholarly editions into a digital born environment. In a conversation that critically examines the genre of the scholarly edition, Doster and Simpson-Vos will raise and respond to these questions: What is the purpose of reproducing the bibliographic history of a text or series of texts? What is the value of tracing variants across issues and editions? How and why might that work matter today? And how might this genre need to continue evolving to matter more?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Medicolegal expertise attracted scrutiny and calls for reform, as its influence in both French courts and culture grew during the nineteenth century. Leading figures in the field were the most vocal proponents of reform. Their critiques crystallized around a number of key issues concerning systemic shortcomings as well as incompetence among some medical experts. While demanding sweeping reform, a number of commentators lamented that deficiencies in medicolegal expertise were responsible for wrongful convictions and for undermining the field of forensic medicine itself.   This paper examines the tensions between confidence and uncertainty in the field of forensic medicine as well as the outcry over insufficiently trained and incompetent practitioners who carried out forensic expertise that exceeded the limits of their knowledge and skills. Serious concerns about medical practitioners' erroneous findings came to the fore in a number of criminal proceedings, including cases of suspected infanticide, poisoning, and suspicious death. Flawed autopsy reports were a lightning rod for criticism. Some doctors demonstrated discomfort or a lack of confidence in distinguishing between various manners and causes of death and carrying out forensic expertise that exceeded the limits of their knowledge or training. For example, a doctor testifying before the assize court of the Seine-Inférieure in 1855 about the inconsistencies in his autopsy reports explained that he had studied forensic medicine only briefly twenty years ago and was "very ignorant" about its practices. Nonetheless, forensic doctors advanced a narrative of progress that emphasized the triumph of science and justice, despite the considerable challenges that practitioners of forensic medicine confronted in death investigations during this period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"From Greek dances on ancient vases, then suddenly to Chopin? How could she have come to this?" Thus began a 1903 review of Isadora Duncan's new Chopin program by Austrian playwright, critic, and figurehead of the Vienna Secession, Hermann Bahr. This reflection was just one of many as Bahr chronicled Duncan's turn from pictorial to musical inspiration. His reviews of Duncan in the Neues Wiener Tagblatt, along with transcripts of their conversations in his sketchbooks and diaries, richly detail Duncan's early struggle to create of an abstract line in movement that could rival the directness of musical expression. Two private performances in Vienna in Feb., 1902 sparked Bahr's interest in Duncan's endeavor to dance an "exact, scientific line" in her pictorial evocations of Greek art. The Chopin program she presented to the Viennese public in March, 1903 thus caught Bahr off guard, causing him to reflect on the impetus for Duncan's new approach. In this presentation, I consider Bahr's attempt to capture the trajectory of Duncan's development from pictorial to musical inspiration and further to explain this development to a Viennese public at once skeptical and fascinated with Duncan's modern experiment. Duncan notoriously moved on from Chopin to Beethoven in Feb., 1904. Yet the initial turn to music as her primary material is still not well understood. This talk will focus on Bahr's record of her early struggle to emulate musical line and the multiple modes of resistance she faced in this pioneering work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>U.S. dancer Isadora Duncan (1877–1927) achieved her first public acclaim in Germany in 1903, setting off a storm of public debate over the virtues of her bared feet and legs. Yet the path for the widely circulated images of her exposed natural body in the German popular press had been prepared by a popular youth artist known as Fidus (1868–1948), whose drawings of chastely dancing nudes illustrated many German youth magazines and by 1903 "hung in almost every German apartment."  Also responsible for the frontispiece drawing of Duncan published in her 1903 manifesto, The Dance of the Future, Fidus was an ardent admirer of Duncan's dancing. Many German commentators noted a connection between Fidus and Duncan's visual aesthetics and, more importantly, the political implications for their shared visions of physical health and beauty.  In this presentation, I consider couplings of Fidus and Duncan as like-minded prophets by German critics within the pre-war German body culture (Körperkultur) movement. While in 1903 Duncan had declared herself a Darwinist, she could not have foreseen the program of race regeneration the body culture movement eventually served. Fidus, however, became a zealous National Socialist and eventually dedicated his "temple art" to the promotion of Nazi ideology. Drawing on writings by Fidus and proponents of Körperkultur, I present the relationship between Duncan and Fidus as but one in a complex of threads connecting Duncan's choreographic display of the strong, healthy, liberated body to the ideals of race purity and eugenics promoted by many of her German admirers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this interview, Sarah Whitcher Kansa, Executive Editor of Open Context, discusses the development of Open Context and aspects of its approach to data publishing. Open Context's granular approach to data means that each item resolves to its own unique URL and is linkable to related data from across the Web. This "one URL per pot sherd" facilitates research by allowing people to cite specific items in a database and recognizes the individual contributions of authors who described or analyzed specific items. Recognizing there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to data archiving and dissemination in archaeology, Open Context has taken a bottom-up approach, developing new functionality to meet the demands of data authors over time. Open Context's team works with data authors to clean and decode their data and add descriptive information about the intellectual context of the data creation. This additional work, along with annotating datasets to facilitate linked open data, ensures that data are more intelligible and useful to future users. Kansa also discusses the importance of supporting innovation and exploration in the growing ecosystem of data sharing and archiving, highlighting how the success of related programs benefit Open Context. She concludes by discussing the benefits of broadening the community of people who engage with datasets through improved data literacy and storytelling.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2016, the University of Florida (UF) established an international partnership with the Centro de Documentación e Investigación Judío de México (CDIJUM) in order to engage in joint digital projects. CDIJUM was first established as the Centro de Documentación e Investigación de la Comunidad Ashkenazí (CDICA) in 1990 with a mission to rescue, preserve and provide access to the documents, archives, and books that used to be in the building of the Ashkenazi community. The 1985 earthquake in Mexico City compromised the building, and its holdings were scattered across different store houses of the community. Access was restored in 1993, and in 2009, the center's holdings were declared a World Heritage collection by UNESCO. On March 9, 2015, the CDICA expanded its mission to hold and preserve the cultural heritage of all the Jewish communities in Mexico, and it changed its name to reflect this broader vision. The new partnership with the UF Libraries (specifically, the Latin American and Caribbean Collection, the Judaica Library and the Digital Library of the Caribbean) began with the digitization of the complete run of the long-running Spanish-language Jewish newspaper, Kesher. Other scarce Mexican Jewish periodicals were also identified for future iterations of the project. However, the devastating earthquake in Mexico City in 2017 has further highlighted the vital need for such projects. Thankfully, the newspapers had all been taken off site for digitization, but meanwhile the CDIJUM building suffered irreparable damage and their precious archives had to be transferred to temporary storage while a new building is constructed. This paper will describe the above collaborative project and why it is critical to preserve these newspapers and documents.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The impetus for the international symposium on which this volume is based stems from "The Badakhshan Genealogical Project," a collaborative project I directed with Daniel Beben and Umed Mamadsherzodshoev with the support of a 3-year National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Collaborative Research Grant. The NEH project was comprised of two parts: the creation of an open access digital repository in the Princeton University Library and a publication of m forthcoming co-authored book with Daniel Beben and Umed Mamadsherzodshoev, titled Ismailism in Badakhshan: A Genealogical History. The goal of the project was to render a corpus of Persian-language (often with Arabic features) genealogical texts, dating from the 15th to the 20th century, legible as historical sources by digitalizing them, identifying their features, defining local genres of genealogy as historical practices, and analyzing them as a source for local, regional, and transregional knowledge of the Isma?ili tradition of Badakhshan and the wider Pamir. Some 65 genealogical texts were located and digitally photographed by me during field research I conducted between 2004-2019 in the towns and villages across the regions of Badakhshan in Tajikistan. This talk will explore how a project I initially conceptualized as one focused on shrine culture evolved into a long-term collaborative project focused on genealogical documentary practice in Afghan and Tajik Badakhshan as a local, archival, familial "site of knowledge production," to use the words of Ann Laura Stoler (2002) and resulted in the construction of an institutional digital archive in Princeton University Library's Digital Repository that preserves these texts as a new public, global, "site of knowledge production." It will explore how, In the course of visiting shrines, photographing shrinescapes, and interviewing community elders, I became aware of a pronounced "nasab-mindedness (to borrow from Hodgson).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Note: Actual proposal PDF is included in the Supplementary Materials section. No URL available.  Proposal Name: Multimodal Text Sets of the Untold and Silenced Stories in our Communities  A proposal to the November 2022 National Council of Teachers of English Annual Convention was submitted by the co-directors, planning and teaching team, and 11 of the participants to share about the NEH institute and products from the project. If accepted, the presentation will include a panel discussion about the framework and focus of the NEH institute, a gallery walk among poster displays set up by teacher participants to share their multimodal text sets and the ways these text sets are being used in classrooms, and a panel discussion about strategies for researching multimodal text sets to uncover stories. The goal of this presentation is to inspire educators to engage in these practices in their own contexts and provide practical examples of text set implementation along with humanities research strategies. This event would give participants of our project the opportunity to extend their professional development, presenting to a national audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our presentation will address the recovery, mission, materials, and methods for our growing digital archive of the letters of Catharine Maria Sedgwick, to be published through the Massachusetts Historical Society's new Primary Source Cooperative (MHS PSC). A National Endowment for the Humanities Scholarly Edition and Translations Grant has enabled us to launch our work, and an Andrew Mellon/National Historical Records and Publication Commission grant awarded to the MHS is helping us develop editing processes, tools, and ultimately a platform that will become open source materials for future editors and publishers of digital editions. A glimpse of our behind-the-scenes editorial materials and workflow will provide context for an illustrated case study, aimed to orient others interested in archival digital editing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After giving a brief overview and history of the Catharine Maria Sedgwick Online Letters (CMSOL) NEH-funded project, I will discuss the challenges and value of creating personal references (pers refs) for a digital publication. In Sedgwick's case, challenges include her very large family -- over 100 individuals when we include first cousins -- many of whom were active parts of Sedgwick's life and some of whom share names (e.g., there are three "Catharines" just among Sedgwick's nieces). Sedgwick also abbreviated names, e.g., Mrs. C or Captain W, and identifying these vague references can take extensive cross-referencing and may ultimately prove impossible. In terms of value, as part of the Massachusetts Historical Society's Primary Source Cooperative project, we commit to provide precise information about all persons mentioned in Sedgwick's letters. The intent is to build new knowledge by adding to existing resources such as the Library of Congress Name Authority (LCNA) and Social Network and Archival Contexts (SNAC) records. Where such identifications do not already exist -- as is common for less well-known men and most women and persons of color -- we work to find sources that provide accurate information, thus building out and democratizing these resources. I will share our prosopography data sheets and our self-created family "tree."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Each letter in the CMSOL edition will make new knowledge possible, and each will be made more accessible to readers in several key ways. Not only will the letters be typed and the people mentioned within them identified to the best of our ability, they will also be tagged with subject headings, and illuminated with explanatory notes. Both of these steps require editorial team-effort to generate, and both require agreement and collaboration to complete. What information would be helpful? How much is too much, and distracting? Subject headings, in particular, are taking us into new territory. What search terms will be most helpful to future users of our archive? For instance, while developing our CMSOL Subject list we realized that we did not want to use the phrase "Separate Spheres" as a subject--a term being used by one of the other founding editions in the PSC--preferring instead the phrase "Gender Roles." And if we included "motherhood" on our list, we also wanted to add "fatherhood" and "childcare," especially since Sedgwick frequently took care of her nieces and nephews but was never a mother herself. How do we account for the fact that we have not yet read every letter, and in the future may not have the exact subject headings we need? Given that we cannot predict every subject, we are attempting to identify terms that future searchers will be able to combine, such as Health/Illness, Domestic Duties, and Gender Roles, in order to surface letters about Sedgwick's role as a visiting nurse for family members, or Legal Issues and Marriage/Marital Relations to find letters that address women's property rights. My portion of the roundtable will provide examples and raise issues and questions to consider in making these kinds of editorial judgments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Each letter in the CMSOL digital edition begins with a hand-written manuscript, which must be converted into a typed transcription. Though the project editors review and verify this work, students can be the first to view, format, and initiate encoding of original manuscripts. During my portion of the roundtable, I will address students' experiences of transcribing and editing letters for the CMSOL digital edition. Students in my Master's-level Introduction to Digital Humanities course acquired hands-on experience with an ongoing DH project by transcribing Sedgwick's letters for the CMSOL collection  and found it to be a frustrating but rewarding experience. Sedgwick, like other 19th-century writers, often fills every available space in her letters, finishing a sentence from the fourth page, for instance, by writing sideways in the margin on the first page, or writing over the previous text. For students who rarely read non-typewritten documents (and may not have learned cursive themselves), deciphering her handwriting was a challenge, and the wealth of personal references (discussed in Kalayjian's paper for this roundtable) only complicated matters. Nevertheless, students reported that generating Initial Transcriptions was fascinating and even fun. In this paper I will discuss my students' experience of transcribing Sedgwick's letters and share images of original manuscripts, the Initial Transcription template, the CMSOL Transcription Guidelines, and sample student transcriptions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In his essay "The Ends of Editing," Peter M.W. Robinson compares scholarly editing to citizenship: "Being a good textual editor is not so different from being a good citizen: one ought to listen, ought to try to understand what is actually being said, then ought to try to help others understand too." (DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly Vol. 3, No. 3, 2009.) This, in a nutshell, characterizes the editorial ethos of the CMSOL project. In my brief remarks for this roundtable, I will explain what this process and conversation comprises, what some of the challenges of listening, understanding and helping others to understand have been, and what our practices for transforming this conversation from Word into XML have entailed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Each letter in the CMSOL digital edition begins with a hand-written manuscript, which must be converted into a typed transcription. My introduction to documentary editing began with this task, one of several I was assigned as a (paid) graduate research assistant. Though the project editors review and verify my work, I am the first person to view, format, and initiate encoding of the original manuscript. Sedgwick, like other 19th-century writers, often fills every available space in her letters, finishing a sentence from the fourth page, for instance, by writing sideways in the margin on the first page, or writing over the previous text. And her handwriting can be very challenging to decipher, even when it is not cross-written. That said, generating Initial Transcriptions turns out to be both fascinating and frustrating, but ultimately very satisfying work. During my portion of the roundtable I will provide a glimpse of the joys and challenges of transcribing, sharing images of original manuscript as well as materials such as our Handwriting Guide for Sedgwick's script, our Initial Transcription Template, and the Transcription Guidelines used during this process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bryant identified Redwood as the "first American novel, strictly speaking." And he considered the novel an "hazardous experiment" because it focused on contemporary society. Twenty-first-century critics have claimed that Redwood is Sedgwick's "second best novel" (Fetterley), and possibly the first to challenge slavery twenty-five years before Uncle Tom's Cabin (Karcher). While not an epistolary novel, interpolated letters by multiple characters are vital in forwarding the novel's action and providing the reader with diverse perspectives. This essay argues that Sedgwick's epistolary interludes function as models of the kinds of introspection and questioning that would serve her readers as they navigate their own roles and responsibilities in civic and spiritual life, and they demonstrate the efficacy of letter writing itself as an agent of change. In addition to examining how the cultural work of the novel is advanced through its letters (particularly related to developing religious tolerance and increasing female agency) I will introduces several private, unpublished letters by early readers of the novel that not only shed light on 19th-century responses but also illuminate Sedgwick's historical influences and writing processes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Oggi presenteremo i risultati preliminari del nostro progetto di ricognizione archeologica nella zona costiera delimitata partendo dal sud di Marsala fino alla periferia nord di Mazara del Vallo  e delimitata a est dalla Strado Statale 115 (come evidenziato nella slide).  Questo comprensorio naturale e antropico si estende per circa 44 km2. La ricognizione di tale settore tenta di rispondere a determinati problemi storici e di insediamento sul lungo periodo nella provincia di Trapani, soprattutto considerando l'impatto economico e culturale del canale di Sicilia sugli abitanti rurali della zona.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In her second novel Redwood (1824), Catharine Maria Sedgwick interpolates 24 letters and notes by 15 different characters within the book's 27 chapters. These letters are situated in 8 scenes of letter writing (in which a character is actually writing a letter) and 19 scenes of letter reading. Sedgwick's privileging of these epistolary elements, which include her bookending of the volume with long missives penned by two individuals who are opposites in many ways--Henry Redwood, the eponymous hero, a twice-widowed, wealthy Southerner, and Deborah Lenox, a never-married Vermont farmwoman--demands further consideration. As Caroline Karcher has noted, Sedgwick's narrative experiment in Redwood to "share authorship with her characters by letting them narrate parts of the story through interpolated letters . . . allows [her] to present multiple perspectives on events and to give voice even to marginal or evil characters" (10). But in her brief essay aimed at repositioning Sedgwick in American literary history, Karcher did not delve into particulars.  This essay builds on and interrogates Karcher's observation, considering how Sedgwick's epistolary experiments make the novel a bridging text between the completely epistolary novels of the eighteenth century and works published after hers, and examines how her interpolated letters function as models of the kinds of introspection and questioning that could serve her readers as they navigated their own roles and responsibilities in civic and spiritual life. How does Sedgwick use letters to give voice to the voiceless (particularly female characters)? How is the cultural work of the novel advanced through its letters? How might Sedgwick's use of letters demonstrate the efficacy of letter writing itself as an agent of change? This essay will address these questions and others, and likely integrate several letters by Sedgwick and others that shed light on 19th-century responses to the novel and illuminate some of Sedgwick's histo</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2021, teachers from more than thirty states attended Voices of the Ancients: Archaeology and Oral Tradition in the American Southwest, an institute funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The institute, planned for the summer of 2020, was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Seventy-one teachers attended one of two week-long institutes at Southern Utah University (SUU) in June and July respectively. While project personnel were successful in conducting both sessions in person, SUU required alternate plans for instruction and a rise in Covid cases would have forced cancelation of in-person sessions or major revisions to the schedule and venues. Taught by a team of educators, archaeologists, and Native American elders, the teachers experienced Project Archaeology curricula highlighting Fremont archaeological sites. They engaged with important landmarks of Fremont history and culture including the Parowan Gap Petroglyphs, Paragonah Mounds, and Fremont Indian State Park. Speakers from local tribes provided important insights into ancestral connections to the landscape and contemporary issues of cultural heritage preservation. Initial analysis of learning outcomes indicates that the participants valued their experience, learned the basics of Fremont archaeology, and understood the importance of including Native voices in the narrative of American history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>he Universal Dependencies project, which provides morphosyntactically analyzed data in over 100 languages, offers homogeneous annotation schemes and workflows for both Big Data languages such as English, and Low Resource languages often at the heart of Digital Humanities work. In this talk I will present work on a language from the latter group: Coptic, the language of 1st millennium Egypt. Thanks to progress in NLP technologies and the development of UD annotated data, our project, Coptic Scriptorium (https://copticscriptorium.org/) has been able to create fully automatic tools for analyzing Coptic data, including morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, parsing and entity recognition. These analyses feed a suite of tools enabling Named Entity Linking to open data such as Wikipedia, as well as automatic generation of lexicographic examples and entity-type based Word Sense Disambiguation in an online dictionary. This work shows that a variety of technologies often assumed to be relevant mainly for Big Data languages, such as Deep Learning, Transformers (BERT) and more, can work well when even modest amounts of richly annotated UD data are available for bootstrapping.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract: In this paper we argue that both klezmer music and the Yiddish language are not simply historical artifacts, but the loci of thriving contemporary interest communities and that creating digital structures tailored to the needs of these communities is a clear imperative that matches the need to design for academic best practice in the digital humanities space. The Klezmer Archive Project and the Kiselgof-Makonovetsky Digital Manuscript Project (KMDMP) present a unique opportunity to create digital spaces that support culture bearers, and to develop high-quality, authoritative resources for newcomers to the field. Both of these projects have been the unlikely beneficiaries of Coronavirus-related lockdowns in unexpected ways. The Klezmer Archive functions as a distributed team, and much of the communal work, exchange, learning, and events in the KMDMP take place in zoom rooms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Documentation of music based in oral tradition is inherently complicated: unknown composers, inconsistent names, multiple versions, and overlapping genres stretch the limits of archival taxonomies. To address these issues, the Klezmer Archive Project is investigating ways to structure corpus-specific metadata and to build tools for curated user contributions within a flexible architecture, showing relationships between items, linking multiple recordings, tune variations, and shared melodic material and any other user-identified relationship artifact-to-artifact.   This presentation will relay the project team's findings in its first year of work, including UX research with community members, music encoding considerations in the case study materials, and further thoughts on corpus-specific metadata ontologies for music based in oral tradition.</Abstract>

It is not an archive, as such, but a collection of hundreds of thousands of data points lifted from archival material. The result is a different image of Asia than is glimpsed through letters and journals. Instead it is an aggregate picture of what place Christianity held in Chinese society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digital scholarship provides new possibilities for examining the past. This paper explores how the China Historical Christian Database is trying to revisit the history of Christianity in China through geographic and social network maps, and how that can shed new light on important questions such as modernization, the evolution of science, religious change, and Sino-Western relations. However, digital tools can also flatten out history, reducing the complex lives of people to 1s or 0s. In a Digital Humanities project, how can computers enhance and enrich our understanding of human lives, rather than reduce or diminish them?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The panel seeks to explore the innovative ways in which librarians have engaged with digital primary sources through innovations in teaching, research, and how their work has made these materials accessible to the broader academic community during the pandemic. Christine Hernández and Gabrielle Vail will speak their NEH/Unicode funded project to digitize Maya rubbings that will form part of an online repository where scholars can identify, transcribe, and translate Maya hieroglyphic texts; Patricia Figueroa and Heather Cole will give a short presentation on their findings as part of the Ithaka S + R Report and its application in teaching with primary sources; and Rachel Stein will present how she turned in-person instruction into an online activity using LibGuides.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Starting in the year 1870 a new type of public recreation space called "people's garden" or millet bahçesi started to take root in the Ottoman Empire's urban centers, from the Balkans to North Africa. These formally landscaped spaces took as their inspiration the Haussmann-era Parisian promenades designed in the "English style." Proponents of the recreation movement in Europe advocated for the establishment of public parks to give residents of industrializing cities a respite from pollution and overcrowded slums. Calls for the necessity of new public gardens were concurrently being voiced by Ottoman municipal leaders as well as members of Ottoman civic society. Unlike the sprawling Bois de Boulogne or Bois de Vincennes, however, Istanbul's new parks occupied a much smaller footprint, especially in relation to the city's plentiful meadows or river banks that were already in use as popular sites of recreation. Ottoman government documents, newspaper articles, and personal memoirs provide documentation of the belief that these new public gardens would promote better public health and hygiene. Yet the establishment of these public gardens were less about giving urban residents much needed access to outdoor recreation and fresh air than about serving as symbols of Istanbul's modern urban transformation. This paper looks at textual and visual documentation of some of first public gardens built in key Ottoman cities in 1870, and contrasts them to longstanding Ottoman public recreation spaces and their aesthetic lineage. Studying Ottoman urban renewal in the late nineteenth century raises questions about public access, civic engagement, and the health of growing cities and their publics that are still relevant for urban centers caught in the grip of neoliberal transformation today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Inequality, food choice and sustainability are inextricably linked because choice is based on power, and people without power have fewer opportunities to make healthy and sustainable food choices. This is evident in a diverse state like Florida where nearly one out of four minority residents live below the poverty line, and minority residents are nearly twice as likely to die from chronic diet-related illness than white residents. The Florida Heritage Foods Project at (presenters' home institution) is a student-centered, project-based learning initiative that aims to increase access to fresh and local food for low-income residents by linking local food to local culture. Heritage food lessons in humanities courses guide students toward generating public education materials that 1) provide information on the nutritional and cultural value of specific nutrient-dense crops that are easy and inexpensive to grow in a Florida home garden, and 2) provide quick and easy recipes to promote the consumption of healthier foods. Student-generated artifacts have been adopted by (a local university's) Health Street program, which aims to reduce disparities in healthcare, and by (a local county) K12 Farm-to-School program. By connecting the classroom to public service, instructional artifacts in the Florida Heritage Foods Project empower students to take a proactive role in promoting more sustainable and just food systems in their community. This joint presentation by two faculty members representing different disciplines will provide concrete ideas for teaching environmental ethics that pertain particularly to the topics of food security, community engagement, and justice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Defoe's Journal of the Plague Year famously incorporates tables of rates of infection and numbers of deaths alongside first-person and second-hand reports of the 1665 plague in London. "The surprise ‘must-read' for people facing the Covid-19 epidemic" (The Telegraph), myriad courses in Health Humanities have embraced Defoe's work of creative nonfiction for teaching during a global contagion. The work itself fronts a kind of contagion of numbers and emotional outbursts that pit themselves against each other prefiguring the "two cultures" debates that our students inherit.   I'll be teaching this work for the first time in an introductory and interdisciplinary co-taught course "Health, Culture, and Societies: Interdisciplinary Explorations" in fall 2022 alongside a Medical Anthropologist and an Epidemiologist, partnering with our local Multicultural Health Institute. My plan is to ask students to focus on specific tables Defoe gives that track deaths, illnesses, and burials in different parts of London in tandem with specific moments of highly emotional content. Together we'll seek to articulate the kinds of knowledge these different approaches offer—one an example of early statistics, and the other more narrative and affective.   The Executive Director of the Multicultural Health Institute, herself a medical doctor, argues for getting students into the community, assisting in blood-pressure measurements, distributing health information, and listening to peoples' health concerns. She's been frank about seeing real people and hearing their everyday stories, rather than "all this theory and reading" and runs a Tuesday evening community update focused on transmission rates and demographics. By engaging with Defoe's apparently distant text, which invites us to ask what we really know from quantitative rates and narrative accounts, we can begin to elucidate our own struggles to make sense of tables of infection rates and to attend to the stories we'll hear from Black and b</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We proposed and had approved a session entitled "Teaching Memory Studies"&amp;#x0D; Excerpt from our session proposal:&amp;#x0D; "Negotiating Sites of Memory," the presidential theme for the 2015 MLA convention together with the approval of an MLA Memory Studies forum in 2014 attest to an increasingly widespread application of the discipline of memory studies to the areas of scholarly endeavor the MLA supports, including the teaching of literature and writing. Previous MLA sessions related to teaching memory studies include "Teaching Life Writing Now" (presiding, Cassuto, 2011), and "Reading Memory: Approaches to Teaching the Memoir" (presiding, Donohue, 2015). Our panel will contribute to this growing conversation while also pushing the boundaries of memory studies pedagogy in literature courses beyond its close affiliation with memoir and literary criticism to attend to the cultural processes by which memories are shared. In the past several decades "cultural memory" has developed as a term to describe the ways societies remember their past using a variety of media (Astrid Erll and Ann Rigney). In this context, virtually any object of literary and cultural studies is a work of remembering, even as it at once evokes and takes root in readers' and viewers own memories, a process that takes place on the collective as well as personal level. Together our papers demonstrate that by bringing the interdisciplinary tools of memory studies into the classroom, we are able to create an "official" disciplinarily structured space for exploring the contents and operations of memory both in an object of study and at the interface of object and viewer/readers, thus opening an awareness of memory as a life practice that is fluid, creative, and shared.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What happens when a new interpretive framework passes into the hands of a practitioner of applied basic research? Thomas Edison, perhaps the most accomplished technological thinker in the U.S., was such a person in 1885 when he took up the implications of electromagnetic field theory. Edison's recent work on wireless telegraphy coincided with papers by British mathematician and engineer Oliver Heaviside, who, like Edison, was a former telegrapher and a capable experimentalist. The start of Edison's effort is marked by several pages of undated and previously overlooked tables outlining reciprocal relationships between electrical and magnetic energy and the passage of energy through corresponding devices such as electromagnets and condensers. In these pages he began to formulate an applied research program into the&amp;#x0D; convertibility of energy and its propagation through space. Edison hoped to generate new knowledge that might have practical applications. He also sought to identify a new form of energy. He had for years believed in the possible existence of such energy, provisionally named "XYZ," and now prepared to look systematically for "a new radiant force, lying somewhere between light and heat on one hand and magnetism and electricity on the other." Edison's inquiry took him not to&amp;#x0D; Maxwell but back to Faraday's Experimental Researches, from which he adapted ideas and experiments. Adopting Faraday's outlook and methods, Edison pursued XYZ and related questions, hoping to make a fundamental discovery of practical importance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper and presentation entails a close analysis of radical Islamist written (e.g. in pamphlets and treatises) and visual (e.g. as in ISIS video propaganda) rhetoric invoking both the "humiliation of Islam" and exhorting listeners to make the enemies of Islam "taste the humiliation" that has been imposed upon Muslims. By argument and example I demonstrate not only what such rhetoric says but also how it works--that is, how it resonates and even energizes certain experiences of powerlessness among Muslims (and among Muslim men in particular) situated in very different contexts who may share very little with one another--and very little with radical Islamists in addition. I also argue that this pattern is far from unique to Islam and to Muslims, but is operative in many different circumstances and contexts, including in contemporary American invocations of national humiliation by Muslims.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When we think about places of invention we tend to think of those places where an inventor did his or her most important work or mature work.  In the case of Thomas Edison this is usually his Menlo Park Laboratory and secondarily his later laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey.  However, these laboratories were not isolated places.  Instead they were part of larger networks of places that contributed in a variety of ways to the inventive activity at the labs.  Furthermore, the creation of these laboratories drew on and embodied aspects of earlier places in Edison's career.  In order to understand the inventive work that took place in these laboratories we need to examine their relationship to these other places.  At the same time, by looking at the range of inventive places in which Edison worked during his career we can also gain deeper insight into how particular places contributed to specific types of inventive work.  In this paper I will focus on the ways in which Edison's early experiences helped to shape his more his more famous laboratories and his inventive practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session/workshop has the dual aim of familiarizing an audience that may have limited exposure to the history and current state of design explorations in the area of Universal Design with that background and the experience of becoming "test subjects" in a simulation that will acquaint them with the difficulties of dealing with disabilities and the performance of daily tasks.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Russell Flinchum will explore the background of this history at NC State University, beginning with the figure of architect Ronald L. Mace (1941-1998), an outstanding leader who turned his personal challenge of extensive incapacitation from polio as a child into the achievement of becoming the recognized leader of the Universal Design movement by the early 1990s (it was Mace who coined the term "Universal Design).&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This first phase of exploration was largely about the removal of physical barriers to access, and culminated in the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. In the following twenty-five years we have seen investigations shift to a more personal level (at the time of Mace's death, blood glucose analyzers were just beginning to see improvements in user comfort, convenience and effectiveness stemming from the collaboration of human factors experts with industrial designers).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Following the Edict of Expulsion of 1290, Jews and Judaism continued to be targeted by English poets, preachers, and chroniclers via retellings of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD by Roman forces. These narratives anachronistically imagined the destruction of Jerusalem as retribution for the Crucifixion, when in fact the siege occurred centuries before the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity. Examples of such works include the alliterative Siege of Jerusalem, chronicle histories of John of Tynemouth and Ranulf Higden, and theatrical versions performed as late as 1622, when a play entitled Titus and Vespatian was recorded at the court of James I.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The goal of this paper is twofold. I will first demonstrate how a single 15th-century manuscript, Cleveland Public Library MS W q091.92-C468, interweaves the history of Jerusalem with the history of England itself. The manuscript opens with a brief geographical text surveying Biblical lands and begins "Iosephus of Iewis the noble was the first auctour of the book of policronica." This is followed by an abridged version of the prose Brut, a comprehensive history of England, and the brief poem Cur mundus militat. The manuscript closes with the sole surviving Middle English prose translation of Roger D'Argenteuil's Bible en François, which details the fall of Jerusalem. As such, English history is bracketed by Josephan history, and the reader is invited to understand it through this lens.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; My second goal is to show that this positioning of texts is emblematic of the significant place that Jerusalem occupied in late medieval English memory. I will pay particular attention to 1) the role that ‘curated memory' played in the sacrament of confession and in medieval sermons, which often urged a mindfulness of past transgressions, and 2) the purpose of narratives featuring ‘successful' conquests of Jerusalem in an era of failed crusades to recapture the city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As a NEH summer seminar participant in July 2015 who began teaching a course on the History of Design in August, I was in an exceptional position to apply techniques from the seminar directly to my class.  In my excitement to go "beyond the canon," I radically revised my canonical schedule in the eleventh hour and discovered the difficulty of going beyond the canon with art and architectural history students who were not familiar with the canon of design. My correction resulted some unexpected and enlightening juxtapositions. In my presentation, I will share the methods learned at the NEH seminar that I used in my class and their results including the student's major assignment, which focused on objects in the Charleston Museum's collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will explore my approach to teaching, Ways of Seeing Fashion.  Rather than creating a survey of the history of fashion, I used a textbook and timeline as the backbone of the course, but focused each class on a more in-depth case study that would allow for a broad range of topics addressing the concepts of Gender, Taste (class) and Globalization that were engaged with in the NEH summer institute.  This has allowed us to dive deeply into specific topics that might not get much coverage in a traditional survey of fashion history; the history of labor practices in the garment industry, the Qipao and the New Woman in China, the political meanings of the Zoot Suit in the 1940s, or the role of fashion in the Civil Rights movement, for example.  I have also incorporated multiple approaches to the study of fashion including business history, gender and sexuality studies, art history, as well as visual and cultural studies, drawing on popular magazines and newspapers, memoir, popular films, and documentaries.  Rather than a history of styles and silhouettes the class gives students the tools to analyze fashion and how it is used to signify in multiple contexts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Prebles textbook I use for my "Introduction to Art" class contains a broad scope of the purposes art has served throughout world history and culture. These include objects designed for everyday use, yet I found myself teaching this class to my strengths, which is the history of European and American painting and sculpture since the Renaissance. After attending the NEH seminar on Design History in the summer of 2015, I began to reevaluate the purposes and opportunities latent in a class designed for non-majors. How could I help students better understand the world around them? Could I develop the vocabulary and visual thinking of non-artists with designed objects? Could we have discussions of materials and aesthetic choices in light of function? How could I help students see the objects around them more vividly while also connecting these objects to largely unwritten histories? Would discussing everyday objects be more interesting and relevant to my students? In this presentation I will discuss specific approaches and ways I have tried to answer these questions, sharing the successes and failures in the classroom.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Institute at Drexel University on design featured several trips to local collections that highlighted the allure of interaction with primary materials.  But not every university is situated within such a close proximity to the kinds of institutions that house these collections.  Nor is it often feasible to transport or accommodate larger classes.  Digital collections of design at the Library of Congress and design museums like the V&amp;amp;A provide a way to bring the simulation of primary source contact into the classroom setting.  In this paper I will describe the way in which I have mined these online digital collections for their images.  With these images, I have developed in-class activities that not only serve to expand the canon of design presented in most textbooks, but also increase student engagement, learning, and retention through the promotion of active learning.  Thus I have utilized some of the teaching models presented at the Institute, and will report on their strengths and challenges as I have put them into practice over the last two semesters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will explore the ways that a photograph of a Mangbetu woman named Nobosodrou, taken by George Specht in 1924 influenced fashion designers from the 1920s through the present.  The photograph was by far the most famous image that emerged from La Croisière Noire (The Black Crossing), an expedition across the Sahara sponsored by Citroën.  The photograph circulated in a diverse array of media throughout the 1920s and 1930s: books, postcards, posters, sculpture, and most curiously, fashion. In books, the photograph was used as evidence of what many European explorers had identified as the Mangbetu people's advanced and hierarchical society.[i]  The dignified and elegant profile of a woman whose skull had been carefully shaped by binding when she was a child was emblematic of the aesthetics of the Mangbetu, which were often linked to ancient Egypt.[ii]   The image was adopted in hat designs in the 1920s and 1930s, and continues to have currency in fashion, appearing most recently in photographs made by designer Thierry Mugler in 1988 and John Galliano in 2008.  This paper will explore the ways that this hairstyle reflects both modernist aesthetics and exoticism, which have given it extraordinary staying power.  It has become a generic signifier of Africa in visual culture, but especially in fashion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Known for its famous opening credits utilizing a telephone answering-machine, "The Rockford Files" was a 1970s weekly television series that narrated the exploits of Los Angeles private investigator Jim Rockford. The show frequently involved Rockford impersonating different characters in order to get the information required for his investigations.  As such, the audience sees Rockford as he talks his way into and out of many situations at various Los Angeles locales.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Because a majority of "The Rockford Files" was shot outside and on location, it could be said that the show's set of was primarily Los Angeles itself.  In contrast to the typical image of 1970s New York portrayed in television and cinema of the time – crumbling, seedy, crime-ridden – the image of Los Angeles in "The Rockford Files" is generally a positive one; and modern architecture plays a large role in conveying this positive message.  Modern-styled office buildings, schools, hospitals, courthouses, universities, museums, apartments, hotels, parking garages and even supermarkets all play prominent roles in the story-lines of "The Rockford Files."&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; When looking at the entire six years of the series (and 8 TV movies) what emerges is a picture of Los Angeles as a modern, forward-looking and progressive city.  Interestingly, this is all done without the use of any of the typical or "canonical" modern architecture gems of Los Angeles.  Instead, lesser-known "vernacular modern architecture" examples populate the Los Angeles of "The Rockford Files," perhaps in contrast to the mobile home that Jim Rockford lives in – or maybe in parallel?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As happened elsewhere in France magistrates and jurors in the court of justice in Pau sometimes delivered disproportionate judgments during the post-liberation trials of suspected collaborators. As other studies of this period have shown, the initial slowness with which the court operated frustrated both the authorities and the local population, many of whom resented the leniency accorded to well-known collaborators in their communities.  Yet the search for truth and justice in Pau was rather unusual in several respects: on numerous occasions the authorities interrogated German prisoners of war and their former interpreters in an attempt to identify "the bad French." The court of justice often gave considerable weight to their testimonies. Rather than becoming invisible as POWs, such Germans paradoxically became "insiders" by playing their part in the trial process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper tells the extraordinary tale of complicity between a French couple and the German officer who requisitioned part of their elegant hotel during the Occupation. The couple obtained false ID papers and provided rooms and jobs for hundreds of Jews seeking passage to Spain across the Pyrenees. The Jews posed as tourists in the hotel and, when employed by the hotel, served German soldiers who remained ignorant of their true identities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores the wartime and postwar experiences of four men who operated as clandestine guides in the western Pyrenees during the German occupation. Two were classified as "bad guides" owing to their immoral behavior: they often took large sums of money from the Jews who hired them to take them across the Pyrenees into Spain and alerted the Germans about their forthcoming clandestine passage in return for payment. The other two passeurs were the epitome of moral rectitude as they performed their highly dangerous tasks in saving the lives of Jews, Allied pilots and French evaders of obligatory work service in Germany.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper traces German intellectual interest in the Basques to the writings of Humboldt, through the 19th and early 20th centuries. German universities established chairs in Basque Studies and created numerous journals that dealt with the Basque language and Basque notions of racial purity. During the Great War, German academics used Basque prisoners of war as a resource for collecting Basque folktales and folksongs. During the interwar years several prominent Nazi jurists visited the French Basque Country to promote Basque-German relations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the court of public opinion, the ceramic tiki mug is likely to elicit a range of reactions based on the time period in question. A 1940s Los Angeleno might associate the material object with memories of a wild night at the popular Don the Beachcomber establishment, filled with ‘exotic' sights, sounds, and libations. A citizen of the 1980s might associate the mug with tackiness and tastelessness, or worse yet, might not be able to make any association with the mug at all, owing to tiki's fall from popularity. But today, the seasoned craft bartender (also known as a ‘mixologist') will likely see the mug as an opportunity to craft a historic tiki cocktail or an updated remix. The last two decades have seen a spate of new tiki bars open across the United States whose focus is less on kitsch and more on craft, the complicated exotic cocktails and their elaborate vessels serving as demonstrations of one's virtuosity and knowledge. This project contends that the contemporary tiki revival of the last two decades, which encompasses not only bars and glassware but an entire lifestyle of conventions, clothing, sculpture, and music, owes its popularity to the combination of both the localized, grassroots circulation of information and mass media's glamorized portrayals of historical drinking culture. This chapter explores material and cultural aspects of the tiki revival, considering the role of media ranging from early internet forums, self-published zines, and small-print books to widely available mass market television shows, films, and magazines. Furthermore, the chapter argues that the rhetoric surrounding contemporary tiki culture, which is distinctly American, displays a selective reclamation of values, eschewing the culture's historical roots in orientalism in favor of a quasi-anthropological unearthing of historical tiki knowledge, an appraisal of its geographical inaccuracies, and an indulgence in temporal nostalgia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When Beyonce took the stage or, rather, the football field, at the 2016 Super Bowl Halftime Show, she employed potent stylistic references along with music and dance to present a narrative laden with alternate meaning and political subtext. Her bandolier jacket referenced a similar jacket worn by Michael Jackson during his 1993 Super Bowl performance, while her dancers were styled in costumes visually reminiscent of 1960s Black Panther dress. Beyonce's performance employs historical images to speak to present concerns while simultaneously highlighting and visually recontexualizing historical milestones, creating a historical trajectory which connects the past and present to speak to future possibilities for addressing race in America. This paper explores occurrences such as these as an effective tool for examining and re-examining fashion history, arguing that popular culture plays an important role in presenting and representing historical images. Furthermore, such referential occurrences create historical links that can, oftentimes, reinterpret the past in a way that archival images and documents alone cannot. The visual and symbolic links created between the past and the present are useful tools for students examining fashion history since they speak to multiple time periods at once, challenge canonical representations of history, and offer multiple interpretations. Focusing on case studies which present an alternate reading of history or unearth typically forgotten images and references, this paper presents the contemporary self-referential popular culture image as a beneficial tool that can be used to highlight the subversive and political potential of dress history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Hair, as a particularly malleable component of our embodied selves, is a tool that can help symbolize our identity. Subject as it is to a variety of fashion trends and cycles, it can be taken as indicative of individual as well as collective shifts in identity construction. The spate of celebrities who have adopted ‘unnatural' hair colors in recent years, from cotton-candy pink to aqua blue, reflects at once a seismic shift in techniques of self-fashioning and a continuation of historical beauty practices meant to embody the particular beauty ideal of the time. This paper traces the history and contemporary use of 'unnatural' hair dyes (pink, purple, blue, etc.) and the different reasons women have had for dyeing their hair these 'unnatural' shades. Contemporary celebrities like Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj engage with beauty culture as a status symbol and individualizing technique drawn from earlier subcultural dress practices, while caricatured ‘granny' rinsers Betty Slocombe and Dame Edna Everage serve as a satire of older women's seemingly frivolous and clumsy engagement with fashion and beauty culture. Most of all, these discourses address the notion of authenticity, as these seemingly unnatural colors highlight complex and oftentimes contradictory beauty discourses. Diverse media are implemented in the study, ranging from vintage hair and beauty advertisements to magazine spreads and publicity shots.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many graphic design movements that came after the Industrial Revolution criticized the way type was used in letterhead, business cards, posters, advertising, etc. The criticism stemmed from the fact that printers were not designers and didn't know how to properly use type. Some type foundries were criticized for creating "monster fonts"; highly stylized typefaces that were mash-ups of classics and also architecturally inspired. To add to the "fussiness" of these designs were ornamental borders and motifs that were scoffed at for being over the top. These over the top designs/layouts were typically created by a printer and client, not a graphic designer.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; For over 75 years type and printers ornaments were considered kitsch and unacceptable for use in graphic design. In the late 90's there was a revival of these beautiful pieces and can be seen in everything from editorial spreads, posters, websites, invitations, business cards and more. Fortunately there are multiple archives that hold these "relics" of the past and many letterpress and design studios that are reusing and reviving them in interesting and surprising ways.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This paper will explore some of the reasons behind this revival and the role of the early 20th century printer as designer (specifically an artist Herman Ihlenberg) and the new role of the 21st century printer designer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In my previous research I have argued that there is a predominantly negative image of cubicles in American popular culture since the late 20th century; echoed in cartoons, films, and even news stories, "the sea of cubicles" or "cube farm" has become a familiar short hand for "dreary office work" and the "bored" white-collar worker. Although this kind of image of the cubicle office with its tidy rows of desks and panels in perfect rectilinear alignment can be seen an expression of organizational surveillance, bureaucracy and control, the history of the office cubicle is also littered with tales of workers' efforts to subvert that corporate order. From posting passive-aggressive comic strips on panel walls to using the semi-privacy of the cubicle to engage in acts of non-work, anti-work, or even direct sabotage, the cubicle also creates opportunities for resistance. Drawing on Michele de Certeau's concept of "poaching" or "la perruque," this paper will explore the cubicle as a site of transgressive workplace behavior and consider how the very walls that serve as an expression of organizational control also offer workers space to challenge that authority through acts of resistance. Using news stories, zines, archival research, and fictional representations, this paper will analyze how the material aspects of the cubicle office create opportunities for subversion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Starting in the 1970s, computers and other types of VDTs (visual display terminals) became common fixtures in American offices. These new devices changed the structure and content of a number of clerical and white-collar jobs, and according to ergonomic research of the time, created new forms of physical, emotional, and psychological stress for workers. While some of the physical issues associated with computer usage were sources of temporary discomfort for workers, others could lead to long lasting or even permanent injuries and disabilities. Although the computer was recognized as the source of the problem, its design and use was largely unchallenged. Instead, recommendations to address these known issues focused on the provision of specialized ergonomic furniture along with environmental and behavioral changes that could ameliorate some of the problems. While the technology was increasingly fixed and standardized in its basic design, ergonomic furniture had to be optimally flexible to accommodate diverse bodies and uses. The emphasis on changing furniture and behavior instead of computer</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation focused on dancer/choreographer Eleo Pomare and his aesthetic, social, and political imperatives during the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and1970s.  It stressed his early association with other black artists and intellectuals who were active during the period; and it emphasized important projects such as the Dancemobile, his series of traveling dance concerts that were presented throughout the New York City area.  Such projects underscored the mission of the Black Arts Movement to take meaningful art to African-American communities that would not otherwise have access to that type of cultural enrichment.  Of equal importance, proponents of the Black Arts Movement made it a point to see that their art underscored messages of self-definition, self-esteem, and self-empowerment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper tests the conference's hypothesis regarding varieties of transcendence as cosmomorphic, sociomorphic, and noomorphic (Hypothesis No. 2) and their presence across religious traditions (Hypothesis No. 7) in relation to the Kashmir Saiva anthropology of thirty-six categories (tattvas). A heuristic use of the cosmomorphic, sociomorphic, and noomorphic finds all three present in Kashmir Saiva thought, integrally related to one another through a principle of homology. If a scholar were to look only for these three dimensions of human experience and transcendence, however, one would miss important dimensions of this rich anthropology that come to the fore when we consider the blurry zones of consciousness. The paper therefore offers suggestions for developing the hypothesis in relation to the Kashmir Saiva kancukas or limitations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Christian feminist theologians and theologians of disability observe that most definitions of the idea that human beings are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26) exclude certain people from meeting the full realization of this image--especially women, children, racial minorities, and persons with disabilities. This paper considers what Christian theology can learn about the image metaphor in light of the parallel Kashmir Saiva Hindu notion of reflection (bimba/pratibimba). In particular, the comparison suggests that the image contains many facets, that all of them can be framed in terms of embodiment, and that both limitation and the material elements have a foundational role.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The aim of Project Andvari, supported by a Digital Humanities Start-up Grant from the NEH, is to provide a free digital portal for integrated access to dispersed collections of northern European art and artifacts of the early medieval period (4th–12th centuries). The project was conceived by Lilla Kopár of The Catholic University of America (CUA) and I, in collaboration with Worthy Martin and Daniel Pitti of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia, who are coordinating the technical specifications of the project. In 2013, we convened an international workshop for humanities scholars, museum professionals, and technology experts from Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to refine the conceptual design of the proposed research tool and identify its technological requirements in preparation for a pilot project. We initiated partnerships with The British Museum and the National Heritage Board of Sweden to aggregate data from their digital collections. In 2014, we held a small workshop of content specialists in medieval art and archaeology, library and information science specialists, and technology experts to lay the foundations of a project-specific thesaurus of iconographical subjects for the Andvari portal. Our next step is to create a working pilot portal that will allow semantic searching. Ultimately, Project Andvari will facilitate interdisciplinary research in art, archaeology, history, and literary and religious studies of the northern periphery of medieval Europe, allowing users to study visual culture across media and beyond traditional geographical and disciplinary boundaries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Project Andvari is an international collaborative project designed to create a digital portal that will provide integrated access to collections of northern European art and artifacts of the fourth through twelfth centuries. The project title Andvari evokes many features of this new research tool. Andvari (Old Norse ‘the careful one') is the name of a dwarf in Norse mythology, where dwarves are associated with arts and crafts. Andvari is the collector of a great treasure and a shape-shifter. Thus his character echoes the idea of a digital portal functioning as an aggregator and its utility in searching artistic elements transformed across media, regions, and cultures.&amp;#x0D; The goal of this presentation is to explain the rationale for and the objectives of Project Andvari. Despite the wealth of the surviving visual culture from early medieval Scandinavia and neighboring areas, primary materials are often difficult to access, scattered in specialized, national collections. Researchers working on artifacts in one medium are often unaware of parallels in another and use different terminology to describe similar elements. Recently, several collections of material restricted by medium, object type, or location have been made available through online catalogues, but these subsets have remained unconnected. Furthermore, the search functions of existing databases are often limiting since they pre-structure material in conventional categories dictated by scholarly traditions.&amp;#x0D; In response to these challenges, Project Andvari will facilitate interdisciplinary research in the northern periphery of medieval Europe, allowing users to study visual culture across media and beyond traditional geographical and disciplinary boundaries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Project Andvari is an international collaborative project designed to create a digital portal that will provide integrated access to collections of northern European art and artifacts of the fourth through twelfth centuries. The project title Andvari evokes many features of this new research tool. Andvari (Old Norse ‘the careful one') is the name of a dwarf in Norse mythology, where dwarves are associated with arts and crafts. Andvari is the collector of a great treasure and a shape-shifter. Thus his character echoes the idea of a digital portal functioning as an aggregator and its utility in searching artistic elements transformed across media, regions, and cultures.&amp;#x0D; The goal of this presentation is to explain the rationale for and the objectives of Project Andvari. Despite the wealth of the surviving visual culture from early medieval Scandinavia and neighboring areas, primary materials are often difficult to access, scattered in specialized, national collections. Researchers working on artifacts in one medium are often unaware of parallels in another and use different terminology to describe similar elements. Recently, several collections of material restricted by medium, object type, or location have been made available through online catalogues, but these subsets have remained unconnected. Furthermore, the search functions of existing databases are often limiting since they pre-structure material in conventional categories dictated by scholarly traditions.&amp;#x0D; In response to these challenges, Project Andvari will facilitate interdisciplinary research in the northern periphery of medieval Europe, allowing users to study visual culture across media and beyond traditional geographical and disciplinary boundaries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Explores a number of themes that are common to Milton and his Puritan context, as well as to Berry and our own context: leisure, work, worship, sexuality, spontaneity, community, and the ‘architecture of time.'  An additional theme, a ‘greater argument' beyond all of these themes, surfaces in both poets' work—"resurrection." Both poets translate Sabbath into the earthly experience of resurrection, or "heaven," to use Berry's term. Their poetry invites us to construct in our own lives a "place of rest" by living in the presence of resurrection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper analyses the ways Countess Sofia Panina represented herself in various autobiographical writings over the course of her life. It explores the usefulness of archetype of the "New Woman" of the fin-de-siecle  in understanding Panina's self-representation.  Although her life was repeatedly disrupted by family conflict, war, and revolution, Panina's autobiographical writings consistently portray her as the mistress of her fate, an autonomous, active woman who made her own moral choices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper considers the common assumption that grammatical morphology is likely to preserve more signal of language relationship than is basic vocabulary, and evaluates ways in which the dynamics and mechanisms of language change may make crucial reference to spatially and temporally variable aspects of typological structure and sociolinguistic practice. Through the lens of the Naduhup language family, further informed by a comparative look at three other Amazonian families, I present evidence for processes of morphological change that appear cross-linguistically unusual or extreme. These relate particularly to the rapid generation of new grammatical forms, even while basic vocabulary remains relatively conservative. They also are associated with ‘debonding' processes, flexible behavior of functional elements as between morphology and syntax, and relative promiscuity of grammatical elements' association with different word classes. Many of these phenomena can be linked to areally relevant structural characteristics, particularly the prevalence of verb serialization and noun incorporation, and an emphasis on nominalization as a subordination strategy. Many can also be shown to be grounded in locally salient sociolinguistic practices, most notably relating to zones of intensive, stable multilingualism, in which language contact has had a heavy hand in shaping rates and processes of change.</Abstract>

		<Title>Exploring innovation in grammatical morphology: A view from the Amazon</Title>
	</ConferencePresentation>

		<Abstract>While much work on language variation and change has stressed the view that "all linguistic processes are social processes" (Enfield 2003:7), relatively little attention has been paid to the ways in which specific (i.e. regionally variable) socio-cultural practices may guide processes of language change in particular ways. In this paper, I explore the hypothesis that specialized and ritual discourse forms – particularly song, myth, and shamanic incantation – are relevant loci for the development and propagation of linguistic innovations in the Amazon basin, particularly those associated with language contact. This possibility is suggested by a number of observations regarding these discourse forms: their extensive circulation and close replication across speakers, communities, and languages (see e.g. Beier et al. 2002, Epps &amp;amp; Stenzel 2013), their importance within multilingual regional communicative networks, and the social position of the specialists themselves, who tend to bring together both diffuse social networks and relatively high status. Also of note is the tendency for specialized discourse forms to involve alternative lexical and morphological forms, such that the diversity of lects and registers figures in a broader constellation of multilingual interaction – which goes well beyond the languages ‘proper' that are associated with geographic and ethnic distinctions (Epps forthcoming). I consider several examples of grammatical and lexical change in languages of the northwest Amazon that have plausible ties to specialist discourse.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Initiation of community engaged scholarship is not an event. It is often a long-term developmental process, requires recursive planning and assessment, and often engages multiple communities. We present a case study of a research project that grew into a community and collaborative archaeological endeavor that balances engagement between two descendant communities of opposing sides of St. Clair's Defeat, and the Northwest Indian War. Bridging the cultural gap between these two communities while maintaining commitment to accurate retelling of historical narrative presents many challenges. However, these challenges present direct opportunities to use anthropology in the public sphere to foster empathy and understanding through historical archaeological context. We engage with the popular, but uncritically one-sided, narrative represented in historical public interpretation and even school curricula. We confront this narrative with the full context of the historical and archaeological record. This confrontation facilitates frank, educational discussions about the innate humanity of the other side, leading to reflections about assumptions and a critical assessment of identity and self-history. These reflections enable engagement of both communities with the history and consequences of colonization for American Indians formerly of the Northwest Territory and beyond.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Monticello and the Legacies of Slavery examines the experience of slavery at Monticello as well as its painful legacies, among them the burdens of inequality still carried by many people of color in the United States. On what was once a working plantation, the paradox of slavery stands in stark relief to the ideals of liberty and equality that Jefferson embedded in the Declaration of Independence It has been specifically designed to bring the power of place and ideas of Monticello to schools, libraries, and other community venues. Drawing heavily from material gathered through the Getting Word Oral History Project, this exhibit gives voice to descendants of Monticello's enslaved community and their descendant. In addition to the enslaved families of Monticello, the 11-panel freestanding exhibition introduces the Monticello plantation, Jefferson's attitudes on race and slavery, and stories from the Getting Word Oral History Project – establishing an overall narrative arc from slavery to freedom.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Este proyecto surge como una respuesta al creciente llamado internacional de que debemos hacer más para promover y apoyar la diversidad cultural, lingüística y de conocimiento en el campo de las Humanidades Digitales y en la interpretación de archivos. Nuestro objetivo para emprender este trabajo es doble. Primeramente, queremos romper la barrera lingüística que las tecnologías creadas para trabajar fuentes manuscritas colaborativamente, que son principalmente anglocéntricas, presentan a los usuarios que solo pueden navegar plataformas en español y portugués. Recientemente, repositorios culturales ubicados en los Estados Unidos han estado utilizando cada vez más herramientas de "crowdsourcing" para conectar un público interesado a sus colecciones digitales, aprovechando la experiencia colectiva para mejorar la accesibilidad intelectual y nutrir los metadatos de fuentes manuscritas. Con el fin de proporcionar una vía más para que personas y comunidades que no puedan leer el inglés se involucren de manera significativa a las Humanidades Digitales, completamos la internacionalización y la traducción de la interfaz de una plataforma de código abierto llamada FromThePage (o "DeLaPágina" en español). FromThePage es una herramienta para la transcripción, traducción e indexación colaborativa de fuentes primarias, en particular aquellas que están escritas a mano y en que no se puede utilizar tecnologías de reconocimiento óptico de caracteres (OCR) para extraer el texto automáticamente.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project arises from the growing consensus that the Digital Humanities needs to do more to promote and support cultural and linguistic diversity. In order to provide an avenue for non-English literate communities to meaningfully engage and contribute to the Digital Humanities, we completed the interface internationalization and translation of an open source digital scholarship platform–FromThePage. FromThePage (FtP) is a tool for the collaborative transcription, translation, and indexing of primary source materials, particularly those that are handwritten or not readable by optical character recognition (OCR) technologies. Cultural repositories are increasingly using FtP to tap into the collective expertise of an interested public to improve the intellectual accessibility of handwritten sources and nourish their archival records. However, our research shows that few institutions have considered the subsequent preservation and ethical attribution of these citizen contributions in the archival record and scholarship. Part two of this project seeks to enhance FromThePage's collection management capabilities and exports to facilitate the development of workflows for preserving and adequately attributing collaborative scholarship for its ethical reuse. Our immediate goal for undertaking this work is twofold: 1) to break down barriers to access our organization's Spanish and Portuguese-language digital collections that have resulted from Anglocentric technology stacks, and 2) to collaborate with current Latin American partners in the interpretation of their digitized collections hosted on our servers. We hope that attendees learn about ways to enable ethical reuse of the products of crowd-sourced scholarship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mapping Tahlequah History (MTH) is a project based at Northeastern State University (NSU) that supports student immersive learning and development of a public educational digital humanities interactive map and accompanying database focused on local history. The map and database help make local historical information more accessible by providing students and other users with links to documents and other resources such as videos and pictures. Content on the interactive map is contributed by community members, faculty and students. In this presentation, we discuss our approach to this participatory GIS effort including contributions, attribution, quality control and other challenges we have encountered. This is a presentation for the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS) conference held in Oklahoma City during October 2021.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since room acoustics profoundly affect musicians' performance style, renderings of early music should account for historical acoustics as well as instrument design and ensemble size. This paper describes the the recording process for the project Hearing Bach's Music as Bach Heard It, which uses acoustic measurements and geometric acoustic modeling to render the soundscape of Bach's Thomaskirche in Leipzig, Germany in 1539 and 1723, the year Bach arrived. This historical model was used to calculate section-to-section binaural impulse responses for each section of musicians on a Bach cantata. Using real-time convolution and close-miking, the musicians were recorded while performing in the virtual church at both time periods, with audible differences between the two. Some discussion follows as to the optimal method for arranging dry multitrack recordings of historical works when separate anechoic chambers are not available for each musician.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Thomaskirche in Leipzig has a rich musical and cultural history, marked not only by its association with the Lutheran Reformation in the 16th century but especially by the tenure of J.S. Bach as cantor from 1723-1750. The church's interior has undergone several renovations of differing magnitudes since the earliest building constructed in the 12th century. In the 20th century, acoustician Hope Bagenal and Bach biographer C.S. Terry argued that the architectural modifications made by the Lutheran Reformers in the 16th century directly affected Bach's compositional palette by reducing the reverberation time and allowing more polyphonic and temporal variation in the liturgical works composed for the space. Here the history of the building and its renovations are presented, as well as acoustical measurements in the current church, which has been renovated since Bagenal's time to more accurately match the interior as it existed in Bach's time. Some comments are provided Bagenal's theory as well as the effect of the material and geometric changes made by the Reformers on the performance of Bach's music during his lifetime.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Bouleuterion (Council House) at Notion is one of a number of similar structures in western Asia Minor of comparable plan, size, and location; their identification as Bouleuteria is based largely on the latter two characteristics; they enclose large auditoria, capable of holding significant numbers of people, and they are situated on or near public squares.  The history of this building type is conventionally traced back to the Old and New Bouleuteria of Athens, dated to the late 6th and late 5th centuries respectively, but all the comparable buildings in Asia Minor are considerably later; the earliest securely dated example is the Bouleuterion at Miletus, constructed according to the dedicatory inscription to Antiochus IV between 175 and 164 BC. Thus while the Athenian Bouleuteria may indeed have served as precedents, and the New Bouleuterion at Athens was in fact also renovated in the 2nd c. BC, the building type exemplified by the Bouleuterion at Notion was essentially a Hellenistic creation.  The Bouleuterion at Notion was partially excavated by Mustafa Büyükkolanci in the 1994, and has recently been cleaned and documented. Rectangular both in external outline and in its internal seating arrangement, it is larger in plan (24.2 X 30.5 m) than any other comparable building – considerably larger than the Bouleuteria of Priene and Heracleia, for example, and larger also than both the Old and the New Bouleuteria at Athens. It can be reconstructed in detail both in plan and in section, thanks to its remarkably transparent design; the whole building is based on a unit of 16 Attic/Ionic feet. In its design, construction, and urban setting, the Bouleuterion at Notion adds new detail both to the history of the local community and to the development of one of the preeminent civic building types of Hellenistic architecture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Creating "oneness" through communication structures and research means creating inclusive and accessible communication research. Mobile technologies in recent years have been at the forefront of making more-accessible communication and media, with dozens of mobile-first accessibility features emerging. These technologies also have inspired many profound reconsiderations of space and place that increase accessibility. Therefore, the Mobile Communication Interest Group is uniquely positioned at ICA to support more media-accessibility studies but also, in particular, to support novel research approaches to accessible place-based media. Such studies radically could transform otherwise inhospitable terrain for people with disabilities, such as blindness, into comfortable and coherent common ground. In that regard, people who are blind advocate for more and better Audio Description – the remediation of visual media into audible media – like people who are deaf advocate for high-quality Captioning and Sign Language Interpretation. While Audio Description is primarily created for the benefit of people who are blind or people who have low-vision, it also can be helpful for people who are print dyslexic or even people who just want to learn more through their ears. In other words, more inclusive media is simply better media for more people. This study originated in a hackathon-like workshop, called a Descriptathon, in which more than 100 people from across North America (the U.S. and Canada) were brought together, gathered into teams, and trained over three days how to create Audio Description with the end goal of the intensive workshop to leave with an audio-described version of their place's print brochure. Each team had at least one person on it who was blind or who had low-vision.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For over 1,000 years, the Epipalaeolithic site of Kharaneh IV was a focal point on the landscape for hunter-gatherer groups, acting as an aggregation site for Early and Middle Epipalaeolithic peoples. Located in the eastern desert of Jordan, at the time of occupation the site was a lush wetland surrounded by a rich grassland environment, providing abundant of food and resources for the site's occupants. However, over time the wetland began to dry up and by 18,600 cal BP Kharaneh IV was abandoned. In this paper we discuss the final occupation of Kharaneh IV, linking the site's abandonment to increasing aridification of eastern Jordan. Environmental change is linked to social transformations and the eventual collapse of Kharaneh IV as an aggregation locale.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper is aimed at identifying core values of Audio Description that affected feelings of Social Inclusion. To identify these values, the authors hosted a hackathon-like "Descriptathon" that brought together more than 100 people from throughout the United States and Canada in a three-day intensive workshop designed to audio describe print brochures of communally important public places (16 national parks), with those descriptions being evaluated by blind or low-vision people using validated scales measuring aspects of Social Inclusion (Jason et al., 2015; McColl et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2008). Within that judging feedback, the authors also conducted a content analysis of the 122 qualitative responses received. An independent coder and one of the co-authors established a sufficient inter-rater reliability (78.6%, Cohen's Kappa= 0.71) over three passes through the data, which began with a list of 17 identifiable social-inclusion values that eventually were parsed to 5 broader labels, plus an "other" value for outliers. Those social-inclusion values in the description feedback were ultimately labeled as "Detailed," with description answering all of the questions of the listener, "Organized," when description seemed created with a clear structure, "Objective," when description was delivered from a neutral perspective, "Concise," when description avoided extraneous details, and "High Quality," when description was created with a polish and flair that the judges appreciated. By identifying and operationalizing those core values in this study – as compositional techniques for potentially increasing feelings of social inclusion and improving public health through more-inclusive public discourse – we then were able to test those values in practice in a second Descriptathon, offered in October 2021, which also included participants in the United Kingdom. This presentation will cover both parts of the study, and the development of the Social Inclusion values.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With a Grounded Theory approach, we have been analyzing texts to try to determine ways in which this type of description can be effective, to develop best practices for the field. In very quick summary of that process, we first read each description to determine its distinct thought units (which can be a word or a phrase). Then we categorize those units into themes, such as Age, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, etc. And then we go back into those higher-order categories, such as Gender, and really dig into them. Gender identity is constructed through 4 primary approaches in portrait Audio Description: •Use of a gendered name, such as John or Jennifer •Use of a gendered noun, such as man, woman, daughter, etc. •Use of a gendered pronoun, such as he, she, his, hers •And, use of descriptive words (adjectives, like bearded, female, etc.) or descriptive phrases (like wearing a dress, or carrying a purse)  And by determining those gender-construction methods, we can evaluate a description by how it uses such conventions, or not.  Gender is a good example of an area of contemporary discourse under negotiation, where some people are choosing gender-neutral pronouns, such as they, as a rhetorical act of protest against gender designations. Where this all will go, I have no idea. It's really beyond the scope of our project to try to shape or determine evolving discourse strategies. What we want to do instead is to study them and make these conversations accessible to everyone, through Audio Description.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Audio Description typically involves a sighted intermediary, who translates visual media into acoustic media, as neither the creator of the source material nor its intended recipient. This person audibilizes what can be seen in the source material, but the quality of that audibilization depends greatly on the skills, training, style, motivation, and engagement of the describer. This remediation process usually is conducted for the explicit benefit of people who are blind or low-vision. The image and the audible description often then are divorced, to create segregated experiences, involuntarily splitting people apart by how well they can see. In this process, one group of people typically learns about the source content from sight and the other from sound. Yet those acoustic representations – in terms of overall fidelity – are rarely equivalent in merit to the source material, so scholars and practitioners, especially in the past decade, actively have been refining industry best practices and academic insights in order to improve Audio Description qualities. A primary area of such scholarly focus is the quality of Audio Description products as artifacts of discourse.To address that topic, this study's author gathered more than 100 self-descriptions during two separate Audio Description-oriented workshops, about six months apart. That effort brought together people regardless of vision level, including people who were blind or low-vision, who also were offered the opportunity to describe themselves. The study's intent was to find ways to better understand, on a foundational level, how gender identity emerges through Audio Description.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this abstract, we explore transfer learning to improve post-correction for optical character recognition (OCR), specifically for documents that contain endangered language texts. We extend an existing OCR post-correction model (Rijhwani et al., 2020) by introducing an additional pretraining step on related data, such as text in a related language or available target endangered language datasets that may differ in orthography. Although cross-lingual transfer is often successful in high-resource settings, our preliminary results show that transferring from data in another language decreases performance for this task. On the other hand, we observe small improvements in performance when transferring from additional target language data.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation will describe the reconstruction of a damaged sixth-plate relievo ambrotype conducted under the supervision of the conservators at the Conservation Center for Art &amp;amp; Historic Artifacts (CCAHA). Relievo is a unique presentation method that gives an ambrotype portrait a sense of three-dimensionality by scraping away the collodion image layer around the sitter and painting the reverse of the glass support with black varnish. The glass support of the work in question was broken into six pieces with one area of loss. With Paraloid B-72 in toluene as an adhesive, it was stabilized using a vertical assembly method based upon reconstruction techniques used in glass conservation. Losses in the black backing were inpainted with pigments in Aquazol and adjusted for gloss. After treatment, the photograph and its housing components were rebound and reinserted into their case. The purpose of this case study is to share details of this treatment as well as considerations for adhesives and inpainting. This talk will also highlight ongoing research on the history of this ambrotype variation and present findings from a survey of relievo ambrotypes in the collection of the George Eastman Museum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Progress over the past decade in the digitization and analysis of text found in cultural objects (inscriptions, manuscripts, scrolls) has led to new methods for reading the "invisible library".  This talk explains the development of non-invasive methods, showing results from restoration projects on Homeric manuscripts, Herculaneum material, and Dead Sea scrolls.  Premised on "virtual unwrapping" as an engine for discovery, the presentation culminates in a new approach that may indeed be the pathway for rescuing still-readable text from some of the most stubbornly damaged materials, like the enigmatic Herculaneum scrolls.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Presentation at National Conference for Higher Education in Prison, 11/21  The nationwide field of Higher Education in Prison has enabled us to understand the complexity and significance of structuring a HEP program that ensures viability and sustainability during and beyond incarceration. As the TUPIT and PJI programs continue to flourish, we are learning more about HEP programs' potential benefits and potentially harmful effects for individuals, prison cultures, directly impacted communities, college communities. Centering informed perspectives of students, faculty, and directors based on personal experiences, this roundtable discussion aims to generate conversation on HEP best practices with respect to the relationship between the college and college-in-prison and thus with a focus on re-entry support and continuing education or degree completion. Topics will include 1) developing degrees and the bachelor's degree curriculum; 2) admissions/transfer  processes inside and outside of the facility; 3) re-entry program models, strengths and weaknesses; and 4) supporting students on all campuses (inside and outside).   Given that the individual and community impact of the carceral state is life long, HEP programs and colleges/universities should acknowledge this in program development by developing a continuum of care that addresses traumatic experiences before, during, and after incarceration. Both PJI and TUPIT are striving to develop programming along these lines to best support individuals' health and wellbeing. Through a commitment to the policy of doing no harm, program sustainability, and racial and economic justice through expanded opportunities for transformational education, in this discussion, TUPIT and PJI will compare and contrast the challenges and successes of our respective models, attending to the associate's and bachelor's degrees and the re-entry program structures, and focusing on ways that each supports students from college-in-prison to forme</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As more students approach college focused on their professional goals after they graduate, what place can the humanities occupy in this landscape of higher education? As the number of English and other Humanities majors has decreased over the last decade, the English Department at Doane University designed the Integrated Humanities program to attract students to our classes and emphasize our role in students' long-term career successes.   This session provides an overview of the Certificate in Integrated Humanities Program, which offers students a humanities-centered pathway through their general education requirements with an attention to their professional goals. In a pathway, students study a contemporary, complex issue, such as opioids and addiction or the politics of fear, from multiple disciplinary perspectives and engage in interdisciplinary, independent research to earn a Certificate. What makes this program particularly unique is that each pathway is rooted in experiential learning and intentional collaboration among faculty to make explicit to students the value of a strong liberal arts foundation. The coursework is also connected to co-curricular programming and community events that bring experts and practitioners from the region to share their experiences and perspectives with students.  The presentation will discuss the program itself, as well as highlight the planning and design process, calling attention to the obstacles we faced and the ways we were able to move past them. This work is supported by a Humanities Connections grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>More and more students enroll in college with a career or a professional goal in mind. Given that mindset, students are often frustrated by their general education requirements; the relevance of the broad foundation of general education to a specific career or major is not obvious to them. And yet, the broad foundation general education courses offer are integral to develop the range of skills needed in most careers. The aim to enhance students' general education learning and help them connect that foundation to their major programs of study is one shared by many faculty and administrators.  In 2020, Doane University launched the Certificate in Integrated Humanities, which connects students' career goals with a strong liberal arts foundation. The Certificate in Integrated Humanities establishes pathways through the Doane Core, the general education program, where students study an contemporary interdisciplinary issue, such as Opioids and Addiction, from multiple disciplinary perspectives. The program bundles existing courses with these new concept-based courses to make transparent the connections for students.  This interactive seminar will draw upon Doane University's successful launch of the Integrated Humanities program and utilize small group activities, individual brainstorming, and larger group discussion to help attendees think creatively about ways their institutions and departments might innovate their general education program. The activities will highlight potential obstacles and ways around them; practical steps to consider; and adaptability and scalability for these innovations. Participants will leave with new ideas and perspectives for innovating their general education offerings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The papers in this session explore how archaeology is uncovering the hidden components of the plantation landscape of James Madison's Montpelier. By turning our attention from the main house to the enslaved quarters, work buildings, roads, fields, and spaces of the plantation, a new understanding of what the landscape looked like and how it was used and navigated by members of the enslaved community can be uncovered. Papers in this session will place the latest discoveries from Phase I and II excavations into the broader understanding of the plantation landscape, how it is remembered, and interpreted.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper discusses how digital numismatics facilitates new research into ancient Syria for both academic and public audiences. From data visualization to a collaborative online exhibit, The SYRIOS Project demonstrates how digital humanities enhance the value of coins as historical evidence.    Phase One of the project critically reassesses the city of Antioch by applying the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis and digital mapping to a database of 300,000 coin finds. Although Antioch's prominence is famous, a quantitative analysis of coins minted in the city and excavated throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East exposes the gradations of imperial power and local agency mediated within its walls. Patterns in coin distribution serve as a significant index of spatial politics and the policies of the different authorities making use of the city. Evaluating the coins against other historical material reveals that Antioch's status was not fixed, nor the people passive pawns for external powers. Instead, as imperial governments capitalized upon Antioch's location and amenities, the citizens developed in their own distinct identities and agency – both financial and political. Antioch of the Antiochians must therefore be elevated from traditional narratives and static characterizations, being studied and celebrated for the dynamic polis it was. The results of Phase One will be published as a monograph with Cambridge University Press in Summer 2021.    Phase Two of the project aims to bring this scholarly research to a public audience through a dynamic online exhibit. Funded by the NEH, our collaborative team from the humanities and technology studies is currently developing a prototype focused on the coins and people of Antioch. Audiences can navigate an introduction to coins as historical evidence with a 3D model and parallax scrolling. Thematic narratives teach users how even a single coin can testify to political, economic, religious, and archaeological histories</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Small-scale multilingualism has been described as intrinsically different from more well-known polyglossic forms of multilingualism in contemporary urban/globalized societies.  In this talk, we take a closer look at one of the better-known cases of small-scale multilingualism: the Vaupés region of northwest Amazonia. In this highly multilingual society, individuals are commonly proficient in multiple indigenous and colonial (now national) languages.  Longstanding norms of exogamous marriages, political equilibrium among groups, and language ideology have traditionally supported this individual polylingualism and societal multilingualism. Local ideologies promote one's father's language as the primary marker of social identity and ostensibly mandate loyalty to this patrilect. Indeed, some ethnographic accounts argue that such patrilect-based essentialist ideologies are key in shaping some observed linguistic practices, including avoidance of lexical borrowing and restrained displays of multilingual prowess. Nevertheless, little is known about the actual use of multiple languages in everyday interaction, a gap our work seeks to address. We draw on a large corpus of video recordings of informal, everyday interaction collected from 2017-2019, focusing on cases of code-switching and accommodation, long presumed to be either unattested or highly dispreferred. We present evidence for a wider range of multilingual practices in the Vaupés than previously claimed, demonstrating the everyday accomplishment of multilingualism in social interaction. Our analysis and findings call into question the bifurcation of multilingualism into ‘small-scale' and ‘modern'(?)/'non-small-scale'(?) types. Instead, we argue for the development of a typology of multilingualisms based on empirical analysis of actual multilingual practices in everyday life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Vaupés region is recognized as one of Amazonia's better-known examples of small-scale societal multilingualism, with individuals commonly described as proficient in multiple indigenous and colonial/national languages. Continuing investigation of Vaupes society, however, is revealing a great deal of internal diversity that includes nuanced dynamics involving how individuals from different ethno-linguistic groups use languages as they navigate diverse social contexts.  Analyses of language ideology among Tukanoan groups credits the notion of "loyalty" to one's father's language as a force shaping broadly purported linguistic practices, including frequent simultaneous or "receptive" exchanges, curtailed lexical borrowing, and generally restrained displays of multilingual prowess. Nevertheless, little is known about the actual use of multiple languages in people's daily lives, a gap our work seeks to address through investigation of a large corpus of video recordings of informal, everyday interactions among members of Kotiria and Wa'ikhana (East Tukano) communities. We highlight contrasts between what people say they do (or don't do, or shouldn't do), focusing primarily on cases of code-switching and accommodation, both long presumed to be either unattested or highly dispreferred language behaviors. We provide empirical evidence for a wider range of multilingual practices than previously claimed for the Vaupés, demonstrating the everyday accomplishment of multilingualism in social interaction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The term ‘multilingual' can describe societies and individuals, as well as characterize communication involving multiple languages or, minimally, deployment of resources that speakers understand to come from different languages. Such deployment by speakers brings multilingualism into life for particular interactional purposes situated in specific social and sequential contexts. Our research examines multilingual practices in relation to explicit and implicit language ideologies in the "small-scale" multilingual Vaupés setting, and our multi-disciplinary approach facilitates direct comparison of language use in diverse multilingual settings, ultimately contributing to an empirically grounded typology of multilingualisms around the world.  Our talk and recent work analyzes data from a large corpus of video recordings of sociolinguistic interviews and spontaneous interaction collected in Kotiria and Wa'ikhana communities between 2017-2020. Our findings illustrate the need to distinguish explicit ideologies, observable in "people's opinions about the languages around them", from implicit ideologies, "covert systems of beliefs" revealed in actual language use  and how these may compete within speakers in different contexts. Excerpts from interviews and informal everyday interactions demonstrate both speaker perspectives on "being multilingual" (often orienting to explicit ideological norms) and their actual behavior "doing multilingualism" through a range of attested and common practices — from monolingual exchanges to cases of code-switching and accommodation — long presumed rare or highly dispreferred. Our analysis and findings pose the question of whether and how multilingualism "on the ground" might actually differ between "small-scale" and other multilingual scenarios and argue that part of the answer depends on empirical investigation — broad documentation of everyday interaction in a variety of multilingual settings — and comparative interactional analysis.</Abstract>

X-ray CT allows us to see the detailed internal structure of scrolls and books, but alone does not reverse any of the damage that occurred. This talk discusses how we use machine learning to enhance the results of X-ray CT, restoring artifacts to their full original splendor by revealing otherwise invisible inks, virtually reversing physical damage, and generating full color images.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The development of virtual unwrapping, which is based on the software analysis of volumetric images of damaged and unopened materials, has led to novel discoveries such as one of the oldest copies of Leviticus, written in Hebrew. Few are aware that the early development of virtual unwrapping was inspired by book bindings - in partial states of damage - containing text cannabilized from earlier manuscripts. In this paper we discuss those initial successful experiments, which revealed a new reverse side (hidden) text from Ecclesiastes, written in Hebrew. We then frame what we think is a very promising set of future opportunities using virtual unwrapping for bindings and covers that are damaged and/or require analysis in situ, in the context of the advances we have made in technologies for scanning (x-ray tomography) and analysis (machine learning and artificial intelligence).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In his latest play, Terrenal (2014), Argentine writer and director Mauricio Kartun presents a modern-day rewriting of the myth of Cain and Abel. The elaboration of the Biblical story transforms into a critique of capitalism and industrialization, the source of the ambition and greed that provoke Cain's ultimate fratricide. Throughout the work, the moral force and thematic universality of the play is filtered through details of smallness, from the scale of the staging (three actors, no set, and only a few props) to the dedicated labors of the two brothers (Cain, who cultivates red peppers, and Abel, who gathers beetles). Through an exploration of the aesthetics of the diminutive and the concentrate, drawn from Bachelard's The Poetics of Space and other critics, this paper reflects on the ethics of neo-liberal market forces and the value of the local. It will highlight select differences in the means of theater production in Buenos Aires as compared to other cultural capitals, such as New York. It furthermore identifies a shift, specifically in Argentina, but more generally in contemporary Latin American theater, that is suspicious of global institutions and reminds the public of the importance of protecting even a small portion of oneself apart from the forces of globalization. This paper also invites reflection and debate on the economic conditions that foster or inhibit artistic production in the U.S. and Latin America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Colombian theatre gained some relevance since the second half of the 20th century through a successful insertion in the "Nuevo Teatro Latinoamericano". This Nuevo Teatro was defined as essentially political, meaning an explicit engagement with social reality expressed in denouncing social injustices, uncovering the truth of State violence, reconstructing the memory of the acts of State terror, and calling their audiences to a public debate about the transformation of an unjust social order. In this paper, I propose that, since the 90s, face to the consolidation of neoliberalism and a long and deteriorated armed conflict in the country, this political commitment seems to have given way to a different kind of engagement: In the absence of effective State policies of truth, justice, and reparation, "Theatre of Human Rights", as termed by the Corporación Colombiana de Teatro, would work as a cultural medium for symbolic reparation. Thus conceived, the political task of theatre would be to restitute the victims' name, their dignity, their place in the social contract that binds the nation together, and of course, the humanity they have been stripped of by violent acts. I aim at interrogating this humanitarian approach, first by examining it in the light of a critique of Human Rights discourse, and second, by contrasting it with two contemporary plays that reflexively address the experience of violence and dehumanization beyond the idea of reparation: La técnica del hombre blanco by Víctor Viviescas and Donde se descomponen las colas de los burros, by Carolina Vivas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Guillermo Cacace's Mi hijo solo camina un poco más lento by the Croatian playwright Ivor Martinic has been one of the most successful and striking stage productions of the 2014-2015 theater season in Buenos Aires. Since its opening as part of the 2014 Festival Internacional de Dramaturgia Europa + América it has been sold out and continues to be so through October 2016. Although this new festival had very little publicity and no budget, the production seems to have evoked a powerful response. There is something uniquely Argentine happening here. A sensibility: not only in how the work translates into a specific cultural space, but how the theatrical praxis creates a specific type of work in the making.&amp;#x0D; I propose to exam Cacace's production, exploring both his directorial choices and the acting style and technique. In doing so, I will examine theater's unique capacity to present a concentrated form of what Krzysztof Ziarek has called art's forcework. By analyzing the praxis of the performer in relation to the event as a whole, I will investigate the dual nature of theater's transformative forcework.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Though material culture is widely recognized as a cornerstone of interdisciplinary Anglo-Saxon Studies, the physical remnants of Anglo-Saxon daily life are still, all too often, being analyzed by specialists working in isolation from one another. Recently, several online databases and catalogues have made subsets of these materials widely available, mainly in the form of digital resources focused on one particular medium, object type, or location. But in spite of the easy availability of such corpora of digital images and object descriptions, it remains difficult to connect them to one another, not only because of the disparate nature of the artifacts themselves, but also because we lack the unifying terminologies and descriptive schemas that would allow for comparisons across disparate artistic media, scholarly disciplines, and national and language boundaries. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Project Andvari [http://andvari.iath.virginia.edu] is an international collaborative project, funded by NEH, that proposes a solution to these challenges by creating a free digital portal that will provide integrated access to collections of northern European art and artifacts of the early medieval period (4th–12th centuries). The project has four main objectives:&amp;#x0D; •To offer integrated access to the existing but dispersed artifactual record of northern European art of the early medieval period;&amp;#x0D; •to augment and enhance existing data and metadata;&amp;#x0D; •to allow humanities scholars to study the aggregated material in an interdisciplinary fashion and to promote analyses of relationships (both of artifacts and of cultures); and&amp;#x0D; •to promptly disseminate information about new discoveries and provide a shared virtual workspace for researchers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper presents a sequential assemblages of data points on wildlife uses, users, and local community welfare within a significant Zambian GMA. Within the Luangwa Valley, land and resource access have been vexing and contested issues for centuries. Here powerful agents and agencies have sought to secure and strengthen advantageous  forms of access through violence and offensive force as well as through more subtle excursions, intrigue, enforced boundaries, and lawful processes. 'Technologies' of control and governance as well as local responses are products of their time, yet these same processes actively create new 'frontiers' of land, wealth and health through progressive struggles between different actors, varying contexts and procedures.  The irony is that both colonial and postcolonial agencies have sought to destroy, if not destabilize, local communities' abilities to manage resources within the context of local livelihoods, while simultaneously claiming to serve conservation and community interests.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Frontiers are not just noted for their normative deficiencies and risks;often they are craved as places for adventure and potential wealth.  Planners perceive such frontiers as places with unregulated , potential resources and design projects for outside commercial interests and as generators of revenue.  Economic booms on frontiers also attract migrants seeking opportunities  not available to them elsewhere.  Overlooked in these hinterlands are local residents, whose efforts to harness wildlife are often dismissed even in areas where they depend upon wildlife for food and to protect their lives and properties from them This paper describes the interactions between insiders and outsiders over wildlife and its issues over four significant years.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Project Andvari is an NEH-funded international collaborative project designed to create a free digital portal that will provide integrated access to collections of northern European art and artifacts of the early medieval period (4th–12th centuries). The pilot (in progress) will aggregate data primarily from The British Museum, Norwich Castle Museum, and Kringla (Sweden). The current presentation will focus specifically on issues of metadata and related technical aspects of the project as a case study. The nature and structure of metadata for Andvari has been determined by researchers' needs as much as by practical considerations. Decisions were based on an interdisciplinary conversation in which scholars of various fields stated what they envisioned such a resource would include; LIS practitioners offered recommendations on how to best meet user needs based on actual information seeking behavior; and information technology specialists provided insight into what would be possible, given technological constraints.</Abstract>

Project Andvari, an NEH- funded program, proposes to create an aggregate digital repository that will promote use of disparate collections of early medieval (4th-12th Century) Norse art and artifacts by providing unified discovery and access to several digital collections of bracteates, pictures stones, coins, and more. An investigation into the proceedings of the initial project meeting held in November 2013 reveals that the Andvari project approach establishes the foundation upon which a sustainable aggregate repository will be built. By highlighting the project goals and intended repository functionality, the Andvari platform model is shown to facilitate innovative digital scholarship of medieval Norse material culture by promoting novel comparative analyses of previously distributed objects. Additionally, an acknowledgement of the diverse disciplinary backgrounds of the initial project meeting participants illustrates the positive influence of brining the perspectives of medievalists, information technology specialists, and cultural heritage librarians to bear on the identification of conceptual scope, organizational approach, and technical feasibility. The final analysis of the Project Andvari initial project meeting concludes that the overall project objectives and the approach to planning, design and implementation will likely result in a digital aggregate repository that will promote digital scholarship and provide a useful model for future repository design and production.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As part of Project Andvari, a digital humanities initiative to aggregate early medieval northern European artifacts, it was deemed necessary to develop a semantically structured iconographic thesaurus to properly describe the iconographic content of distributed artefactual collections from a variety of contributing institutions. Developed according to SKOS-methodologies through open-access platforms, the thesaurus will ultimately be integrated into the project platform and made available for distributed implementation and linkages to broadly adopted authorities. Despite a solid conceptual foundation, project members were concerned about the resource's ability to properly describe resources based on domain-specific scholarly practices. With this in mind, the project team partnered with Micropasts – a crowdsourcing platform sponsored by the British Museum – in order to create a Pybossa-based crowdsourcing application through which researchers, graduate students, and the public could test the thesaurus by applying terms and concepts to digital objects collected from the British Museum and the Swedish National Heritage Board. In this poster, we will present the underlying concept behind the utilization of crowdsourcing approaches to perform initial testing of a controlled vocabulary resource, highlighting the benefits of bringing multiple subjective perspectives to quality assurance efforts. The poster will also discuss the development of the crowdsourcing application in collaboration with the Micropasts team. Finally, the poster will present initial findings of the crowdsourcing initiative, analyzing term usage and recommended concepts in order to determine both the usability of our thesaurus and the feasibility of our quality assurance approach. The poster will finally present actionable recommendations for future projects interested in implementing crowdsourcing approaches to authority record testing and enhancement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ever increasing in their ubiquity, digital humanities initiatives seek to blend traditional humanities scholarship and technological solutions to produce new approaches to scholarship and materials. But what can library science practitioners bring to the table? Headquartered at the Catholic University of America, Project Andvari is a digital humanities initiative that seeks to promote research and access to early medieval Northern European material culture. Starting in late 2013, I joined the project team as both a project assistant and as a library science scholar. This poster covers the impact that interdisciplinary engagement has had on the project and discusses some of the project enhancements that have been inspired by LIS approaches. This poster will also discuss a unique project development: a crowdsourcing application that combines medieval studies, museum collections, and library science disciplines in the pursuit of refining authority controls.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper was presented at the Annual national conference of the Labor and Working-Class History Association in Washington, D.C.&amp;#x0D;      The paper, drawn from parts of several chapters in my book manuscript, examined the concept of "urban citizenship" and the struggle to define the boundaries of working-class participation in municipal civic life during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Much of the agitation centered around the highly restrictive municipal franchise that limited access to the ballot and a significant political voice around critical issues of everyday life in cities.  The paper examined the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and the U.S.  The end of WWI produced significant expansion of suffrage but also renewed efforts by elites to limit "home rule" as an alternate method of disfranchisement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cuando los fundadores del Festival Nacional de Folklore de Cosquín (Argentina) lo crearon en 1961, tenían la meta de promover la música folklórica argentina --un "producto" del interior del país-- y darles oportunidades a músicos aficionados ly profesionales.  Si bien la música es todavía la parte central del Festival, la prensa y muchos asistentes suelen decir que el evento se ha convertido en un negocio y un espectáculo.  En este trabajo, examino las partes del Festival que están directamente conectadas a la música y al "negocio" del folklore.  Me centro en los actores musicales que son una parte muy importante del evento y los "caminos" que han seguido para lograr el éxito en el "sistema" musical que se ha desarrollado en el Festival.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>En esta ponencia, analizo las tensiones producidas por la presentación de varios tipos de danza en Cosquín y su impacto en la unión de la danza y la música en el festival.  Después de tratar el uso del folklore musical y bailado en el Certamen Pre-Cosquín, analizo un dilema que ocurrió en Cosquín 2005 en cuanto a cómo "modernizar" la música y coreografía del "Himno a Cosquín," que se usa para abrir el festival todas las noches.  Explico porque se fracasó este experimento y por ende cómo se presentaron el "Himno a Cosquín" y la danza en Cosquín 2010 (el Bicentenario).  Muestro que la danza quizás sea un símbolo de la identidad argentina más fuerte que la música en Cosquín.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Technologies of copying – printing, casting, digital duplication – have always engendered debates about artistic authorship and invention. Copying can be viewed as a debasement and as creative praxis. Albrecht Dürer complained about copyists but also advised young artists learning to draw to "copy the work of good masters until you attain a free hand." Copying can also produce originality. Andy Warhol's copies of Brillo Boxes expose this paradox, asking (in Arthur Danto's words): "What is the difference between two things, exactly alike, one of which is art and one is not?" This session brought together papers addressing techniques and functions of artworks that copy other objects (drawings, prints, casts, rubbings, photographs) produced from the early modern period to today, as well as the legal, ethical, philosophical and ontological issues embedded in copying in Europe, Africa and the Americas. The session encouraged a far-reaching dialogue about the problematic status of the copy in the history of art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper is based on selections from my forthcoming book on "The Mediterranean in the Islamic Cartographic Imagination," which focuses on the Mediterranean maps that illustrate manuscript copies of al-I??akhri's Kitab al-masalik wa-al-mamalik (Book of Routes and Realms), abbreviated to KMMS. The reason for my focus on the KMMS tradition is that I aim to understand the most popular and widespread medieval Islamic mapping tradition. While there are other examples of Islamic mapping most of these are singleton traditions with limited copies whereas there are in excess of thirty cartographically illustrated copies of al-I??akhri's map manuscript extant. Their number make them by far the most commonly replicated cartographic image in the central lands of the medieval and early modern Islamic world and therefore useful for deconstruction if we want to understand what kind of information on the Mediterranean was communicated to people who were exposed to these images.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Did medieval European maps influence the Islamic ones or vice versa? Or were they mutually exclusive? The question of Islamo-Christian cartographic connections is one of the major unresolved debates in the history of cartography. Scholars fall on both sides of the divide. A definitive answer to the question has been hampered by the lack of extant examples demonstrating Islamo-Christian cartographic connections. In this paper I discuss in depth a medieval European T- O map labeled in Arabic.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Every medieval Islamic Mediterranean map of the Kitab al-Masalik wa al-Mamlik (KKMS) tradition displays Qustantiniyya proudly astride the Bosphorus. These depictions vary with time, place, and milieu of copy. This talk will discuss the depiction of Constantinople and, by extension, Anatolia, in particular the thughur (the most heavily contested of all Christian-Muslim frontiers), which was the center of a six-century struggle for control between the Byzantine and Abbasid Empires that was eventually won by the Turkic tribes. I will show how the Anatolian thughur, in fact, underlined the classical KMMS map of the Mediterranean. Time permitting I will also discuss the commissioning of a cluster of Ottoman copies for Fatih's new post-conquest mosque libraries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For the purposes of this workshop, I plan to focus on a different area of the Mediterranean maps, in particular on the great Thughur and ?Awa?im area of Southeastern Anatolia. It is located in the lower right quadrant of the map running from the three river markers of the Jay?an, Say?an, and Baradan at the bottom (east) of the map to the Bosphorus (Khalij Qus?an?iniya) along the right (northern) flank of the map. (See template of Fig. 2; blue arrows indicate area of discussion) It spans in other words the region we refer to now as Anatolia, Asia Minor of yore, or rather a portion of it. That portion of coastal southeastern Turkey that borders on northern Syria and was an area of deep and sustained contestation between the Eastern Christian and Islamic worlds for the better part of six centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper I discuss the crucial role that Sicily plays as the lynchpin of medieval Islamic maps of the Mediterranean. I have spent the last two decades studying medieval Islamic maps in depth, in particular KMMS maps produced in the Kitab al-Masalik wa-al-Mamalik (Routes and Kingdoms) geographical manuscripts from the tenth century onwards. The maps of the Mediterranean, subject of my next book, consistently place Sicily at the center of their maps suggesting that the Muslims saw it as the central lynchpin of the Mediterranean around which the entire map was built. The question that I will explore in this paper is why Sicily is consistently placed as the central point of the medieval Islamic depiction of the Mediterranean. Out of this inquiry emerges the crucial discovery that some copies of this KMMS Mediterranean map were produced under the auspices of Norman rulership in the twelfth century Sicily.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper describes an Application Programming Interface (API) for addressing music notation on the web regardless of the format in which it is stored. This API was created as a method for addressing and extracting specific portions of music notation published in machine-readable formats on the web. Music notation, like text, can be "addressed" in new ways in a digital environment, allowing scholars to identify and name structures of various kinds, thus raising such questions as how can one virtually "circle" some music notation? How can a machine interpret this "circling" to select and retrieve the relevant music notation? The API was evaluated by: 1) creating an implementation of the API for documents in the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format; and by 2) remodelling a dataset of music analysis statements from the Du Chemin: Lost Voices project (Haverford College) by using the API to connect the analytical statements with the portion of notaiton they refer to. Building this corpus has demonstrated that the Music Addressability API is capable of modelling complex analytical statements containing references to music notation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How can one virtually ‘circle' some music notation as one would on a printed score? How can a machine interpret this ‘circling' to select and retrieve the relevant music notation in digital format? This paper will introduce the concept of addressability for music notation, on the basis of a comparison with textual addressability as defined by Michael Witmore (2010). Additionally, the paper will report on the work of Enhancing Music notation Addressability (EMA), a NEH-funded one-year project that has developed methods for addressing arbitrary portions of encoded music notation on the web.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the summer of 1530, the empire's elite and the inhabitants of Constantinople gathered at the Hippodrome for the circumcision of Sultan Süleyman's sons Mehmed, Mustafa, and Selim. The celebrations, which lasted for twenty days, included a wide array of activities that extended from the highly formal (such as the ritual kissing of the sultan's hand by the members of the elite) to the carnivalesque (such as the plunder of large quantities of food by the commoners under the eyes of the sultan). The organizers of the event, who were the close collaborators of the sultan, sought to offer different types of entertainment that were tailored to the identities and expectations of various participants. Testimonies by contemporary Ottoman and Venetian observers provide information about these different entertainments, as well as the participants' reactions. The provision of entertainment was a kind of gift on the part of the sultan; at the same time, entertainment was construed as a group activity, through which several individuals and communities contributed to the celebrations. Particular forms of entertainment were seen as befitting specific groups; for instance, there was a class element, which manifested itself in the stark difference between refined and popular entertainments. Laughter, however, often transgressed these boundaries and brought together Ottoman and Venetian, bureaucrat and diplomat, and ship captain and merchant in their reactions to sundry spectacles. In my presentation, I will discuss the social and cultural scale across which different types of entertainment were constructed, adopted, and received/interpreted.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The language of the peasant varies "according to the accidental character of the clergyman, the exciseman, publican, or barber, happened to be, or not be, zealous politicians, and readers of the weekly newspaper pro bono publico," Samuel Taylor Coleridge, contrasting the earlier stance taken with "Mr. Wordsworth" in their Preface to Lyrical Ballads, portrayed the poor here as having no culture or language worth mentioning because of its accidental, arbitrary nature, i.e. shifting nature (qtd. in Smith 225; italics mine). Even Samuel Johnson, titan of the English language that he is, wrote "more ‘permanent' language is written and differs from the language of the ‘laborious and mercantile' classes, which is ‘in a great measure casual and mutable'." (qtd. in Smith 217).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>According to the narrator of Lamia , Philosophy assigns a rainbow a listing "in the dull&amp;#x0D; catalogue of common things. Philosophy will…/Unweave a rainbow" (233237)&amp;#x0D; thus robbing it of any mystery that it once held. Some might ally with Lamia 's narrator, accusing me of&amp;#x0D; "unweaving a rainbow" as I researched the posthumous literary reputation of the Romantic poet&amp;#x0D; John Keats. "Posthumous literary reputation" is the idea that one holds in their mind when they&amp;#x0D; think of a literary figure such as Keats and my research suggested that this concept is a lot like&amp;#x0D; cement: surprisingly fluid at first but, when allowed to settle, resilient and difficult to break.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 19th century is full of intrepid women travelers who left the comfort of home for the sake of some personal or political commitment, the enrichment of travel, or, in some cases, specifically to pursue a profession. Frances Milton Trollope traveled for all three of these reasons. She was always a woman in search of a subject and no place or person was beyond the reach of her rapier pen. Nevertheless, her works are rarely read today and her reputation for literary skill fell short of that of her contemporaries. Only her first book, Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832), is readily available in print today, and only a few of her novels and travel journals are available online. Why then, should one study the life and works of this unusual woman? What insights about 19th century women travelers can be gleaned from a perusal of her work?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars have long assumed that the extent of starvation of mortality on the Soviet home front was not knowable because of the lack of data.  In fact, data from which we can estimate key aspects of starvation mortality are in the archives.  The paper shows that the leading cause of urban civilian mortality on the Soviet home front were starvation and starvation-induced tuberculosis, with the primary victims being males between the ages of 30 and 60.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During World War II the Soviet state introduced draconian penalties for unauthorized job-changing:  between 3 and 8 years in the Gulag.  Although the majority of workers accepted the severe hardships of wartime working and living conditions, a large minority fled their jobs, despite the risks.  In fact, an examination of procuracy data shows that only a small minority of those who fled their jobs were ever caught and punished.  The position became especially critical during 1944, when high rates of flight virtually nullified the impact of successive labour mobilizations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Franz Boas's 1897 monograph, The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians, was a landmark in anthropology for its integrative approach to museum collections, photographs and sound recordings as well as text. A result of participant observation and extensive collaboration with indigenous partners—especially George Hunt—the book set a standard for both ethnography and museum practice. However, both Boas and Hunt remained dissatisfied with the published text, laboring for decades to correct and supplement a volume that would forever mediate global knowledge of the Kwakwaka'wakw. They left behind a vast archive of unpublished materials (ranging from interlinear fieldnotes to watercolour drawings, touched-up photographs to wax cylinder recordings) relevant to the creation and afterlife of this seminal text and its related museum collections. These materials are now widely distributed across institutional, disciplinary, and international borders so that related ethnographic records have become fractured, thereby limiting the documentary potential at each site and the research possibilities for both scholars and indigenous communities. This paper discusses a current collaborative project to create a new, annotated critical edition of the work that unites published and unpublished records with one another and with current Kwakwaka'wakw knowledge in an interactive, multimedia website. Archival revelations about the truly co-authored nature of the original text allow us to better situate the contexts and methods of creating ethnographic knowledge in terms of the indigenous epistemologies it purports to represent. Moreover, new digital technologies can harness multimedia to return sensory richness to Boas and Hunt's synthetic text, to reactivate disparate and long dormant museum collections, and to restore cultural patrimony to its indigenous inheritors.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Franz Boas's 1897 monograph, The Social Organization and Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians, was a landmark in anthropology for its integrative approach to ethnography, the use of multiple media, and the collaborative role of Boas's indigenous partner George Hunt. Not only did the volume draw on existing museum collections from around the world, the two men also left behind a vast and now widely distributed archive of unpublished materials relevant to the creation and afterlife of this seminal text, including hundreds of pages of Hunt's corrections and emendations. This paper discusses an international collaborative project to create a new, annotated critical edition of the book that unites published and unpublished materials with one another and with current Kwakwaka'wakw knowledge in a multimedia online format. The paper will catalogue the range of archival materials at issue and present an interactive prototype for the digital edition that attempts to re-embed ethnographic knowledge within indigenous epistemological frameworks and hereditary protocols for access. While at a preliminary stage of design, working through the functionality and interface of the project prototype during the early research phase has raised key technical, ethical, and theoretical questions about the contexts and methods of collaborative ethnography—and the politics of authority and authorship—both in the original volume and in the newly annotated edition.</Abstract>

Specifically panelists will discuss the interaction between and within Indigenous communities, nation-states, collecting institutions, local and regional communities as they relate to the return and reception of digital materials. These various stakeholders all interact with and have various claims to the preservation and circulation of these cultural materials and the attendant knowledge embedded within them.

		<Abstract>This paper briefly discusses markup, metadata and evaluation issues that arise when projects do not include a critical edition adjudicating different variants, but instead incorporate multiple, full diplomatic transcriptions. When used naively, such corpora will cause duplicate results that are hard to discern in quantitative studies, and in cases of incomplete, unexact or fragmentary parallel witnesses, substantially complicate the decision about what users actually want to have. Using a case study on Coptic manuscripts, the paper suggests that as a provisional strategy, documents should be partitioned as finely grained as necessary such that each section's parallel witness status is encoded, and that for each parallel set, it can be useful to define a redundancy metadatum which identifies the 'best' candidate for quantitative study among the available choices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Coptic language of Hellenistic era Egypt in the first millennium C.E. is a treasure trove of information for History, Religious Studies, Classics, Linguistics and many other Humanities disciplines. Despite the existence of large amounts of text in the language, comparatively few digital resources have been available, and almost no tools for Natural Language Processing. This paper presents an endto-end, freely available open source tool chain starting with Unicode plain text or XML transcriptions of Coptic manuscript data, which adds fully automatic word and morpheme segmentation, normalization, language of origin recognition, part of speech tagging, lemmatization, and dependency parsing at the click of a button. We evaluate each component of the pipeline, which is accessible as a Web interface and machine readable API online.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will analyze the important roles that the early twentieth-century Senegalese political leader Blaise Diagne played in the little-known cosmopolitan and anticolonial resistance of Francophone West Africans in which France played a major part during the first two quarters of the twentieth century.  In an attempt to reveal Diagne's contributions to this Francophone West African and anticolonial resistance tradition which had many intellectual, political, and cultural ramifications, this paper will chart the routes of the Senegalese leader's rise from his upbringing in colonial Senegal to his future emergence as one of the most prominent African anticolonial figures of the early twentieth century.  Drawing from the current scholarships about the black Atlantic intellectual tradition and Black Paris, this essay will interpret archival materials (such as letters, speeches, and newspaper articles) that Diagne wrote in the early twentieth century in order to respond to important issues such as black participation in World War I, the oppression of French colonialism in West Africa, and other issues in which black Atlantic intellectuals such as W.E.B Du Bois and Marcus Garvey were also involved.  By studying the different ways in which Diagne, Du Bois, and Garvey attempted to tackle the above problems through their speeches, correspondences, and articles about one another during the World War I era, my paper will reveal the primary role that Diagne played in the development of a Senegalese intellectual tradition that black Atlantic Studies have so far neglected.  Emphasizing the crucial role that Diagne played in this tradition that has been mostly credited to Western black intellectuals, this paper attempts to break new grounds where the complex writings and history of French African colonies could be properly understood.</Abstract>

In this excerpt, I analyze representations of the "mister goldstein" characters in Pedro Pietri's famous poem, "Puerto Rican Obituary." I then introduce the Puerto Rican writers in the title of my project by examining their connections to Pietri's poem and its representations of its jewish supervisors. I also sketch out historical connections between Puerto Rican and Jewish diasporas going back to the Spanish Inquisition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a 1433 bull issued to the Oblates of Tor de'Specchi, the community of secular religious women founded by Francesca Romana, Pope Eugenius IV approved these women's dedication to charity, their intense penitential commitment, and their desire to live together communally.  However, he stopped short of awarding their way of life a precise canonical status.  While this bull has been seen as a critical part of the establishment of Francesca Romana's community, its role in the papacy's centuries long efforts to corral, contain, and control the great variety of religious vocations taken up by secular Roman women has not been considered.  This paper will explore Eugenius' efforts on behalf of the Oblates in conjunction with other fifteenth-century papal legislation to understand the origins and significance of the curia's interest in establishing the confines of a proper female religious life outside of the convent.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Proposal Abstract: 77% of our student body will never take an ethics course at Montana State University Billings City College. These students enter the workforce and civic society ill-equipped especially in a time of climate change, persistent inequalities, and pandemic. Even so, our institution, like many others, is facing a financial crisis where the humanities have felt the most immediate impact. How then can we meet this need in a time of scarce resources? A mathematician and a writer have joined forces to create a cross-disciplinary, embedded curriculum that is both cost effective and impactful.  During our interactive panel, we will present our National Endowment for the Humanities funded model. Instead of adding credits to our general education core, our department is in the process of binding our disciplines together through embedding ethics education into our core courses: writing, communications, and math. By doing so, we will unify our curriculum, increase our students' ethical reasoning, and create a way to better assess our general education program through eportfolios. We will present an adaptive framework that addresses two fundamental questions: What is an embedded curriculum? How can it be achieved? After briefly situating our institution and our unique goals, we will define what an embedded curriculum is including reasons for its effectiveness and how it differs from a theme-based model. From there, we will describe our process to embed ethics education by engaging the audience through a series of reflective questions within four identifiable challenge categories: faculty insecurities, discipline specific issues, assessment, and institutional challenges.  These challenge categories will help audience members consider their own unique challenges as well as provide us a framework to discuss our own creative solution rooted in a community of practice. With such wide ranging disciplines (i.e. math, English) and the need for unity, we implemented a shar</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Conference schedule; presentation description: The pandemic, global warming, and persistent inequalities highlight the need for a strong general education program. However, higher education’s financial crisis has felt its most immediate impact within the humanities. How can we meet this need in a time of scarce resources? A mathematician and a writer at City College at Montana State University have teamed up to create a cross-disciplinary, embedded ethics curriculum to meet this challenge. During our panel, we will define what an embedded curriculum looks like, including its effectiveness, and help audience members identify challenges and solutions to help achieve this end. In particular, we will emphasize the role of “community of practice” as a process that can unify general education faculty and strengthen core courses through a shared approach. The result: students are better equipped to positively affect society.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>Late Ottoman officials saw the Syrian interior as a vital part of a "national economy" after the fiscal and territorial crises of the 1870s.  This talk introduces interrelated debates over immigration, capital investment, and territorial sovereignty within this framework.  It offers a new historical explanation for the disparate experiences of Anatolia and the Arab provinces before and during World War I, especially with regard to dispossession, displacement and genocide.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Proposal abstract: Many English departments continue to face a decline in student enrollment, institutional funding, and public support. Hence, there has been a push to reimagine the English major. However, any significant curricular revision is time intensive, costly, and fraught with systemic red tape. Furthermore, adding a new set of courses or a new degree track often is dependent on expertise and faculty lines. At Montana State University Billings, we've had a near 50% decline in English majors in recent years (2014-2019) and a similar decrease in tenure/tenure-track lines within our English, Philosophy, and Modern Languages department with no guarantee of adding any new lines. Yet, the need for critical thinking, cultural criticism, and ethical reasoning is at an all-time high considering the pandemic, global warming, and persistent inequalities. How then can we meet this need in a time of scarce resources? I propose an alternative approach by embedding cross-disciplinary outcomes into the English major curriculum. In the last two years, a colleague and I have created a National Endowment for the Humanities funded cross-curricular model initially focused on embedding ethics education into three core general education courses--writing, communication, and math--as a way of unifying our disciplines, increasing our students' ethical reasoning, and creating a better way to assess our general education program through ePortfolios. However, this adaptive framework does not need to be limited to general education. In fact, it could allow English departments greater curricular flexibility while increasing student learning. Faculty can embed a cross-disciplinary outcome within a series of existing courses (i.e., ethics within a series of writing courses, digital humanities within a series of literature courses, or a combination of both) often at the department level without going through the university or system curriculum process.   My interactive presentation...</Abstract>

		<Abstract>James Laidlaw's 1982 article on Christine de Pizan's gifts of her poetry to the Earl of Salisbury and Henry IV of England first asserted that the Epistre Othea in British Library Harley Manuscript 219 was dedicated to Henry, not Charles VI of France. My own recent investigation of Harley 219 is indebted to Laidlaw's work and complements his conclusion from a paleographical angle:  Harley 219 was copied by Thomas Hoccleve, clerk of the Royal Office of the Privy Seal. Hoccleve translated Christine's Epistre au dieu d'Amours into The Letter of Cupid in 1402, likely gaining access through the manuscripts Henry confiscated from Salisbury (Laidlaw 1982). Laidlaw's theory that Christine's work was transmitted from Henry through Hoccleve explains how the sole witness of the royal dedication survives in a rather lackluster manuscript. In this presentation, I reexamine Christine's influence on Hoccleve, arguing that she – through the Epistre au dieu d'Amours, Epistre Othea, and the figure of authorship that she represented – was a chief figure to whom Hoccleve responds throughout his career, from his first effort in Cupid to his last compositions in the Series (1420s). Hoccleve repeatedly presents himself as following in the footsteps of "father Chaucer," but I argue that he owes a much greater debt to Christine than has been acknowledged by scholars thus far.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This contribution to the roundtable demonstrates how we can teach students to analyze Hoccleve's sources and manuscript contexts to evaluate how the Letter of Cupid engages with misogynist tropes and literary texts. The first half shows how Hoccleve's adaptation can productively be read against Christine de Pizan's original French poem to highlight the vivid, coarse, and misogynist language introduced by Hoccleve. The second half offers examples of manuscripts that show that the Letter was transmitted with a range of poems that seem designed to engage gender debates. These include both Hoccleve's own autograph/holograph manuscripts and scribal collections that may include misogynist poems by Lydgate and poems sympathetic to women by Chaucer. My presentation underscores how Hoccleve provocatively turns Christine's pro-woman poem into an ambiguous declaration by Cupid and that even medieval contemporaries were divided on whether Hoccleve's poem should be categorized among pro-woman or antifeminist works.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Geel, a town in Belgium where "boarders" with mental illness or intellectual disabilities live with foster families in their homes, provides one model of community care. In Geel, people with and without disabilities care for each other in family-like communities where needs and abilities change over time. Lauded by the World Health Organization, Geel foster families often stay together for decades and over generations. While Geel's exemplary community care for people with disabilities has been praised, few interviews with boarders have been conducted. I will interview people with intellectual disabilities and mental illness in Geel, Belgium, in order to understand whether and how communities of care at Geel foster agency in people with disabilities—both in foster families and in other social and political associations in the town. I will study whether agency facilitated in foster families leads to agency in other associations, in order to understand the role that cultivating agency in people with mental illness and intellectual disabilities plays in the success of Geel.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Currently, in the United States, citizens are expected to recognize and appreciate the accomplishments of military service members. While all soldiers and veterans have unique experiences, external factors such as the United States' social and political climate affect minority populations in the military differently. Black Americans have served in the U.S. military since the country's earliest wars and have simultaneously been subject to discrimination through slavery, Jim Crow legislation, and the struggle for civil rights. In this poster presentation, I will explore the intersectionality of being African-American military veteran.   The presentation will investigate how the struggle for civil rights affected levels of patriotism, racism in the U.S. military, and the homecoming experiences of Black veterans. I will review academic articles, historical documents, and literary selections to explore the experiences of African-American veterans in three distinct conflicts: The Civil War, Vietnam, and the Global War on Terror. My findings indicate that the continued struggle for equality and freedom at home and unrecognized promises from the U.S. government have persistently plagued Black veterans. Future research on this topic should focus on the homecoming experiences for Black soldiers returning from the recently ended war in Afghanistan and the impact social programs have on assisting Black veterans as they transition back to civilian life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the 1940s, the State Department hired Florence Arquin to take 35mm slides of the art, culture, history, and modern life of Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador. She created an encyclopedic collection of thousands of slides that cover subjects as diverse as colonial churches, indigenous crafts, Modern Mexican painters, and mid-century architecture. Currently held at Florida Atlantic University, these slides are entering a new age, thanks to a Humanities Collections and Reference Resources Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2020. A collaboration between an Art Historian and a Graphic Designer, the Florence Arquin Slide Project will digitize the slides, attach descriptive metadata to the images, and make the resulting database available to the public for research. This jointly-given paper will introduce the project and highlight its contributions to the humanities. Moreover, it will also consider some of the unique challenges presented by the material, as well as the solutions the PIs have discovered along the way. These challenges range from how to map the images so that researchers can search the material geographically, to how and what metadata to translate into Spanish and Portuguese for researchers in Latin America, to how to deal with potentially sensitive material, to copyright issues, to adapting open-source software, to providing access using UX principles.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Community-Oriented Digital Engagement Scholars (CODES) program is a general education pathway for underserved students in all fields and majors at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) and Lewis and Clark Community College (L&amp;amp;C). Enrolled students work alongside community organizations to consider wicked problems and learn how to interact ethically and meaningfully in digital and face-to-face environments. Students take three skills-based courses designed to teach them how to approach a problem using transdisciplinary methods. These skills support their work in research team courses of 8-10 students facilitated by mentoring faculty and community partners. Research teams courses are intentionally organic, transforming each year based on student interest and community need. Teams analyze, visualize, and share their work with the broader public using skills central to the digital humanities, including data mining, mapping, storytelling, networking, and cultural analytics. The CODES sequence culminates with the completion of digital collaborative projects during a credit-bearing summer research experience before the third year.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Norwich Humanities Initiative (NHI) is a university-wide General Education curriculum and programming initiative developed to increase the visibility and engagement with the Humanities at Norwich University, a goal that aligns with the university's 200-year-old vision of fostering citizen scholars. This initiative was founded in 2018 with support of a $35,000 Humanities Connections planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). In Spring 2020, we received two three-year Implementation Grants from the NEH and the Davis Educational Foundation totaling $240,000 to expand and institutionalize the initiative.  Our poster presentation will provide examples of how the NHI supports inclusive and collaborative interdisciplinary student learning opportunities, professional development opportunities for faculty, and programming with internal and external partners with specific emphasis on the Humanities. We will highlight the development and success of our team-taught "Topics in Interdisciplinary Humanities" courses, including Narrative Medicine, Geoarchaeology of Lost Cities, and True Crime, developed to fulfill General Education Humanities requirements. We will also offer examples of pedagogical workshops, student research fellowships, and experiential learning opportunities currently under development. Finally, we will share assessment results from our partnership with the National Humanities Alliance (NHA) to demonstrate how the initiative has produced significant learning outcomes, enhanced students' capacity to make connections across distinct areas of study, and increased students' appreciation of liberal education and its professional, social, and civic value.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Overlooked Organics in Decorative Arts: Cataloguing Winterthur's Hard Matrices and Collagen-Based Organics  In 2018 Winterthur Museum, Garden &amp;amp; Library was awarded an NEH grant to catalogue "overlooked organic" objects in the collection through physical identification and analytical research. Before scarcity and synthetic materials supplanted them, natural components sourced from the animal kingdom were plentiful in the decorative arts. These objects, created from hard matrices and collagen-based organics by artists whose craft traditions are scarcely practiced today, are culturally, historically, and artistically important. This project focuses on cataloguing a group of objects with a high standard of accuracy, acquiring information through visual and scientific analysis, research, and expert consultation. The work is a collaboration between curatorial, conservation, and scientific staff to understand findings within the craft context for each object.  The project's main objective is to make the animal organics more accessible through accurate and full catalogue records including creation context, photography, condition information, materials identification, and web descriptions. Where visual identification is inconclusive, peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) is providing a species identification, to varying degrees of certainty, based upon existing reference data. This technique, which involves MALDI-ToF analysis of enzyme-digested microsamples, required a new set of skills and knowledge from the two Winterthur scientists. An introduction to and continued guidance of the PMF technique and interpretation has been provided by Dr. Dan Kirby, an independent conservation research scientist affiliated with MFA Boston. MALDI-ToF instrumentation is accessed at the University of Delaware's mass spectrometry facility.   While some objects are easily sampled and produce good data to be interpreted by the non-expert user, others are more challenging. Shagreen objects are provin</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Event abstract:  The study of political economy and capitalism in the Islamic world is attracting renewed attention among the region's specialists. Whereas groundbreaking work in this field in the 1970s was largely inspired by quantitative and/or Marxist approaches, recent work seeks to incorporate the cultural and global turns, including a large body of work on social transformation in the Middle East since "early modernity." Yet the heterodoxy of the "new history of capitalism" has raised questions as to what defines this turn as a research agenda.  This event brings historians of diverse concentrations together, including scholars of China and the Indian Ocean. The conversations are divided into four sessions. Each session highlights a salient theme that has preoccupied historians - typically working outside the field of Middle Eastern Studies - associated with the new history of capitalism and cognate fields.  Panel abstract: This is a definitions-meets-pedagogy panel that asks participants to share how they might teach big questions about capitalism and the history of capitalism in the Middle East to undergraduate students and/or to a public audience. While there is a substantial literature surrounding these big questions, we are more curious about how we may translate these into concrete terms in our teaching.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk discussed the creation of an Ottoman national economy especially in the realm of property relations in Syria.  Codified law that stipulated the dispossession of populations deemed unproductive was an important element of national economy production in the late Ottoman context, and the Syrian interior was no exception.  However, capitalist expansion was limited in the  case of Ottoman property relations by concerns over foreign land ownership and maintaining imperial sovereignty.  The talk also discussed the  ways local actors were able to avoid or actively resist dispossession both in and out of court by taking advantage of the tension between capitalist expansion and imperial sovereignty, producing uneven patterns of land registration and tenure across Syria.</Abstract>

Host-guest metaphors are used to assert power and leverage both domestically and internationally by exerting sovereign control over a post-imperial nation-space, performing neo-imperial guardianship over the downtrodden (especially within the Muslim umma), and claiming an ethno-religious, civilizational morality that exceeds the legalistic logic of human rights and entitlements.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For decades, the organic materials study collection at the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation (WUDPAC) has played a pivotal role in teaching. It has grown over time to include numerous examples of plant- and animal-based materials in their raw and worked states, along with an array of rubbers and plastics. For students, being able to examine and physically handle these materials enhances learning, often in profound ways. This talk will further explore how the study collection has impacted education and outreach, both within and beyond WUDPAC, and discuss the ways in which our approaches to using, organizing, and adding to it have evolved throughout the history of the program. It will also consider the importance of such study collections not only for teaching about material properties and traditions of use but in fostering a greater sense of connection to the natural world and raising awareness of critical environmental issues.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Speech surrogacy is a well-documented phenomenon in West Africa, celebrated as an indigenous means of long-distance communication. In The World and Africa, W. E. B. Du Bois wrote: "The development of the drum language by intricate rhythms enabled the natives not only to lead in dance and ceremony, but to telegraph all over the continent with a swiftness and precision hardly rivaled by the electric telegraph (1947)." Amanda Villepastour has updated Du Bois's analogy to the telegraph, referring to the Yorùbá practice of Batá drumming as "ancient text messages" (2010). Despite nearly a century of academic study, the full nuance of speech-to-music mappings is only recently becoming known through computational analysis, such as Seifart's study of Amazonian Bora drumming. Seifart revealed minute variations in speech rhythm were preserved in slit drum interpretations (et al. 2018). Through careful comparison of phonetic and musical features, scholars may understand the depth of the cross-domain mapping, developing a phonological explanation of how surrogate speech is communication and the cognitive and physical limitations in different contexts. This 90-minute workshop will include live demonstrations of computer-assisted annotation and analysis of field recordings by an ethnomusicologist, linguist, and music theorist. The workshop leaders will present current methods applied to recent recordings from fieldwork in Mali and Nigeria funded by the National Endowment of the Humanities and National Science Foundation. Software covered will include ELAN, MATLAB, and Melodyne. Indigenous concepts and metalanguage for surrogacy drawn from ethnography will inform discussion of the validity of the analytical methods presented.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An Extension of the Self:  The Translinguistic Practices of Puerto Ricans Online  Abstract This paper provides a descriptive analysis of bilingual language practices in online platforms by Puerto Rican youth. We follow the practices of two social networks (Milroy and Llamas, 2013) of Puerto Ricans and qualitatively detail how different technological platforms are shaping the way youth orient to themselves through ideological language constructs (Spanish, English) and more nuanced aspects of their repertoire (textspeak registers, non-binary language, symbols). In this sense, we portray a Puerto Rican bilingual who draws on a diverse range of semiotic practices, challenging previous notions of Puerto Ricans as adhering to Spanish-dominant practices alone. Therefore, we project an image of an island bilingual that is multimodal and literate in different Englishes, Spanishes and in-between contact styles. Data are gathered from popular social media applications (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) as well as text-messaging applications (WhatsApp, iMessage), for a total of 500 screenshots. By incorporating a multimodal perspective (Bezemer and Kress, 2015) to interpreting bilingual speech, the Puerto Rican bilingual is positioned as a translingual communicator, influenced by their everyday investments in society (e.g., social practices), social circumstances (e.g., education, socioeconomic status, gender identity), as well as the mediatization that has transformed traditional boundaries of the so-called "speech community" (Jacquemet, 2019). Findings from this paper further illuminate the nature of languages in modern day Puerto Rico, particularly among the youth (Morales Lugo, 2019, 2020), making room for an additional narrative that envisions the smartphone as an extension of the human body. The findings from this paper are part of a larger study of documenting languages in the Puerto Rican youth, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (HB-273677-21).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session explores and highlights the collaborative opportunities between libraries, archives, and museums. In 2022 Archivist Trista Raezer-Stursa (MSUM), Chelsea Olmsted (Legacy of the Lakes Museum), and librarian Susanne Caro (NDSU) collaborated on Staying Above Water; Fargo-Moorhead floods, an NEH funded exhibit. The exhibit presents different flood events and the community response as part of the larger exhibit Disasters; the stories we share. The panel will describe the collaborative process and how it benefited from a diversity of collections and experience. The session would also cover the inspiration behind the theme and motivation to collect and exhibit stories through a widely accessible platform. By asking participating sites to contribute their own local disaster narratives that became part of the community identity and shared history, the online ArcGIS map creates a new avenue of stories available at any computer user's fingertips.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This will be a preliminary survey of how infertility, in both men and women, was discussed in the Arabic medical commentaries on the Canon of Medicine and its abridgment, the Epitome. These texts and their commentaries were the mainstay of Arabic medical education from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries, and were well-known to and frequently cited in the works of religious scholars and belles-lettrists. Having a firm grasp of this tradition thus is essential to understanding the persistence and changes in understandings of and practices associated with infertility in post-classical Islamic societies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1954 approximately 100,000 former Russian émigrés and their children voluntarily repatriated from China to the Soviet Union. This paper, which draws on the second to the last chapter of my monograph-in-progress, From China to the U.S.S.R.: The Return of the "True" Russians, focuses on the interactions after 1954 between Harbintsy repatriates and the minority of Harbintsy who chose instead to migrate further (most went to Australia). During the Soviet period some repatriates corresponded with their friends and relatives abroad, and a few visits occurred. After 1991, this contact increased substantially, including at massive Harbintsy reunions held in Russia. After 1991 repatriates also began to enunciate how they, in contrast to "local" Russians (those born in the Soviet Union), were "real" Russians because they had been born and raised in a "replica" of Imperial Russia. Harbintsy abroad, meanwhile, had remained a distinct group within the Russian emigration, but they had still been exposed to a similar Russian émigré national identity. Yet when they reunited the two groups of Harbintsy often argued over who constituted a "true" Russian. Repatriates cited the importance of language, while Harbintsy abroad cited Russian Orthodoxy. Many Harbiners abroad insisted that repatriates admit they had made a mistake, while many repatriates pitied Harbiners abroad for not living in their historic homeland. Yet their love of Harbin united the two, and encouraged a global multi-ethnic identity as "Harbintsy," bolstered by the return trips many made to China and the choice by many to consider Harbin their homeland. This paper sheds light on contemporary Russian national identity, intradiasporal tensions, and the challenges to ethnic return migration. It is based on the repatriate and émigré press, over eighty oral interviews, and on thousands of unpublished letters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the conclusion of his translation of Stephen Gardiner's De vera obedientia (1553), the bibliographer John Bale promised a new edition William Tyndale's response to Henry VIII's first divorce, The Practice of Prelates. It would have contained Bale's "augmentacions." This edition never appeared, but Bale made good use of Tyndale's ideas on church history and theology throughout his career. This subject has so far eluded scholarly discussion, apart from one dated essay by Rainer Pineas. By reviewing Bale's reading of Tyndale's books, and tracing his use of Tyndale's ideas in his own publications, this paper will argue that much of Bale's distinctive polemical style, trenchant tone, and vivid satirical imagery is borrowed from Tyndale. The analysis counters the imbalanced focus upon Tyndale's biblical translations within Tyndale studies, and refocuses Bale's reading of Tyndale's publications as a means to understand the development of radical ideas in early Tudor England.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1913, the renowned author Yi Kwangsu adapted two Japanese translations of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). Borrowing the language of the Japanese colonizer, Yi uses US slavery to help Koreans enhance their understanding of oppression and liberation. But while encouraging sympathy for the enslaved, Yi typifies African Americans as inferior victims to deliberately counteract Koreans' own subaltern status. This paper examines the Korean reworking of US domestic fiction under Japanese rule in order to trace how American notions of the human migrated to Asia. Yi subtly contests the Japanese empire; however, his belief in civilization and enlightenment legitimates Western and Japanese domination by dehumanizing the black race and alienating the Asian race. Yi's act of depicting blackness in sentimental terms has its promises and liabilities. Although it animates an emotional identification between African Americans and Koreans, it entails a self-othering by Koreans and their othering of the racial Other in the formation of colonial modernity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines Korean translations of Langston Hughes's short fiction in the 1930s to trace Hughes's inspiration for the willful violation of social order. In the mid-1930s when Korea was under Japanese rule (1910-1945), Yi Jong-su introduced Hughes's leftist vision to a Korean audience by translating "Mother and Child" and "Cora Unashamed." The medium of the magazine facilitated this global dissemination of Hughes. The act of translating pieces from contemporaneous non-Japanese-language periodicals was Korean intellectuals' deliberate means to keep abreast of proletarian developments in other countries while redressing Korea's reliance on the colonizer's cultural resources. By focusing on Hughes's depictions of African American workers and their interracial relationships, Yi encouraged Korean readers to imagine living otherwise when adhering to the system of oppression and exploitation was the normative condition. Yi's subversive practice of translation expands Hughes's radicalism as manifested in racial and sexual transgression.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Taking chapter 23 ("On Education") of Louise Dupin's Work on Women as an example, I focus on manuscript features that disappear in printed books:  the play of hands that inform us about the process of collaboration from note-taking to final draft; the modular organization of the work-in-progress through a system of loose-leaf folios that could be moved among folders; and the evolving overall architecture of the work as evidenced by the reordering of articles. These observations beg the question of what we are doing when we study the manuscripts of neglected, unpublished, and therefore unknown texts. If the manuscript to a printed text is the backstory to the story, what is a manuscript that never made it to print (the final form of so much writing by early modern women)—particularly a manuscript like Dupin's, of which no part was circulated?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through her survey of women's freedom and authority around the world, and of the labor they share with men, Dupin was perhaps the first to engage in feminist recovery work on a global scale. She condemns slavery and looks for examples of ordinary women's agency in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Yet we know that Dupin's personal wealth was built in part on investments in the slave trade made by her father and husband, and she conveniently ignores that the labor she praises in women "in the colonies" is coerced. This paper considers Dupin as an example of the "White Feminism" that Rafia Zakaria traces to the Enlightenment, before reflecting on the sterility of canceling a woman who chose not to publish her work in anticipation of being the target of the misogyny she observes in social settings.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeology in the Middle East has involved, for more than 200 years, foreign-led excavations hiring teams of site workers from the local communities in the region. These locally-hired laborers have carried out the bulk of the shoveling, sifting, and dirt-hauling for most of the archaeological work in the region, but rarely appear in publications or even excavation archives. Their expertise and their perspectives on Middle Eastern archaeology have largely disappeared. But through a combination of ethnographic work, social network analysis, and emancipatory photography, Dr. Mickel will present some ways of seeing the often-invisible knowledge that local laborers possess about the archaeological work which has relied on them for so long. These strategies also suggest how anthropologist might adjust excavation methods to be more inclusive, and therefore more produce a more accurate and thorough archaeological record.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Activists and scholars promoting Open Access (OA) in academic research have been called, at times, anticorporate or communist, and at others, neoliberal or hypercapitalist-- by different writers concerned with the same issue: preventing the exploitation of academic labor. At issue is the question of whether open access poses more of a challenge to the for-profit publishing industry or to academics' control over the products of their work and effort. The ability to see open access at both ends of this spectrum is due, I argue, to a number of indeterminacies: how precarious academics actually are, the disciplinary differences in what access should be opened, and even the very definition of "open access" as a term. Most of all, though, the disparate framing of OA's effects on academic labor appears to be rooted in three different concepts of "research:" first, as a good, second, as a service, and third, as a "goodly service"-- that is, a moral and even charitable act. In this paper, I trace these three concepts through the literature on OA advocacy and critique, illustrating how each one points to a particular future for OA and its relationship to academic labor. With this framework in mind, I argue that movements toward OA in archaeology must contend with the ways in which archaeological data is labor-in-process in order to protect against potential exploitative consequences forewarned by OA skeptics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Allison Mickel is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology in the Department of Sociology &amp;amp; Anthropology, and Assistant Director of Global Studies, at Lehigh University. Her research focuses on how local communities have impacted and been affected by the long history of archaeological work in the Middle East. She has excavated in Jordan, Turkey, Kenya, and the United States. Her first book, Archaeologists as Authors and the Stories of Sites: Defending the Use of Fiction in Archaeological Writing, focused on the politics of representation and public engagement in publications about archaeology. Her new book, Why Those Who Shovel are Silent: A History of Local Archaeological Labor and Knowledge, is out now and examines the ways in which the economics of labor management and the epistemology of archaeology are intertwined. Mickel was recently awarded a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities to undertake an ethnographic project centering on two new private companies in Jordan advocating for the recognition of local expertise and fair labor conditions on archaeological excavations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Early archaeologists, especially those working in the Near East, have always relied heavily on the skills and knowledge of locally-hired laborers. Even in the present, projects in Egypt and Iraq continue to employ the descendants of the highly capable, insightful, and often innovative men and women employed by archaeological expeditions in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Still, despite their importance for the success of archaeological projects, locally-hired laborers have almost never contributed to the documentation of archaeological sites. In fact, they are rarely even identifiable by name in publications and archives, leaving in question the precise ways in which archaeological excavation has relied on their abilities and information. Ethnography and oral history can help to uncover the contours and contributions of local expertise, but as with any act of uncovering, we may find things we do not anticipate—in particular, the ways in which labor management practices in Near Eastern archaeology have worked to reward local communities for hiding, rather than sharing, their knowledge about archaeological remains. In this seminar, Mickel argues that rethinking how we recruit, pay, and direct workers on archaeological projects will be essential to engaging communities, exchanging expertise, and ultimately learning more about the past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since the 1990's, a great deal of scholarly attention in archaeology has focused on our relationships to public, descendant, and local communities. Much has been written on the obligations that archaeologists have to those interested in and affected by our work, and within this body of literature, there is a theme of needing to hand over much control over the stewardship of the past to the communities that live in and around archaeological sites. This is particularly true in postcolonial contexts. For the past three years, I have been conducting an ethnography of two Jordanian startups aiming to respond to this "local turn" by developing business practices that build local capacity for heritage preservation and management. In this presentation, I present preliminary findings suggesting that the founders of these companies have been most successful when they are able to fluidly perform local and outsider identities, rather than one or the other. I argue that this is not simply about language fluency or class markers, but is in fact reflective of the economy of the global heritage industry. These findings challenge the ease, simplicity, and value of discussing local community empowerment within critical heritage studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In recent years, large transnational organizations working in cultural heritage and sustainable development have seemingly united with academics, professionals, and grassroots communities in calling for greater engagement on the part of local and vulnerable communities. Almost uniformly, best practices across these sectors state that local communities should be active participants in determining the future of the sites where they live. But much criticism of development and the global heritage regime aims at the frequent failure, on the ground, to meaningfully engage and empower local communities in decision-making and implementation processes. This paper starts differently-- by looking at the successes of two startup corporations in Jordan working to increase Jordanian involvement and agency over Jordan's cultural heritage, documented over five years of ethnographic fieldwork. I argue that these companies have been effective in securing funding and opportunities in cultural heritage when they have emphasized their "vulnerable" identity. In grant applications and pivotal meetings, the founders of these companies laid claim to the impoverishment and disappearing traditions of their Bedouin communities. At the same time, however, these companies relied on their connections with American and European archaeologists to satisfy the bureaucratic expectations of the international heritage regime. These companies' creative navigation through the many barriers to substantive community involvement lays bare how communities must satisfy opposed requirements in order to be legible for the purposes of "community engagement:" on the one hand, capable and cosmopolitan but on the other, underprivileged and vulnerable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the bodily sensations provided to virtual visitors to the Church of Saint Polyeuktos in Constantinople. An integral component of the church was a long, 41-line epigram. A virtual simulation of the interior space allows virtual visitors to experience the interaction between the viewer, the epigram, and the interior of the church. The paper will demonstrate the utility of virtual simulation for the purpose of more deeply understanding matronage along with the somatic experience of Constantinopolitan church visitors, both elite and non-elite, from the 6th-13th centuries.</Abstract>

Unlike the current Met Cloisters, which combine architecture from multiple medieval sites into one, Barnard's Cloisters were an enterprise in medievalism. By inviting participants into a space rather than merely showing it, the technology complements real-world walking itineraries that bodily engage participants with the multifarious medieval layers of the city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Creating and using immersive experiences to study the past has been shown to develop certain responses in users including empathy and engagement. These responses have also proven to be stronger and more effective at changing mindsets than other more traditional communicative methods, such as writing and reading. Thus, as we create 3D worlds to study and teach the medieval past, what are our responsibilities to those who will use these technologies? Particularly around human representation, how are we to approach digital construction of medieval societies without evoking undesirable responses (nationalism, sexism, racism) in users? This paper will look at the pros and cons of various approaches to the use of digital human bodies in virtual environments, providing concrete examples of digital avatars and suggestions for the research and construction of digital humans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public health was vital to the success of the American pacification campaign and the civilizing process in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. In 1905, American colonial authorities established a leper colony in Culion, an isolated island in Palawan. Victor Heiser, Director of Health in the Philippines from 1905 to 1915, declared that to ensure public health, it was necessary to isolate lepers; this meant, in many instances, forcibly removing them from their homes and relocating them to Culion. But how did individuals who were suspected of having leprosy respond to Heiser during his "leper collecting trips" throughout the country? What was life like for those who were brought to Culion, and how did they engage with government authorities over such issues as the segregation of patients by gender and the ban on cohabitation and marriage? &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This paper seeks to advance our understanding of Filipino leprosy patients' engagement with American colonial authorities, an understudied theme in the literature on empire and public health policy, and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Most scholarship on Culion emphasizes Culion's role as a laboratory for civic experimentation and how it was embroiled in major political issues of the day. Here, the patients appear as objects of colonial policies and of both anti-and pro-independence rhetoric by American and Filipino government officials. In this paper, I consider the views and practices of leprosy patients to show how they challenged their forced removal from their homes and the gender segregation within the leper colony.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing on five years of ethnographic research with Army personnel, active duty and veteran, and their families in Colorado Springs, this paper illustrates how soldiers and family members navigate mental health care through a web of institutions: Army medical services, Tri-Care insurance, the Veterans Administration, civilian providers, and community-based organizations. These institutions and providers have different and often conflicting priorities and models of health and illness. Military providers and leaders must integrate generating mental health, expressed as resilience, with the need to put "boots on the ground." They must manage conflicts between the warrior ethos, in which mental suffering represents weakness and defeat, and the need for soldiers to access treatment. The Veterans Administration and Tri-Care are necessarily concerned with treating mental illness and ensuring that patients receive evidence-based care. In contrast, community-based providers and organizations seek to assist military personnel with reintegration into civilian life following deployments or leaving military service for which evidence of effectiveness may be more individualized and elusive. Constrained by the institutional focus on treatment of disease, soldiers, their families and civilian providers and agencies nonetheless exercise individual and institutional agency to assist military personnel and families with a variety of needs related to reintegration: from practical issues of housing, employment, education, and adaptive housing, to re-establishing intimate relationships and spiritual and moral healing. High levels of suicide, substance use, and homelessness among veterans attest to the skill and support required to navigate this complex terrain and the health disparities that ensue when they cannot.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>If recycling is a harbinger of a more sustainable society, then the lead-acid battery industry offers an apparent model of success.  In the United States, more than 95 percent of lead-acid batteries are recycled. The battery industry describes this "closed loop" as the "environmental success story of our time."  But there is a catch: this is not actually new.  The lead industry has been recovering lead from spent batteries on an industrial scale since the 1920s.  This presentation will consider how this system has evolved historically:  How have the stocks and flows of lead changed over time?  Where have the greatest threats to human and environmental health emerged?  How has the lead-acid battery system and those risks been affected by environmental policy, changes in scientific assessments related to the risks of lead exposure, and the activism of national and community-based organizations?  Considering the environmental history of lead-acid batteries reveals a complex and volatile industry shaped by dramatic swings in recycling rates historically, with disproportionate impacts on specific communities.  More recently, tightening EPA regulations have pushed lead-acid recycling activities abroad, with consequences for human and environmental health that belie any simplistic claims about "environmental success."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Building on archival research made possible through the National Endowments for the Humanities (NEH) and American Historical Association's (AHA) "Bridging Cultures at Community Colleges: American History, Atlantic and Pacific" three-year initiative, I organized a panel which highlighted three unique groups of transnational travelers exploring the Pacific during the nineteenth century:  Japanese female immigrants, American missionary children, and British female adventurers. Panelists analyzed and explored the stories of each of these groups and their influence on the wider Pacific world in multimedia presentations. By juxtaposing their experiences throughout the Pacific with the societies they encountered, panelists elaborated on the ways in which multiple cultural ideologies and practices were transmitted and shared, as well as the impact such encounters had within the nineteenth century</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2011, the U.S. alkaline battery industry made a surprising announcement:  it aimed to launch a national program to recycle the billions of AA, AAA, 9-volt, and other alkaline batteries in the United States.  It was a surprising turnabout for an industry that as late as 2000 had publicly opposed any efforts to promote recycling.  To understand this reversal requires engaging with two interrelated narratives.  First, is the longer history of the battery industry's efforts to detoxify batteries, specifically by removing mercury from alkaline cells.  Indeed, as late as the 1980s, batteries accounted for .005% of the municipal waste stream by weight, but approximately 50% of mercury waste.  Getting the mercury out of batteries was a significant environmental achievement for the industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s in response to new environmental policies and advances in hydrometallurgical technology (which entailed new environmental costs).  Second, a new push for product stewardship, justified by life-cycle analyses, sparked a renewed push for recycling in the 2000s, first in Europe and then the United States.  This marked a change, because since the early 1990s, the industry had publicly argued against recycling batteries, since they were non-toxic.  To understand the significance of this turn toward battery recycling requires engaging with the history of existing mining, waste, and recycling infrastructure: How do existing systems of waste management and metals processing in Europe and the U.S. affect the efficiency of battery recycling?  Why has a mining industry that has proven so adept at extracting a wide array of minerals from ever lower-grade ore, struggled to extract those same metals from the stream of spent batteries?  This paper deploys an envirotechnical approach -- drawing on environmental history and history of technology -- to consider the historical intersection of technology, policy, environment, and economy to answer these questions</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The HathiTrust holds one of the largest collections of digitized published work in the world. With nearly 14 million volumes ("Currently Digitized", HathiTrust.org), it is a challenge to create mechanisms to understand and interpret a collection of this size. The HathiTrust+Bookworm (HT+BW) project presents ways to behold that textual content through interactive visualization. In this poster, we present new work from HT+BW in applying visualization as an complementary, rather than center, tool for supporting better comprehension of large collections. Whereas HT+BW has previously been used in standalone contexts with pre-determined metadata, we present work in two new areas: 1) allowing scholars to analyze custom personal collections from within the larger corpus; and 2) use of HT+BW as a supplement to other uses of the HathiTrust Research Center.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The changes in the defining ideas of the&amp;#x0D; contemporary world, the exponential growth of knowledge, and&amp;#x0D; the expansion of technological innovations have created a need&amp;#x0D; for a critical examination of the convergences and connections&amp;#x0D; between the sciences, engineering, and the humanities. Today,&amp;#x0D; there are areas of study so complex that they go beyond confines&amp;#x0D; of a single discipline. Examples of such areas include (1) the&amp;#x0D; comparative study of concepts of mind, consciousness, and&amp;#x0D; machines, (2) the critique of the technological culture through&amp;#x0D; appropriate and alternative technology approaches, and (3) the&amp;#x0D; questions surrounding cosmology, evolution, and beliefs.&amp;#x0D; In response to this, we have developed interdisciplinary, teamtaught,&amp;#x0D; general education courses on artificial intelligence,&amp;#x0D; appropriate technology, and the origins of the universe that&amp;#x0D; respond to the above challenges, while fostering the ability of our&amp;#x0D; students to use skill sets and concepts from different and&amp;#x0D; divergent disciplines in order to examine such complex areas of&amp;#x0D; study. In this paper, we will present the interdisciplinary courses&amp;#x0D; developed for the first year experience that integrate humanities,&amp;#x0D; engineering, psychology, biology, and physics, as well as the&amp;#x0D; associated strategies for interdisciplinary teamwork and&amp;#x0D; techniques used in the courses. The preliminary results indicate&amp;#x0D; that, while there is a need for continuous retooling of the course&amp;#x0D; model to better reflect the General Education goals and the&amp;#x0D; university culture, this is a successful course model for our&amp;#x0D; institution. They also indicate that the students' engagement and&amp;#x0D; critical thinking and integrative skills improved. The data also&amp;#x0D; suggests that this type of interdisciplinary intervention in the&amp;#x0D; beginning years of university study positively impacts the&amp;#x0D; development of students' abilities in these areas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite the 75 year history of Warner Bros.' global cinemas, the company's expansive circuit remains largely forgotten. "Warner Worldwide" contrasts the company's 20th century desire to secure key "shop window" cinemas in Europe and Latin America for Warner Bros. films with the company's explosive growth in China during the 21st century that eventually ran afoul of local policies and politicians and led to the closure of Warners' Chinese cinemas and the end of the company's exhibition operations after 75 years. By examining Warner Bros.' historical and contemporary theater chains and investments, "Warner Worldwide" reinforces the importance of studying theatrical exhibition for understanding how global distribution has been enabled by Hollywood's operation and investments in local cinemas and chains and why, after 75 years, the company decided to end its theatrical operations abroad amid overbuilt markets, local opposition, and a changing digital landscape for film distribution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public health was vital to the success of the American pacification campaign and the civilizing process in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. In 1907, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. 1711, which mandated the compulsory segregation and isolation of leprosy patients to the island of Culion in Palawan. Victor Heiser, Director of Health from 1905 to 1915, declared that to protect public health it was necessary to isolate lepers; this meant, in many instances, forcibly removing them from their homes and relocating them to Culion. Health authorities had downplayed Filipino leprosy patients' opposition to the segregation order. Heiser authoritatively claimed the "collection of lepers" proceeded smoothly. When compared to the population of the Culion leper colony within a given year, the number of "absconders" was small. Although this number may seem small and insignificant, it renders invisible a wide array of responses the segregation policy generated among the Filipino leprosy patients and suspected lepers – men and women, young and old, rich and poor alike.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This paper is part of my larger project on the social history of leprosy patients in Culion during the American colonial period. It advances our understanding of the engagement between Filipino leprosy patients and colonial authorities. This is an understudied theme in the literature on empire and public health policy and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Earlier studies of Culion highlight its role as a laboratory for civic experimentation and how it was embroiled in major political issues of the day. Drawing on a wide array of sources including government reports, personal papers of colonial officials, and letters of leprosy patients and their families, this paper demonstrates how Filipino leprosy patients and suspected lepers challenged a public health program that, as scholars have pointed out, served as rationale for "America's imperialist venture" in the Philippines.</Abstract>

Anchoring a building in the city's history all but guarantees that it will be more efficiently integrated into the public realm.  Acceptance and appreciation increases for occupants, but also for the public, who may never enter the building. Providing this history is an act of civic generosity and a powerful instrument for change.  Talk given to a private group of international real estate investors.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For decades, in some cases centuries, Cape Verdeans suppressed discussion or even knowledge of their Jewish ancestry -- often in order to avoid anti-Semitism.  For a variety of reasons, in recent years many Cape Verdeans (both on and off the islands) have begun exploring their (individual and collective) Jewish heritage and developing a variety of ways to revisit their spiritually mixed identities.  In this talk, I explore these links.  I base my remarks on both formal interviews and informal participant-observation conducted in Portugal, Cape Verde, and the U.S.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this presentation, Professor Sobol will introduce her book project that examines the Gothic elements in Russian literature (mysterious castles, ruins, haunted landscapes, ghosts, persecuted maidens, etc.) in their imperial context. While the predilection for Gothic tropes in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Russian literature has been typically interpreted as a tribute to the fashionable Western trend, Haunted Empire argues that, instead, Russian Gothic fiction was a key literary form that dramatized deep historical and cultural tensions unique to the Russian imperial situation: a peculiar symbiosis of the imperial and national identities; blurred boundaries between the subjects and objects of colonization and imperial dominance; and instability of the relationship between center and periphery. This study applies the "North/South" geocultural axis, typical of British Gothic literature, to the particularly Russian situation where the Finnish/Baltic "North" and the Ukrainian "South" figure as colonized Others that are paradoxically integral to Russia's own mythology of origins. Through specific literary examples, Prof. Sobol will demonstrate that, in the Russian Gothic, the empire's Northern and Southern borderlands are consistently depicted as dangerous uncanny places that destabilize the characters' imperial and national identities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The unfinished and untitled text now known as Jean Santeuil was begun by Proust in&amp;#x0D; 1895 and largely abandoned by the end of 1899. Proust had misgivings about the text's generic&amp;#x0D; status: ‘Puis-je appeler ce livre un roman ?,' he writes in an unlabeled, incomplete manuscript&amp;#x0D; page that stops mid-sentence. Bernard de Fallois, the editor of the first published version (1952), tidied up Proust's disorderly manuscript into a narrative that followed the conventions of a novel of formation. A later version edited by Pierre Clarac (1971) attempted to restitute some the fragmentary nature of the text, but largely maintained Fallois's reorderings. As noted by Jean-Yves Tadié in his update of Clarac's version (2001), a complete critical edition of Jean Santeuil remains to be done. Proust's strikethroughs and revisions, most notably, are not fully transcribed in any published version; the recent digitization of the manuscript (2014) makes them visible for the first time.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The manuscript reveals the young Proust's hesitations in matters of gender as well as&amp;#x0D; genre, particularly around questions of reading and desire. Love scenes are rewritten to erase&amp;#x0D; hints of gender ambiguity. Scenes of shared reading – precursors to the solitary reading scenes in&amp;#x0D; À la recherche du temps perdu – can be dated to 1895, when Proust was enamored with the&amp;#x0D; composer Reynaldo Hahn, since these sections of the manuscript are written on the same paper&amp;#x0D; used by Proust and Hahn to write letters in the fall of that year. Considering Jean Santeuil less as a novel than as a composite text, alongside Proust and Hahn's letters, allows for unexpected&amp;#x0D; insight into the Proustian theory of reading, through its links to Proust's experiences and&amp;#x0D; conceptions of queerness. By undoing earlier editorial efforts toward generic purity and returning to the manuscript, we uncover a different text, and a different way of reading Proust.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Maya hieroglyphic script and the degree of its visual complexity have proven challenging for standard script-encoding approaches to be applied. A multidisciplinary collaboration established between UC Berkeley's Script Encoding Initiative and the University of Bonn's MAAYA Project aims to employ new methods combining linguistics, Maya epigraphy, digital palaeography and computer vision to overcome some of the major challenges preventing the encoding of Maya hieroglyphs in the Unicode Standard.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Encoding the Maya hieroglyphs in Unicode would allow creation of vast open-access Maya hieroglyphic text repositories and libraries, where advanced search and query functionalities and text-mining could be applied. As a result, the ability to render any Maya hieroglyphic text in Unicode could impact the overall accessibility, reproduction, visualization and long-term preservation of the sum of ancient knowledge recorded by the Maya scribes on thousands of texts and inscriptions produced between ca. 250 BC and 1450 AD in Central America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past 30 years, developments in computing mean that almost every script and writing&amp;#x0D; system ever created can be coded on a computer, used on Facebook, mobile phones and in&amp;#x0D; emails, and large numbers of documents can be encoded, searched and archived in a range of&amp;#x0D; different scripts.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In South and Southeast Asia, there are a large number of different scripts, some used by quite&amp;#x0D; small communities. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Since the earlier part of this century, a great effort has been made to encode all of these&amp;#x0D; scripts in the Unicode, a standard that allows for the encoding of any symbols used in writing&amp;#x0D; that can be demonstrated to be in use, or to have been in use in the past. However, negotiating&amp;#x0D; a script into the Unicode is a complex issue, involving considerable technical expertise and&amp;#x0D; knowledge of script encoding principles, things that are difficult enough for an academic&amp;#x0D; linguist but virtually impenetrable for members of the speech communities.&amp;#x0D; Combining our expertise in both script encoding and in linguistics, we will raise issues of&amp;#x0D; community involvement in the process by means of several case studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My paper examines an understudied relationship among Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, David Walker's Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, and William Apes's "An Indian's Looking-Glass for the White Man."  Scholars have recognized the influence of Walker's Appeal on Apes's "Looking-Glass"—both published as pamphlets in Boston in 1829-30 and 1833, respectively—but have left unconsidered the significant influence of Jefferson's Notes on both.  Walker based his scathing response to Jefferson in his controversial pamphlet on the eighth American edition of Notes, published in Boston in 1801.  This edition includes the so-called Logan appendix, in which Jefferson defends his inclusion of Chief Logan's well-known 1774 speech as evidence for his argument respecting Native American eloquence and, thus, intellectual capacity in Notes.  Challenged as a fraud in a series of letters penned by his political enemies and published in newspapers in the 1790s, Jefferson found himself compelled to revisit his ideas about authorship and authority that he had articulated in Query XIV as important elements in his conclusions about the intellectual capacities of whites, Native Americans, and people of African descent.  Significantly, Jefferson deploys what Meredith McGill has termed "the culture of reprinting" as an important part of his self-defense as an author, arguing that he was only one among countless reprinters of the Logan speech rather than its originator.  I argue that David Walker and William Apes perceived this tension between the different editions of Notes—specifically between the Logan appendix and Query XIV— and exploited it to challenge Jefferson's conclusions about blacks' and Indians' abilities as authors.  Understood relation to Jefferson's Notes, we better recognize the two pamphlets as powerful arguments for and material evidence of African and Native Americans' full-fledged humanity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars have passingly linked David Walker and William Apes as working in a multiracial community of Boston activists against racism and for equal rights, leaving a close, comparative examination of Walker's Appeal (1829-30) and Apes's "An Indian's Looking-Glass for the White Man" (1833) to be undertaken.  My paper examines the two pamphlets to argue that Apes is not just influenced by the confrontational rhetorical style of Walker's Appeal, but also directly borrows language from Walker's pamphlet to confront white Christian Americans—as Walker does—with their hypocrisy.  Like Walker, Apes does so by means of the pamphlet, the preferred format of radicals for unsettling the status quo.  Taking seriously Apes's metonym of the mirror—a formerly exclusive technology that, parallel with the pamphlet, had become available to the masses for both self-examination and critique—this paper illuminates how Walker implicitly and Apes explicitly seize on visual technology and print format to reflect back to white Christian Americans their principles as they actually look in practice to Native and African Americans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper considers the case of Paola Brown, a free black emigrant to Upper Canada from Pennsylvania, who published in 1851 an unacknowledged reprinting of David Walker's Appeal (Boston, 1829-30) as his own Address.  My comparison of the two pamphlets focuses on the different graphic form that the same message took, asking whether Brown's Address can be considered either plagiarism or a reprint of Walker's Appeal without reproduce the striking typography that was so integral to Walker's message.  More broadly, I reconsider Meredith McGill's claim about antebellum American literature's emergence through a "culture of reprinting" in light of the profuse reprint culture of antislavery that extended beyond national boundaries.  If texts were circulating so freely between the United States and Canada, I asks, what properly constitutes African American literature, American literature, or more broadly, American print culture?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Negotiating Sites of Memory," the presidential theme for the 2015 MLA convention together with the approval of an MLA Memory Studies forum in 2014 attest to an increasingly widespread application of the discipline of memory studies to the areas of scholarly endeavor the MLA supports, including the teaching of literature and writing. Previous MLA sessions related to teaching memory studies include "Teaching Life Writing Now" (presiding, Cassuto, 2011), and "Reading Memory: Approaches to Teaching the Memoir" (presiding, Donohue, 2015). Our panel will contribute to this growing conversation while also pushing the boundaries of memory studies pedagogy in literature courses beyond its close affiliation with memoir and literary criticism to attend to the cultural processes by which memories are shared. In the past several decades "cultural memory" has developed as a term to describe the ways societies remember their past using a variety of media (Astrid Erll and Ann Rigney). In this context, virtually any object of literary and cultural studies is a work of remembering, even as it at once evokes and takes root in readers' and viewers own memories, a process that takes place on the collective as well as personal level. Together our papers demonstrate that by bringing the interdisciplinary tools of memory studies into the classroom, we are able to create an "official" disciplinarily structured space for exploring the contents and operations of memory both in an object of study and at the interface of object and viewer/readers, thus opening an awareness of memory as a life practice that is fluid, creative, and shared.</Abstract>

Delineating between the project's first and completed sections (cc. 1-38 and 53-60) and its unfinished, experimental section (cc. 39–52 and 60-72), Storey examines the need to treat the two sections of the manuscript as two editorially distinguishable units that have to be edited with different methods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Almost as soon as Americans started making daguerreotypes, they made daguerreotypes of George Washington. The fact that he was unavailable to be photographed from life, it seems, was no major obstacle. Though he died in 1799 – a full forty years before photography's invention – the nation's first president appeared nevertheless as a subject in daguerreotypes of busts, painted portraits, and prints, ironically making daguerreotypes of Washington's image some of the earliest presidential photographs. My presentation, adapted from the introduction to my NEH-funded book project, explores some of the possible reasons why.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawn from my book-in-progress, this paper thus uses Silas Marner and Very Hard Cash to urge a broader point about mid-Victorian fiction: that in its many returns to this conception of subjectivity as thoroughly interpenetrated by the problems of capital, mid-century novels express a peculiar anxiety regarding the systematic erosion, or perhaps even collapse, of the boundary that nominally divides property from subjectivity—an erosion that has its roots, as I argue elsewhere in the book, in the rise of autobiography as a commercial genre during the period 1825-1860. In the larger project, I explore the historical realities and theoretical possibilities of this pivotal moment when autobiography, alongside developments in photography, copyright law, and even census-taking and licensure, made subjectivity into "portable property" designed explicitly for the Victorian marketplace. More immediately here, I argue that Eliot's and Reade's novels interrogate certain implications of this development by revealing the extent to which, by mid-century, subjectivity had come already to be conceived as property, structured like it, interchangeable with it, and vulnerable to dangerous rules of ownership and exchange. Both novels rely upon a mode of representation that figures economic loss as both mental and sexual trauma—as a sudden annihilation of the self, in the senses of both the linguistic ability to express subjectivity and the intrinsic desire that ought to sustain it. In each case, the initial preoccupation with networks of capitalist accumulation and exchange gives way, by novel's end, to a much more alarming recognition: that the subject has already been pervaded by, and cannot do without, capitalism's textual, imaginative, and representational demands.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawn from my book in progress, this paper argues that the new demand for names constitutes and expresses an ideology that was, at mid-century, deliberately turning identity into a textual thing, a form of property pervaded by the forms of social power that capitalism was generally bringing to bear upon the Victorian subject. The book argues broadly that during the first half of the nineteenth century, the impulse to textualize the subject and so turn it into an object of exchange characterizes several early-Victorian cultural formations, chief among them the commercial rise of autobiography during 1820-1860. More to the point, and in the case of the census, the impulse to textualize and economize the subject found expression also in the wide formalization of official technologies—registries, licensing, and copyright, among others—that brought the subject into legal existence by giving it concrete form. Given the explicitly economic origins of the original Census Act in 1801, I want to focus this essay on the 1841 revision, which turned a novel mechanism for economic aggregation and classification into something much more personal, and to consider the complex implications of that revision against the nexus of subjectivity-text-commodity that characterized the emergent capitalism of the 1840s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawn from my book in progress, this paper argues for a new—or at least an alternative—history of Victorian life-writing, and for a new sense of the role the genre played in not only the literary market but also in the popular and critical consciousness. During particularly the 1850s, autobiography proliferated at an unprecedented rate and came into its own for the first time as a deliberately commercial genre. In response, Victorian reviewers wondered openly, and often angrily or anxiously, about the culturally insidious implications of this new tendency to turn private identity itself into a kind of "portable property" available for capitalist exchange. My aim, then, is to articulate a new way of thinking about the form, function, and ideological significance of Victorian autobiography as it "rose" to literary and commercial prominence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 1820 and 1860, autobiography became for the first time an explicitly commercialized genre of English prose. As it did, it provoked significant anxieties about the cultural and imaginative status of identity in a capitalist marketplace that made it into a textual object vulnerable to the dynamics of ownership and exchange. This anxiety appears most obviously in contemporary reviews, which passed from general hostility to the practice of "turning a penny" by writing autobiography to more specific complaints about the forms in which identity was obliged to appear—and the mutilations it had to undergo—to satisfy the requirements of the mid-century book market. This paper focuses particularly on the rhetoric of these reviews around 1860, at the close of Victorian autobiography's last major commercial peak, exploring the shifting nature and increasing precision of reviewers' complaints regarding the autobiographies of Mary Granville Delany, Hester Lynch Piozzi, and the Irish novelist Lady Morgan. In part, the reviews published during these years suggest that frustrations and anxieties reached their greatest intensity as autobiographical production crested during the 1850s, and they further suggest a gendered response when female identity, particularly, became a commodity in the literary market. But they also imply—in complaints about the length of such autobiographies, their factual inaccuracies, and the ways in which these problems were atonements for "Mr. Mudie's sins"—an acute sense of the extent to which autobiographies were reshaping identities, and the very idea of identity, to suit the exigencies of the Victorian literary market.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone begins as a detective story and ends—arguably, at least—as a prototypical attempt at psychoanalysis, with Ezra Jennings piecing together Dr. Candy's unconscious utterances and coaxing Franklin Blake into equally unconscious repetitions to discover the mystery of the missing Indian. More mysterious even than the disappearance of the stone, however, is the alchemy by which Collins converts the story of a missing object into the story of a missing subjectivity, as if neither The Moonstone's readers nor its internal logic can quite recognize the difference between the two. Taken from Chapter 5 of my book-in-progress, Life upon the Exchange, this paper argues that Collins's novel offers a crucial vision of subjectivity as it was remade during the middle of the nineteenth century, when the rise of autobiography as a deliberately commercial genre coincided with the advent of several other technologies—copyright law, the census, the photograph—for taking subjectivity, giving it a textual (and therefore material) form, and thus transforming it into a commodity thoroughly vulnerable to the dynamics of economic exchange. In its polyvocal first-person form, in Jennings's interventions, in the involutions of its plot, and in the drama of a fabulous diamond that threatens to lose its talismanic "identity" if it is sent off to be cut into several perfect—and, economically speaking, more valuable—stones, Collins's novel deals in many of the tropes for representing commoditized identity that I examine in Life upon the Exchange.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk explores the complex, winding, and fascinating trajectory of revitalization and (re)valorization of the Ikíitu language (a.k.a. Iquito; Zaparoan; ~15 elderly speakers) within the Ikíitu heritage community, as seen from my perspective as a participant in the ongoing Iquito Language Documentation Project (ILDP). Initiated in 2001, and designed with a core revitalization component, the ILDP provides a useful temporal frame within which to examine key changes and developments in the community-internal status of the Ikíitu language, anchored to a broader context of historical, social, economic, and political facts and factors. In this talk, I will discuss how various attitudes toward the language, both positive and negative, have been expressed in the Ikíitu community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu, Loreto, Peru, over the years, not only through overt discourse — ranging from informal conversation to reported speech to political rhetoric — but also more subtly through community members' and leaders' actions and inactions; and I will describe how these attitudes are fundamentally implicated in shaping the future of the language.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, I argue that dependent clauses in Eskaleut languages (Unangam Tunuu or Aleut, Yupik languages, Sirenikski, and Inuit) are more innovative morphologically than are independent clauses.  (The Eskaleut moods have been studied and reconstructed by numerous scholars (Hammerich 1936, Bergsland 1964, 1989, Fortescue 1984, 1995, 1998, and Vakhtin 1979, 1986); but they have not been explicitly studied from the perspective of this paper.) Dependency in Eskaleut clauses is indicated in part by verbal mood and person inflection.  The term ‘mood' covers several functions, including speech act, relative time in clause combination, and various types of dependence (embedded clauses, appositional clauses, etc.).  Eskaleut moods are typically divided as in the following table (parentheses and italics are explained below): IndependentDependent IndicativeConsequential (Interrogative)Conditional (Imperative/Optative)Conjunctive (Participial)…Language particular moods Moods frequently have multiple functions:  the conjunctive and participial moods, for example, often function independently, although structurally, they may be dependent.  Dependence is more clearly indicated by the person inflection that follows the mood.  Thus, person inflection in independent moods is morphologically similar to absolutive and relative possessed nominal inflection.  Dependent moods are characterized by subject inflection related to relative possessed nominal inflection; the differentiation of 3rd and 3rd coreferential persons; and unique object morphemes not otherwise found in the inflectional system. Some moods (indicated by parentheses in the table) have mixed person inflection, e.g. 1st and 2nd persons have independent inflection and 3rd person has dependent inflection.  Different languages do not show the same mixed inflections. A comparison of moods across the language family suggests that the original moods must have included the indicative, the conjunctive, the consequential, an</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Language contact is pervasive in the history of all Eskaleut languages of the Pacific Rim, and the languages show contact effect regardless of typological similarity or degree of relatedness.  Moreover, the degree of contact has allowed for the borrowing of features that are generally thought of as relatively impervious to borrowing, including verb inflection (cf. the pervasive Russian inflections in the well-known mixed language, Copper Island Aleut).  One aspect of Eskaleut morphosyntax that has generated a great deal of interest is the parallelism between possessive inflection on nouns and person inflection on verbs, and attempts to reconstruct the systems include Hammerich 1936, Bergsland 1951, 1964, 1989, Vakhtin 1979, 1986, Fortescue 1984, 1995, 1998, etc.  Most of these studies, despite acknowledging language contact, explain the modern reflexes of verbal person inflection in the respective languages via the traditional comparative method.  The many irregularities require much speculation, however, and the motivations for the proposed developments are not always evident.  For example, there are two variants of 2sgO verbal inflection, -t?n and -k?n, presumed to have come from an originally independent pronominal stem *t?k?-.  1sgS/2sgO forms almost universally involve the variant -k?n, while almost all others use -t?n.  Why this should be so is still unclear.  Many aspects of Eskaleut inflection remain obscure, despite the excellent studies listed above.  In this paper, I revisit the verbal inflection of the Eskaleut language Sirenikski, examining its systems of nominal and verbal person inflections within the context of the verbal mood system.  Sirenikski has been in close contact with Central Siberian Yupik (CSY) (as well as with non-Eskaleut Chukchi), and contact effects have been well described, including effects on its phonology, prosodic system, lexicon, and to a lesser extent on its derivational morphology.  Much less work has been devoted to teasing ou</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Language contact is pervasive in the history of all of the Eskaleut languages of the North Pacific Rim, and the languages Language contact is pervasive in the history of all of the Eskaleut languages of the North Pacific Rim, and the languages show contact effects regardless of typological similarity or degree of relatedness.  Thus, phonological, morphological, and syntactic features indicative of long-term contact are shared between different branches of the family (Inuit and Yupik, Sirenikski and Yupik), as well as between languages so distantly related that they are typologically different in important ways (Unangam Tunuu, aka Aleut, and Yupik, specifically Alutiiq).  Several languages also had extended contacts with other language families (Sirenikski and Siberian Yupik languages with Chukchi; Alaskan Yupik languages and Unanam Tunuu with Athabaskan languages). More important factors influencing feature sharing appear to be the degree and length of contact between languages.  Evidence of contact is both direct and indirect, and both recent and of more ancient date.  Nevertheless, relatedness has tended to mask contact effects, and they are frequently only recoverable if the evidence is direct or if there is support from other sources. Contact effects have a direct impact on our interpretations of the age of the language family, and the study thereof is crucial to understanding the tangled relationships between the individual languages.  In this presentation, I expound upon these points and I argue that a) the languages have a very long history of intermingling, making the genetic family tree model inaccurate, and b) that a cross-disciplinary approach, involving linguistics, archaeology, genetics, and the paleoenvironment, is necessary to adequately reconstruct traces of prehistoric contact.</Abstract>

Focusing on languages of the Amazon basin, and particularly those of the Naduhup language family, I present evidence for rates and pathways of grammaticalization that appear cross-linguistically unusual or extreme – relating to the rapid generation of new grammatical forms, lack of stability in inflectional and derivational morphology, evidence of ‘debonding' processes, synchronically flexible behavior of functional elements as more morphological or more syntactic, and relative promiscuity of grammatical elements' association with different word classes. Many of these phenomena can be linked to areally relevant structural characteristics, particularly the prevalence of verb serialization and noun incorporation, and an emphasis on nominalization as a subordination strategy. Many can also be shown to be grounded in locally salient sociolinguistic practices, most notably relating to zones of intensive, stable multilingualism, in which language contact has had a heavy hand in shaping rates and processes of change.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The degree to which languages may retain components of a typological profile over time has significant implications for our understanding of deep-time family relationships and of the dynamics of language contact and change (cf. Nichols 1992, Dunn et al. 2005, Donohue et al. 2011, Dunn et al. 2011). Indeed, some language families have developed extensive internal typological diversity, even where their lexicons retain a clear signal of genealogical relationship. While language contact is often an obvious driver, internal processes of change are also crucially involved, such that new categories and structures emerge through processes of reanalysis and grammaticalization (e.g. Heine &amp;amp; Kuteva 2005). Yet we still have much to understand regarding the mechanisms of these processes of change, especially where such restructuring affects many different components of the grammar. A key question in such cases is the following: to what extent are wide-ranging structural changes an assortment of relatively independent developments, versus an interconnected set within which specific catalysts may be identified? We consider these questions through the lens of Nadëb, a member of the small Naduhup language family of the northwest Amazon (Epps &amp;amp; Bolaños 2017), drawing on our collaborative fieldwork with community members (initiated 2018) and on prior work by Weir (principally a 1984 MA thesis). Nadëb is the most structurally divergent member of the Naduhup family, with a number of features that stand out not only in contrast to its three sister-languages, but also as typologically noteworthy in their own right. In fact, however, as we explore here, the diachronic emergence of several of these features can be understood as closely interconnected – and apparently predicated primarily on the development of prefixes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From a typological perspective, one of Nadëb's most striking structural features is its preference for OAV constituent order, which is cross-linguistically very rare (see Weir 1984, 1986; Dryer 2013). As contact with Portuguese increases, one might anticipate pressure for Nadëb's secondary order – AVO – to become more prominent, particularly in material like the New Testament that has been translated directly from Portuguese. Here we consider this question through the lens of a discussion that took place in a community linguistics workshop during our fieldwork in 2019. When the topic of constituent order came up, community members launched into a heated debate: some observed that the OAV order was frequent in the speech of elders and was thus the "only and right" order, while others spoke out in favor of AVO because "the New Testament [in its Nadëb translation] speaks like this". Still others voiced acceptance for both patterns. This discussion among Nadëb community members highlights how speakers may experience language endangerment and change: While a full break in transmission or the loss of particular genres may be especially salient, speakers may also be aware of structural change, and of its connections to shifting domains of experience and to different views of authority as instantiated by elders, the state, or the church. Ultimately, these perceptions on the part of speakers are relevant in directing choices about what and how to document and revitalize in work with endangered languages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Unlike its sister languages, Nadëb (Naduhup family) displays ergative-absolutive alignment, and Martins &amp;amp; Martins (1999:263) even assess it as "one of the most ergative languages of Amazonia". However, new data from recent fieldwork suggest that ergativity is less pervasive in Nadëb than has been previously implied, and that neutral, nominative-accusative, and even tripartite alignment are also attested. Here, we assess Nadëb alignment across morphology and syntax, as attested in pronominal prefixing on verbs, constituent order and deletion patterns, and other phenomena. Diachronically, we argue that a number of these patterns are probably innovative, motivated by contact with neighboring Arawakan languages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, newspaper readers in Bogotá, Colombia, were bombarded with alarming information. The Colombian press published articles speculating whether Colombia would be affected if the Cubans decided to target the Panama Canal, maps of possible nuclear fallout zones, and instructions about how to build a shelter and survive an atomic war. A headline in the newspaper El Espectador predicted that "A Bomb in Panama Would Bring Us a Slow Death." Another article warned readers that in the case of nuclear war, "You have to think only of yourself. You cannot wait for friends… Any delay can be fatal." An editorial in another newspaper, La República, reminded readers that "It is possible that while you are reading these lines someone will have determined the extinction of all human life on Earth." The coverage in the Colombian press reached such hysterical proportions that the newspapers started accusing each other of "atomic terrorism." This presentation, part of a larger project on the impact of the Cuban Missile Crisis across Latin America, explores why the Colombian coverage of the crisis was particularly alarmist. It compares it to coverage in other parts of Latin America, asking: what does this tell us about Colombian society and politics in 1962? What does it reveal about the Colombian press, and its treatment of science and technology? What impact did this press coverage have on public responses to the Cuban Missile Crisis in Colombia?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Klezmer Archive Project — Documenting Culture Bearers and Human Networks in Traditional Music Communities   Klezmer, the instrumental music of Ashkenazic Jews of Eastern Europe, was and continues to be a transnational music based in oral tradition. For decades members of the klezmer community have dreamt of a centralized repository for klezmer tunes and their historical/ethnographic context, but creating such a resource within current archival structures leaves out a critical source of knowledge—klezmer culture bearers. These individuals have a deep understanding of repertoire, history, and folklore that is highly valued within the international klezmer community, but it is only available to the whole community when it is collected and organized. With this in mind, the Klezmer Archive project (KA) aims to create a universally accessible, useful resource for interaction, discovery, and research on available information about klezmer music. Like many folk/ethnic music communities, the international network of klezmer specialists includes musicians with a range of expertise but centers around  culture-bearers who collect and share information through performance, teaching, documentation/field work, recordings, and publishing. One of the core goals of the KA project is documenting the networks of human contact through which cultural (musical) information is exchanged in ways that are not reflected by traditional metrics, such as quantity/location of performances, books published, or recording catalog (all of which have many well-worn paths for documentation).  The Klezmer Archive project is adapting and extending the DoReMus ontology (itself a harmonization of CIDOC CRM and FRBRoo, extending classes and properties specific to musical data, and a set of shared multilingual vocabularies) to document human relationships. The "human relationship" concept allows people to be connected in the data in a way that more accurately reflects how cultural knowledge is exc</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Globally, "men's rights" movements (MRMs) span pro-feminist men's groups addressing harms of sex roles, a variety of alt-right type men's organizations, alongside charitable and human-rights and environmental associations. Crucially, many of them, across the political spectrum, represent masculinity through an affective politics of abjection. The Indian MRM (like the global International Men's Day association) leans into ideas of vulnerability, loneliness and exclusion in an assertive, aggressive mode that takes simultaneous aim at feminists (especially governance linked to feminist ideas) and women (synecdochally standing in for wives) as being at the root of their plight. It locates itself within the language of human rights and gender equity, identified as the dominant discourse of inclusion (and hence of resources) in our times. This paper demonstrates the ways that the Indian MRM inscribes vulnerability and abjection onto itself. It locates the MRM within prevailing global men's rights discourses of health and harm, and follows the ways they highlight masculinity as debility, and men's health as the prime crisis, providing evidence for men's economic and social abandonment through the bodies of poor men or suicide. Drawing on such woundedness, MRAs (men's rights activists) can deflect or justify accusations of violence, and critique law and punishment. Through close readings of an exhibition sponsored by the central MRM organization, performative public actions, and the circulation of narratives about death, the paper shows the affective momentum the movement seeks to accumulate, and the forms of resistance it champions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will share insights gained from building a toolkit that uses text encoding to improve corpus creation for text analysis, with a web interface that is designed for theoretically-grounded experimentation in algorithmic text analysis. The Women Writers Project is currently developing the Women Writers Vector Toolkit (beta link at https://wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/lab/wwvt/, final version to be published in December 2018), an interface that will allow users to explore several different word embedding models trained on texts from Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) corpora that include Women Writers Online, the Victorian Women Writers Project, and Early English Books Online. Word embedding models are a powerful method for studying relationships between words in large corpora, but training and querying them requires knowledge of a computer programming language, such as Python or R.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the photograph, Sam Hinton—oceanographer, illustrator, songwriter, folk singer, folk thinker—speaks of folk music tradition in the futuristic Pauley Ballroom at the University of California, Berkeley. Hinton is likely introducing Bessie Jones and the Georgia Sea Island Singers, the Greenbriar Boys, Jean Ritchie, and other featured performers at the December 1962 Winter Berkeley Folk Music Festival. Sitting upright and attentive, front row center, is a familiar-looking beatnik. He listens intently to Hinton, who is perhaps drawing on ideas from the previous day's workshop "Learning to Sing Folk Songs—Tradition and Imitation," held with esteemed folklorists Ralph Rinzler and Charles Seeger, and also building on his 1955 Western Folklore essay "The Singer of Folk Songs and His Conscience." The young man is none other than aspiring folk/bluegrass musician Jerry Garcia. This and other newly discovered photographs of Garcia at the 1962 Winter Berkeley Folk Music Festival ask us to revisit how the young musician absorbed ideas from the folk music revival, particularly what an "imitator" could do with traditions not his own. These ideas would stay with Garcia for the rest of his life and career. Taking in Hinton's words, singing along with the Georgia Sea Island Singers at a "Fireside Sing," hanging out with Rinzler, Ritchie, and other performers and attendees, Garcia encountered debates about what it meant to try to incorporate folk music styles into one's very being rather than merely present them as antiquated museum specimens. Garcia's Zelig-like presence at the 1962 Berkeley Folk Music Festival raises important questions about race, class, region, and authenticity as they moved through vernacular musical expression in the early 1960s, particularly in Atomic Age California; this helps us reconsider what a transmitter of tradition could be within the disorienting context of postwar America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The understudied Berkeley Folk Music Festival offers a new origin point for the late 1960s Bay Area counterculture. At it, participants joined together in a more egalitarian approach to having "serious fun" through temporary festive community in the face of looming death and destruction, from social ills and injustices at home to the Vietnam War across the Pacific (in fact San Francisco was a key way station to the war zone) to nuclear apocalypse (just above the Greek Amphitheater in the Berkeley Hills, after all, was Livermore Labs, from which the nation's nuclear research program was directed) to environmental woes to other problems. How might diverse participants come together in appreciation of cultural heritage and tradition as part of seeking out new ways of living, relating to each other more humanely, and offering more democratic visions of what a public university's spaces of learning and conviviality could support? At the Berkeley Folk Music Festival, we glimpse a Bay Area counterculture in formation, one whose content and form challenges cliched portrayals of the counterculture as a reckless, anarchic, Dionysian bacchanal. Instead, the counterculture appears more like the one social critic and Berkeley resident Theodore Roszak noticed in his best-selling book, The Making of a Counter Culture: an attempt to imagine alternatives to an alienating "technocratic society."</Abstract>

From Mance Lipscomb's silhouette to ethnomusicologist Charles Seeger's hearing aid to Georgia Sea Island Singer Bessie Jones' silver brocade to Sam Hinton's nose flutes to Jesse Fuller's fodella to Jerry Garcia's gaze, we shall consider some ways we might grapple digitally with musical festivity way out West at the Berkeley Folk Music Festival.</Abstract>

Where do the two approaches meet, if they meet at all?

		<Abstract>Humbead's Revised Map of the World reimagines the globe from the perspective of the West Coast folk scene and emerging hippie counterculture. First printed in 1968, with subsequent iterations produced in 1969 and 1970, it was created by Rick Shubb and Earl Crabb, two Bay Area folk music aficionados. In this demonstration at the 6th Annual RIT Frameless Labs XR Symposium on Friday, November 19th, participants can explore the map in Google Tilt Brush. Exploration and potential collaboration by technologists and anyone interested in the project is heartily welcome. Overall, through interdisciplinary interaction and development, the goal of the project is to enter into the map as it gets revised yet again into a virtual reality object through which—and in which—we might better perceive, investigate, and explore the contents and meanings of Humbead's Revised Map of the World, the 1960s folk music revival, and post-World War II American cultural history as a whole.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Alderman recently co-directed a National Endowment for Humanities summer institute hosted by the University of Tennessee and the Tennessee Geographic Alliance. In July of this year, eighteen K-12 educators from across the country came to Knoxville to examine the central role of migration, transportation, travel and tourism in structural racism and the historical and contemporary fight for African American freedom and self-determination. The workshop featured guest lectures and hands-on lessons from experts on geographic mobility, race and racism, Black geographies, oral history, digital mapping, and educators participated in local and state-wide field trips. Dr. Alderman highlights the institute's foundational ideas and innovations, the value of creating spaces of dialogue and care for teachers during these tough times, and the need to create greater synergies between teaching history, geography, and civil rights.</Abstract>

Neumann's monograph, Antioch in Syria: A History from Coins (300 BCE-450 CE) (Cambridge University Press, 2021), critically reassesses the capital city by applying the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis and digital mapping to a database of 300,000 coin finds. Although Antioch's prominence is famous, a quantitative analysis of coins minted in the city and excavated throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East exposes the gradations of imperial power and local agency mediated within its walls. As imperial governments capitalized upon Antioch's location and amenities, the citizens developed in their own distinct identities and agency – both financial and political. This research serves as the foundation for the collaborative online exhibit, SYRIOS: Studying Urban Relationships and Identity over Ancient Syria (https://syrios.uh.edu), which teaches public audiences about how digital humanities methodologies enhance the value of coins as historical evidence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Finding a way to sustain art collections and create new spaces for visitor engagement is a challenge for most institutions, especially academic museums and galleries in the wake of the pandemic. This session is a detailed dive into the strategies and outcomes of a project supported by the NEH Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections Grant. In 2020 Gettysburg College received funding to assess the feasibility of a historic house for art storage, exhibitions, and teaching. The goal of this project is to foster collaboration among diverse constituencies, strategically consider opportunities and challenges posed by the property, envision a new academic art museum, and provide a cultural hub for the community. The grant afforded an external team of experts to consider the intersections of architecture, collections conservation, and environmental management with the requirements for historic preservation, collection storage planning, sustainability, and interdisciplinary pedagogy at the College. Members of the project team discuss their approach to creating a shared vision among stakeholders; the defining and articulation of plans with actions toward a larger goal; and how they cultivate resilience in long-term project planning. From this discussion with professionals who have worked closely as a collaborative team with museums both large and small, attendees will learn how communication and collaboration with key stakeholders at the early stages of a project can lead to practical support and exciting results.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jarawan languages figure prominently into longstanding debates among Africanists concerning their classification relative to non-Bantu Bantoid vs. Narrow Bantu languages. Recent scholarship on the matter – namely Blench 2006, Grollemund 2012, and Grollemund et al. 2018 – contends, based primarily on what is known of their lexicon, that Jarawan belongs within Bantu Group A (specifically alongside Mbam-Bubi languages, A31-40-60), though perspectives on their precise place within the group differ between scholars. This paper, based on data collected over the last three years on Mbat [iso:bau] and more recently on Duguri [iso:dbm], calls into question such a determination, illustrating that although ~20% of the Jarawan lexicon is indeed cognate with Bantu, these same items are also cognate with Bantoid. This suggests, therefore, that these vocabulary items entered the lexicon via some pre-Bantoid proto language. We illustrate that there are indeed no clear lexical innovations linking Jarawan to Bantu, including to any A40 or A60 languages. Any evidence presumed in favor of their inclusion in Bantu by vestigial nasal prefixes observed on some nouns can also be set aside, as these too are found in Eastern Grassfields languages (Hyman 1980, 2018). In further support of our determination that Jarawan languages are properly classified among other non-Bantu Bantoid languages, we present data on the Jarawan verbal system showing that the languages exhibit all and only those six verbal extensions that Hyman (2018) reconstructs for Proto-Grassfields. Furthermore, we show that these extensions are fully aspectual in the synchronic grammar of these languages, which in turn places Jarawan within "Stage 3" of Hyman's trajectory concerning the development of aspectual function from extensions earlier involved in valency changing operations. As such, Jarawan is perhaps a step beyond even some other Bantoid languages in this regard, as Hyman proposes that Bantoid languages, as a group,</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jarawan languages have long fascinated Africanists, and particularly historical linguists and linguistic typologists. They stand near the cusp of the Bantoid-Narrow Bantu divide, with descriptions and classifications dating back to the early 20th century making claims that they belong in one group vs. the other. Until recently, however, remarkably little is known about them beyond wordlists, some of which contain only a few dozen words, and a single short descriptive paper. The most recent classifications based on extensive comparison and advances in lexicostatistic modeling claim that they belong among the Group A Narrow Bantu, though details differ from scholar to scholar. In this paper, it is illustrated that data collected over the last three years on three Jarawan languages, and subsequent reanalysis of existing wordlists and the sound changes observed therein, do not support the same conclusion. From a lexical standpoint, it is shown that while Jarawan languages indeed share approximately 20 percent of their cognates with Proto Bantu, these same cognates are also shared with Proto Grassfields, and often with Proto Benue-Congo; they cannot be shared Bantu innovations. From a morphological standpoint, it will be shown that Jarawan languages appear more akin to certain Grassfields languages. Lastly, in terms of diachronic sound changes, whereas North-Western Bantu languages display two significant phonological innovations, these innovations are not observed in Jarawan languages. Thus, based on lexical cognates, sound changes, and morphology, this paper revisits and bolsters arguments in favor of a re-classification of Jarawan languages among other Bantoid</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The itineraries of almost 200 people of color who sought passports to leave Bordeaux, France between the 1790s and 1850s run counter to most histories of the Atlantic Slave Trade and Black migration. Most of them were free and traveling on their own account. Some had been born on the African continent, but many planned to return to where they had been born enslaved or freed in the Caribbean or to another destination in the archipelago. This small wave of migration differed from the thousands of Africans and their descendants who had often arrived enslaved in Bordeaux earlier in the eighteenth century often to return to bondage in the Caribbean.  By contrast, the group of people of color featured in this article were practicing their freedom when they prepared to set sail even as they moved closer to the beating heart of slavery when they traveled west. At the same time, the records they left in the archive provide clues about prevailing racial ideologies in France and shine a light on community formation and affective ties among people of color who otherwise have been rendered invisible. Using an otherwise cold, bureaucratic questionnaire as a point of departure, this article excavates and theorizes Black space-making and Black life in the aftermath of Atlantic Revolutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Black Bordeaux originated in the waterways and terrains of West Africa, West Central Africa, and the Caribbean as much as it did in the streets of Bordeaux. On one hand, the changing dynamics of the transatlantic slave trade with West and West Central Africa shaped the enslaved labor brought to Bordeaux during the eighteenth century. How is it possible to account for the elusive memories and ideas of the enslaved, particularly those born in West and West Central Africa, who arrived on the shores of the Garonne River, on the other? Different overlapping groups of people who contributed to the creation of this nascent Black community were shaped, if not, weighed down, by their experiences, especially the horrific ordeal of their enslavement. Notable numbers of West African children arrived in the first decades of the eighteenth century as the sociopolitical landscape of what is now Benin and underwent significant change. By the middle of the century, as French traders shifted their attention further south, a larger number of enslaved West Central Africans – caught up in a different set of circumstances – began to pour in from the area north of the Congo River from a region that includes the Congo Republic (Brazzaville) and an enclave of Angola. In fact, by the middle of the century forward, many people of color who arrived – some of them freed – had only known life in the entrenched plantation societies of the Caribbean. This chapter explores the methodological limits available to analyze how African-born enslaved and freed people engaged in space-making outside of the African continent and the physical site of the Caribbean plantation complex. The use of linguistics, archaeology, and oral narratives – used by scholars of Africa and/or the Caribbean are ever more elusive in this context as the stories of the enslaved who came before Black Bordeaux are at the interstices of the written and unwritten.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between the 1790s and 1816, over 100 people of color sought passports to leave Bordeaux, France challenging the trajectories of slave trade and migration histories and raising questions about the potential meanings of the passport for people of color in the aftermath of the French and Haitian Revolutions. I explore three themes that intersect with the larger conference project on policing and technologies of control. First, I examine how the language of passport was in dialogue with that of the Code Noir. Second, I then suggest how the passport application process could have had different implications for people of color given, for example, the physical descriptions that formed part of the procedure. Finally, although passports sought to define and track people, the same documents also revealed black social networks and geographies of freedom. How might the history of policing in France reveal Black social life rather than only chronicle Black social death?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Textual History of the Ethiopic Old Testament (THEOT) project has employed manual and computer processes to compare and analyze Ethiopic texts. The team received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 2020 to refine these processes, to publish our findings, and to offer a website for the use of other scholars. Two teams collaborate for this work, the Philology Team (Curt Niccum, Steve Delamarter, Ralph Lee, Daniel Assefa, and Garry Jost), and the Data Team (Brent Reeves, James Prather, Steve Delamarter, and Garry Jost). Our work focuses on supporting the needs/requirements of scholars to help answer their questions about the Ethiopic texts and the textual history of those texts. We are developing a website to offer two capabilities: 1. Scholars can review/check our work by examining the various artifacts, generated by hand or machine. 2. If the scholars determine that our processes may be useful for their work, they can use the processes of the website to analyze their own texts, which are not limited to texts in the Ge`ez language. The presentation will include a demonstration of our website, in the current state of development at the time of the SBL presentation</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Aniita asáana (The glutton) is, in many ways, one of the most prototypically ‘Ikíitu' narratives in the extensive text corpus of the Iquito Language Documentation Project. When narrated by Hermenegildo (Hermico) Díaz Cuyasa and audio-recorded on July 4, 2002, the content is at once mundane, morally-charged, and outlandish; and his telling of the tale is both unapologetic and funny, both deadpan and slapstick. Three fundamental themes of this narrative -- social isolation, theft, and gluttony -- are typically of great local social consequence, and not inherently humorous at all by Ikíitu norms. What, then, are the structures and structuring devices, revealed through an ethnopoetic analysis of this telling of this narrative, that distinguish a humorous telling from a humorous tale?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper describes the expression of number in Iquito [iqu], (Zaparoan; Peruvian Amazonia) focusing on the morphological exponence of Iquito's general number system within noun/determiner phases (Nps/DPs), and on the principles that permit facultative concord between NPs/DPs and their real-world referents. The Iquito number system demonstrates a contrast between plural and general (non-number), and while number morphology is obligatory in many environments, concord is not strict in the context of connected discourse in parsed texts. I argue that in Iquito, reference to number is governed by pragmatic principles of relevance and sufficiency, not by grammatical principles of exhaustive concord.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The authors of this paper are working on the first critical edition and English translation of Boccaccio's De montibus thanks to a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for scholarly editions and translations. Transmitted in 76 witnesses, including manuscripts and early editions, Boccaccio's geographical dictionary was the only one of his works that did not enjoy a critical edition. In this paper we introduce the challenges of editing this work in the absence of an authorial manuscript, as well as the methodological and technical solutions we have devised to that end. On the basis of an advanced collation of the witnesses, we will appraise the value of both the manuscript and printed tradition, that of the text offered in its currently most authoritative edition, and of recent approaches to De montibus from the point of view of the storia della tradizione.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Letters from the Dakota, 1838-1878" describes the English translation of first-person narratives of those Dakota people writing in their own language during the mid-nineteenth century. The time period selected for this project encompasses the years of most drastic change for Dakota people--treaty negotiations, land loss, war, imprisonment, exile, and the beginnings of recovery. These letters provide insights into the daily lives of prominent and ordinary Dakota people, their relationships with the federal government, and their attempts to negotiate rapid changes brought on by farming, Christianity, and settlers who overran their lands. This presentation begins with a short general introduction that provides historical and interpretive information including explanations of events and historical figures relevant to an understanding of the importance of the letters and how they came to be written. The process of translating these letters and researching the historical context is described to demonstrate their significance in preserving the Dakota language, both historically and in the present day, as well as highlighting the cultural practices surrounding the translations and translators over time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"From Gallows to Prison: Letters from the Dakota, 1862-1865" describes the English translation of first-person narratives of those Dakota people writing in their own language during the mid-nineteenth century. The time period selected for this presentation encompasses the years of most drastic change for Dakota people—treaty negotiations, land loss, war, imprisonment, and exile. As such, the voices represented in these letters have been silent for 130 to 175 years. These letters provide insights into the lives of prominent and ordinary Dakota people held in prison in Minnesota and Iowa after the war with the United States in 1862, their opinions about their relationships with the federal government, and their attempts to negotiate the rapid changes brought on by war, imprisonment, and exile. A Dakota perspective—observations of the world written in their own words in their own language—will challenge accepted representations of their issues and concerns as written by missionaries and historians. This presentation begins with a short general introduction that provides historical and interpretive information including explanations of events and historical figures relevant to an understanding of the importance of the letters and how they came to be written. The process of translating these letters and researching the historical context will be described in order to demonstrate their importance in preserving the Dakota language, both historically and in the present day, as well as highlighting the impact of prison conditions on the context of their letters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The May 1982 AAAS magazine Science boasted Joseph Menosky's cover story "Capturing the Evanescent Art: Choreography by Computer" highlighting efforts of computer scientists, dance researchers, and notators who developed programs to digitally record movement. The 1980s then saw the advent of LabanWriter, Labanotation-writing desktop software that streamlined the process of producing and reproducing Labanotation scores and replaced hand-written notation calligraphies. These developments in computer technology opened possibilities for how Labanotation and motion capture systems could potentially generate movement documents. This paper poses questions about what digital technology and Labanotation continue to do for each other as documentary record and generative function by thinking through the implications of KineScribe, a Labanotation iPad app (2013) that expands the usability of digitized Labanotation scores at the point of a touchscreen interface: literally, at the tip of a finger. As we think broadly about inscribing in an age of ephemeral documentation media, the formats for which slide into obsolescence as technologies change, I suggest that we tend to this digital mode of transmission by asking the following: What does digital humanities teach us about dance notation and embodiment with digital technology as the way through which? How can this technology retain a presence of the dancing bodies that once generated the movement, to prevent their absence in the historical record? I argue that shifts in Labanotation technologies necessitate broader changes with how we enact dances of this written record, and that the plasticity of digital technology supports Labanotation's endurance in dance studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines Leslie Tillett's appropriation of modern aesthetics to tell the story of the Spanish conquest of Mexico in a monumental textile finished in 1977.  As a representation of foreign invasion, El Tapiz (copyrighted by Leslie Tillett as The Tillett Tapestry in 1978) brings to light a layered history of the violence and horror of conquest alongside cross-cultural design perspectives that the designer researched meticulously.  This paper presents new information about the tapestry that was not known previously and will be published in the digital commons proceedings of the Textile Society of America's 15th Biennial Symposium sponsored by the University of Nebraska Press.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The history of photography and the legal presentation of documentary proof enjoyed a complex relationship from the nineteenth century onwards, which was variously fuelled by pragmatism and suspicion. This workshop aims to examine the ways in which photographic technologies have contributed, both practically and symbolically, to the construction of particular legal, evidential and affective modes of vision. Criminal mugshots, passport photographs and other forms of official and domestic styles of photographing the face will be considered in their historical and geographical contexts and in relation to forms of gendered colonial and post-colonial identity. The workshop will be informal and structured around 30-minute papers, with generous time for discussion amongst the audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In an effort to increase student engagement with the humanities on campus, Hinds Community College-Utica, an HBCU in rural Mississippi, launched a new course centered around the founding of our institution. Introduction to the Humanities is a team-taught course offered by the humanities faculty where each instructor delivered a different 2-3 week unit. The students were engaged in a study of Black rural education in the context of the Jim Crow south though a careful reading of Black Man's Burden, the autobiography of our founder, William H. Holtzclaw. Funded through a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the course has allowed our small campus the opportunity to investigate Holtzclaw's life and legacy through both faculty research and students' undergraduate research projects. In this session, we will discuss lessons learned from this experience for colleges who may wish to explore institutional history with their own students. We will discuss the creation of our shared syllabus, an overview of the project, incorporating undergraduate student research projects, and engaging students in archival work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As part of a recently funded NEH grant, the humanities faculty at Hinds CC-Utica came together to teach a new course – Introduction to the Humanities – built around the unique history of our school's founder, William H. Holtzclaw. As an HBCU in rural Mississippi, our course seeks to explore the promise and challenges faced by Holtzclaw to start a "little Tuskegee" with an eye toward the implications of this legacy in an increasingly polarized world. In addition to fostering an appreciation for the humanities in American life, our goal for our students in the course is to expose them to rich opportunities for undergraduate research in the humanities (each student developed a semester-long research project in concert with a faculty mentor). Through a series of faculty development workshops and seminars, 7 Hinds faculty members worked together to create and deliver the course content. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In this session, we will discuss lessons learned from this adventure in team teaching, as well as suggestions for other community colleges who might want to adopt a similar approach. We will highlight NEH funding opportunities as well.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Encouraging attention to paratexts beyond the prefatory, William Sherman argues the "words and signs" marking a text's end "do more to make . . . a book, and announce it as such, than any other feature." How might such moments of consolidation also suggest new beginnings for reading? Examining the 1590 Faerie Queene, and its "Letter of the Authors," provides a sense of possibilities. While many, including Andrew Zurcher, have discussed the "Letter's" near-terminal placement, modes of reading facilitated by this location remain to be explored fully. Introductory in tone, yet retrospective in effect, the "Letter" provides perspective on a polyvalent narrative, underscoring, in Helen Smith and Louise Wilson's words, the paratext's ability to signal "points of entry, interpretation, and contestation," in a time when much reading was rereading. With an eye to the prevalence of this placement, I will explore ways such a concluding gesture need not signal closure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How might editors annotate what they cannot identify? Under such circumstances, might a TEI archive's own markup lead the way to new discoveries? Within Digital Mitford: The Mary Russell Mitford Archive, the challenge of locating the mysterious "Miss James" proves emblematic. Referenced solely by patronym, "Miss James" became a topic of conjecture when multiple editors shared questions about the same elusive figure. In letters penned by Mitford in 1819 and after, "Miss James" emerged as Mary Mitford's trusted friend and advisor. She was also an opinionated humorist, offering assessments of everything from mutual acquaintances to literary works. Yet while her Christian name and profession were later discovered by project editors, her history remains largely unearthed.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; What insights might processing Digital Mitford's own markup reveal about such a figure? Inspired by Douglas Duhaime's visualized co-citations in the EEBO-TCP corpus, we view clusters of related data as forms of annotation—ones that, rendered judiciously, aid both scholars and those newer to Mitford's oeuvre. Working with XQuery on our eXist database of project files, we first assess the prevalence of relational categories tagged by our editors, then use these counts to weight lists of high-frequency tokens in ranges indexed by a key term. Visualized, the resulting bouquets of knowledge suggest lines of inquiry—ones "locating" the unknown while enhancing perspectives the TEI archive itself may offer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>‘Epidemics, like wars, mark a generation for life'. This presentation discusses the creation of an interactive memorial that was designed to augment the viewing of the textile Quilt. I will demonstrate three digital experiences: 1) an open-source mobile web application called AIDS QUILT TOUCH; 2) a tangible tabletop interactive that enables viewers to SEARCH the database of Quilt images to find a specific image and to BROWSE the archive of Quilt panel images; and 3) a community sourcing application that engages people in analyzing and archiving information about the Quilt. This effort is framed by a transmedia book project called Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination At Work. In creating the Quilt Digital Experiences I was interested in exploring the cultural work of public interactives, to examine how they are implicated in practices of cultural reproduction — remembering, witnessing, archiving and educating.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Increasingly, being able to visualize large collections of data is absolutely vital in the domain of cultural heritage—both for scholarly work and public consumption. Recent work explores novel and engaging ways to visualize and explore cultural heritage data collections.  In this session, see demos of applications built on Microsoft PixelSense and tablets that demonstrate the advantages of pen and touch computing for enhancing the user experience of specific applications. These range from handwriting mathematics with pen or finger as input, to mathematical solvers, to using multi-touch interaction for exploring large-format artworks in their rich context of related artworks, annotations, and guided tours.  We also explore the technological and social challenges of creating interactive exhibits around the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest community-created piece of folk art in the world. These applications are a beachhead on the untouched shores of big humanities research. They are what we can actually expect today and in the near future and are also first steps toward what might define an ideal user interface.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the fall of 1869, two teams of lawyers squared off over whether the Cincinnati school board had the power to end a thirty-year tradition: Bible reading at the start of the school day. The battle became a national controversy in which the press across the country took sides. Throughout the Bible War, as it came to be called, supporters of the Bible in the schools pointed to clause in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, repeated in the Ohio Constitutions of 1802 and 1851: "Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." This powerful idea—that schools, religion, and the state rise and fall together—drew directly on the traditions of New England from where the men of the Ohio Company of Associates came. They asked the federal government to donate a section of land in each township for the support of schools and another for the support of a minister—a request that astonished and annoyed James Madison of Virginia. Yet the Ohio Company succeeded in gaining both provisions from the US Treasury. The early advocates of public schools in Ohio overwhelmingly pious Protestant and often ministers also shared in this idea. The story of the Northwest Ordinance and its legacy shows us how Americans first argued over religion's place in the Republic, how rival church-state traditions lived on in new states, and then shaped the rise of new state institutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper outlined the process of creating a scholarly edition of historical documents and highlighted several of the associated challenges related to manuscripts. An anonymous letter, signed "The Devil," led the editor of the Correspondence of James K. Polk on an investigation to learn the author's identity. The copy press, an eighteenth- and nineteenth-century precursor of the photocopier, enabled President Polk to retain copies of his outgoing letters but left his editor with often-difficult-to-decipher documents. Finally, the inside an envelope retained a faint, backwards copy of the missing letter it once had contained; digital manipulation allowed the editor to read this lost document.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This poster presented the work of the James K. Polk Project, a major undertaking in documentary editing. The project produces a selected and annotated edition of letters by and to Polk (1795–1849), who served from 1845 to 1849 as the eleventh president of the United States. The letterpress and digital volumes for the first time make important documents—many held by the Library of Congress but others scattered among numerous archives and private collections—easily accessible to scholars, students, and others interested in U.S. history. The letters cover political and diplomatic topics ranging from Andrew Jackson's war on the Bank of the United States to the Mexican-American War and from the growing debate over slavery to relations with the Kingdom of Hawaii. The letters also illuminate the culture, society, economy, and science of the first half of the nineteenth century.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The poster taught American Historical Association members about both the work of the Polk Project and the historical field of documentary editing. Images of a manuscript letter highlighted the rich primary-source material the project makes accessible. Bullet points and quotations from letters introduced some of the diverse historical topics documented by the letters. A map showed the many repositories that house Polk letters. Transcriptions and annotations showed the work process of an editor. The presenter brought copies of a published volume and the forthcoming thirteenth volume, as well as a laptop to demonstrate the project's online products. In conversations with the audience, the presenter explained not only the project's work and accomplishments over the past six decades but also the ongoing work to prepare the fourteenth and final volume. The poster format thus best facilitated the presentation of a letterpress and digital project dedicated to making often-hidden nineteenth-century sources accessible and legible to a twenty-first-century audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores how digital tools, and topic modeling in particular, can help us measure and render violence against female bodies in early modern texts. Literary topic modeling projects thus far have prioritized recognizably thematic word clusters, dismissing other topic outputs as problematic. I instead demonstrate how "junk topics"—those that do not align as neatly with our standards of legibility—can be productive tools for revealing the often coded and implicit registers of violence against women in the early modern archive. Taking Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Cymbeline as my central examples, this paper will demonstrate how "junk topics" reveal literary and structural patterns that prompt new close readings of gendered violence in these plays. This paper intervenes in early modern feminist studies, while also engaging with digital text analysis practices by proposing a method of topic modeling that attends to the semantically opaque rather than the semantically evident.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Renaissance recipe books in manuscript can contain startlingly exotic ingredients. But, while crabs' eyes, snails, and mummia might catch a readers' attention, the Early Modern Recipes Online Collective's searchable transcriptions of manuscript recipe books provide surprising new views of what is typical in English domestic practice. Newly available electronic texts reveal that the most commonly named item in Renaissance recipes is water — an initially unexpected finding that asks us to look at domestic procedures with new eyes. My paper examines the particular varieties of water called for and produced by the era's recipes, as well as water's key role as a tool in domestic production methods. Examining water's largely unnoticed importance, and making explicit the labor and specialized knowledge associated with it in recipe books, my presentation will show how experimenting with new searchable manuscript texts can change our view of domestic practice and women's work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Wellcome Library manuscript MS 7113 epitomizes the promise of working with recipe books to reconstruct early modern social networks. Owned by Lady Anne Fanshawe and later inherited by her daughter, MS 7113 shows the effects of marriages, politics, and social upheavals on early modern domestic life, and its yet-unstudied marginal notations and recipes written in English and Spanish bear the influence of Lady Anne's travels to France, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. As these notations often indicate who donated recipes to the household and as particular dishes such as "seviche" and "Spanish Bacon" specify recipe and ingredient location, MS 7113 hints at both the social networks within which the Fanshawes operated as well as the way English households engaged with foreign cookery and medicine.  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This presentation will trace intersections between Lady Anne's travels and recipe collecting habits while also demonstrating how today's collaborative methods are bringing to light the networks that created early modern manuscript recipe collections. Taking MS 7113 as our model, we will also show how collaborations like The Early Modern Recipes Online Collective and the Herbal History Research Network allow scholars from disparate campuses to map similarly long-distance relationships that influence domestic practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using the textual tagging software Docuscope, this paper attempts to clarify the relationship between Renaissance drama and the polyglot language-learning dialogues of authors including John Florio, Claudius Hollyband, and William Stepney. In the past, critics often viewed these multilingual manuals as "sources" for Shakespeare and his contemporary dramatists, or more simply referred to the dialogues as "theatrical." It is my contention, however, that grouping the dialogues with the drama and subjecting both to a principal component analysis enables us to observe the precise linguistic features that have seemed so "theatrical" to critics. Indeed, this approach renders visible several overlapping characteristics of the language in comedie (particularly "city comedies") and the language in Florio, Hollyband, and Stepney's manuals. These findings, as I will show, permit us not only to question the boundaries of city comedy, but to reverse the established paradigm and consider Renaissance plays as staged dialogues for early language-learners.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation focused on works by German art historian August Schmarsow, in which physiological aesthetics came together with research in ‘primitive' art. In these writings Schmarsow intervenes in a turn-of-the-twentieth-century German-speaking discourse on the "beginnings" of art and ornament, in which an interdisciplinary group of theorists examined recently discovered ‘primitive' forms. The presentation discussed Schmarsow's work in relationship to turn-of-the-century art theory, perceptual psychology, and ethnology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation was the keynote address for the international colloquium "Artistic Exchanges as Cultural Transfers Between China and Europe in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries," held at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Lille, France. The colloquium explored Sino-European artistic interactions by looking at some of the ways European and Chinese art and culture were shaped by these artistic exchanges. It investigated the processes of adaptation, transposition, and accommodation at work in these cultural transfers that encompassed various artistic and disciplinary fields such as garden and design history, material culture, drama, cultural history, and the histories of painting and collecting.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many Ottoman intellectuals, in their conceptualization of civilization, aimed to reconcile the material achievements of European civilization with Ottoman-Islamic morality and aesthetics. Even so, historiographies in the post-Ottoman sovereign states have often equated modernization with de-Ottomanization, a notion which excludes the Ottoman period as a legitimate setting for the study of modernity. This paper explores moralizing writing and culture as a component of the trope toward modernity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Kizilbash, today referred to as Alevis, constitute the largest religious minority in modern Turkey, making up somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of the country's population, with smaller pockets of related groups in the Balkans and Iraq. The talk explores the formation and transformation of the Kizilbash/Alevi communities in the borderland territories between two imperial powers, the Ottomans and the Safavids, demonstrating the crucial role of informal networks of saintly lineages and Sufi convents in forging and sustaining their collective structures and identities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk examines the changing role of statistics in the apparatus through which objects and practices are being known and intervened upon (governed) in Turkey. It argues that statistics are a crucial piece of the assemblage of human and non-human things involved in the large-scale transformation of institutions in Turkey in line with EU norms and standards, and that this work of reforming of institutions, practices and ultimately livelihoods is often undertaken in the name of technical adjustments merely to collect better data. Hence through the study of changes in Turkey's collection and use of statistics we are in a position to examine the processes through which collectivities in Turkey are made commensurable with those in the EU. By looking at the case of agriculture and agriculture statistics I show how it is through the reform of statistics along EU standards that a lot of the ‘work' of engineering commensurability of social forms is accomplished. Finally, I suggest that what this means is that the work of reform is done through the reform of statistics at least as much as, if not more than, through more explicitly deliberative mechanisms, which points to the technopolitical nature of reform itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Reproducibility of research is an area of growing concern in computer vision. Scientific workflows provide a structured methodology for standardized replication and testing of state-of-the-art models, open publication of datasets and software together, and ease of analysis by re-using pre-existing components. In this paper, we present initial work in developing a framework that will allow reuse and extension of many computer vision methods, as well as allowing easy reproducibility of analytical results, by publishing dadasets and workflows packaged together as linked data. Our approach uses the WINGS semantic workflow system which validates semantic constraints of the computer vision algorithms, making it easy for non-experts to correctly apply state-of-the-art image processing methods to their data. We show the ease of use of semantic workflows for reproducibility in computer vision by both utilizing pre-developed workflow fragments and developing novel computer vision workflow fragments for a video activity recognition task, analysis of multimedia web content, and the analysis of artistic style in paintings using convolutional neural networks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>There has been an explosion of interest in the marriage of cognitive science and aesthetics in recent years. However, some prominent philosophers (Alva Noë, Strange Tools, Hill and Wang, 2016) and art critics (Blake Gopnik, "Aesthetic Science and Artistic Knowledge," in eds. Arthur Shimamura &amp;amp; Stephen Palmer, Aesthetic Science: Connecting Minds, Brains, and Experience, Oxford, 2013)  have questioned whether this research truly adds anything to our understanding of art. The question is whether cognitive science and aesthetics is looking for art in the right place. Can an investigation of our ordinary psychological engagement with artworks reveal what makes this category of artifacts unique and so deeply meaningful to us? Bill Seeley will discuss how recent research in visual stylometry and machine learning has been used to help answer this skeptical concern.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent interdisciplinary research in visual stylometry employs digital image analysis algorithms to study the image features and statistics that underwrite our experience and understanding of artworks. This research brings philosophers, psychologists, computer scientists, and art historians together to explore the formal image qualities that define artistic style. We introduce the field of visual stylometry, discuss it's implications for our understanding of both the nature of categories of art and the role artistic style plays in our engagement with artworks.

		<Abstract>Frege tells us that his Grundgesetze proofs are designed to show us the epistemological nature of the truths of arithmetic – that these truths are analytic.  And he tells us that in order to establish this we need gapless proofs of the basic truths of arithmetic from logical laws.  But are the basic Begriffsschrift laws – the laws from which he attempts to prove truth of arithmetic – laws of logic? Frege himself expressed doubt about Basic Law V, even in the preface to volume i of Grundgesetze.  Why, then, did Frege think it was a logical law and what did he think he needed to do to convince his readers of this?  Richard Heck thinks the answer is obvious: Frege thought that he had a semantic proof of Basic Law V and he expected this proof to convince his readers that it was a logical law.  In his recent book, Reading Frege's Grundgesetze, Heck argues for this view and attempts to explain the semantic proof. I shall argue that Heck is mistaken. Frege does not give a semantic proof of Basic Law V.  Indeed, Heck's assumption – that a semantic proof can show us that a basic law belongs to logic – is incompatible with Frege's explicit statements. Moreover, there is no mystery about why it is that Frege took Basic Law V to be a logical law.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past decade, film and media studies has seen the exciting rise of videographic criticism as an important and legitimate form of scholarship, with numerous publication and presentation venues emerging for academic video essays. While the parallels between video essays and journal articles are inexact, a videographic essay typically functions at roughly the same scope of a written article—but what would the videographic parallel be to an academic book? In this presentation, Jason Mittell explores the possibilities of a longer-format mode of videographic criticism, focusing both on potentials of the newly launched book series Videographic Books that he is editing for Lever Press, and his videographic book-in-progress, "The Chemistry of Character in BREAKING BAD."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the Chinese Communist Party's construction, during the Great Leap Famine of 1958-62, of a new vocabulary of disaster fitting for a socialist society in which famine could not exist.  Because famines played an important role in China's long history, conquering hunger became a key legitimizing principle for the Chinese Communists, who came to power in 1949 promising that "not one person would starve to death" under their rule.  Given this context, when famine conditions began to spread across China in 1959 due to policies connected to the Great Leap Forward, it became increasingly dangerous for observers on any level to admit that a major famine was in fact occurring.  Instead, jettisoning both time-honored famine relief strategies and traditional icons of starvation, the Party developed a new lexicon that sought to end the massive famine without ever acknowledging its existence. This paper explores the use of four key phrases -- "produce to provide relief for yourself" (????), "food substitutes" (???), "swelling disease" (???) and "women's illnesses" (???) -- that are ubiquitous in archival documents from the Great Leap Famine. The first two phrases, I argue, introduced new "relief" strategies that aimed to increase the amount of food available in rural China without reducing high grain quotas, while the last two demonstrate how cadres medicalized starvation to explain soaring death rates and plummeting birth rates without acknowledging famine conditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the wide array of remedies used to treat malnutrition-related gynecological ailments during the Great Leap Famine of 1958-62, as well as the important role that prominent female physicians and young female health workers played in identifying or employing such treatments.  Because both acknowledging famine conditions and reducing high grain quotas were politically dangerous during the Great Leap disaster, cadres at all levels engaged in a pronounced "medicalization of starvation."  Rising mortality rates were attributed to "fuzhongbing" (edema), and plummeting birthrates were blamed on "funübing" (women's diseases), in particular amenorrhea and uterine prolapse. Finding it politically untenable to provide relief grain, between 1959 and 1961 officials at the provincial and county levels instead sent large teams of medical personnel to rural areas to treat the starving with a combination of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and biomedicine.  This paper focuses on how the 1950s campaign to unify Chinese and Western medicines shaped the top-down and bottom-up development of an eclectic mix of treatments for amenorrhea (the cessation of menstruation in women of child-bearing age) and uterine prolapse during the famine.  I also examine how, by whom, and to what effect these therapies were used to treat famished women in severely-affected counties in Anhui and Henan.  I find that while medical interventions did little to address the root cause – starvation and overwork -- of these "women's diseases," the exhaustive search for cures provides a vivid snapshot of Mao-era medical theory, gender ideals, and state responses to public health crises.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines gendered experiences of famine and famine relief campaigns during China's Henan Famine of 1942-43.  The wartime Henan Famine, which killed between 1 and 3 million people, occurred in the context of both a severe drought in North China's strategically important Henan Province, and a brutal tri-polar struggle between the invading Japanese army, China's Nationalist government, and Chinese Communist forces.  During the famine, Nationalist government officials in unoccupied parts of Henan and its neighboring provinces, as well as their Communist rivals located in base areas behind Japanese lines, promoted gendered work relief campaigns that aimed to feed starving women by arranging for them to earn grain by spinning and weaving cloth.  Missionary relief workers and other foreigners active in wartime China launched similar endeavors.  These campaigns had patriotic, economic and social goals, including supporting China's wartime resistance by engaging famine refugees in textile production that could address serious wartime shortages, and curtailing the widespread practice of selling famished girls and women as child brides or prostitutes.  In the case of the spinning and weaving movement organized by the Communists in their Taihang Base area in 1942, women's spinning co-operatives also aimed to "liberate" women and change production relations within the family.  This paper compares and contrasts the gendered famine relief efforts conducted by the Nationalist state and its Communist rivals during the wartime Henan Famine, and evaluates the aims and impact of these campaigns.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The question of "Who owns this?" has long loomed over Porgy and Bess, the 1935 opera about a Gullah Geechee community in a Charleston tenement called Catfish Row. The representation of marginalized communities is always fraught, and this piece is especially contentious because it was created by outsiders—the Russian-Jewish brothers George and Ira Gershwin, and the White Charleston couple DuBose and Dorothy Heyward. Despite ongoing debates about the work, particularly its treatment of race, there has been troublingly little focus on the Gullah people.  My presentation also evaluates Porgy and Bess in the larger context of controversies surrounding representation, focusing particularly on the discourse among Black intellectuals around the time the opera and its source materials were written. Sterling A. Brown warned against looking down on places like Catfish Row, and noted the importance of proper framing. In 1959, James Baldwin observed that what Porgy and Bess and its audiences were missing is how the story is shaped by the realities of life in the Jim Crow south. A closer examination of the score and libretto, including several revealing lines that are either cut or sanitized in most productions, reveals that thoughtful productions could make for an effective vehicle for greater understanding. As Baldwin noted, the characters "keep reminding one, most forcefully, of a real Catfish Row."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk motivates the view that intelligent reasoning must be embodied. First it advocates for the Semantic Efficacy thesis -- the view that the contents of intelligent states and processes are causally relevant to cognition and behavior. Then it explores the implications of this thesis and motivates an anti-reductive approach to studying the foundations of intelligence. Lastly, in light of the foregoing, it discusses some recent AI systems such as GPT3 and assesses whether they shed light on the grounds of intelligence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The ubiquity of gendered, particularly feminized, AIs (Alexa, Siri) raises serious ethical concerns, alongside future policy considerations, about the role that these AI assistants may have in reinforcing sexist and dehumanizing divisions of labor, particularly as many typical tasks assigned to these assistants (scheduling, reminding, caring) are thought of as stereotypically "feminine." To date, no significant empirical interventions have been carried out on this topic. Our series of studies has begun to shed some light on this important topic by building off of related work in the domain of human-robot interaction (Kuchenbrandt et al. 2014). We hypothesized that there would be a series of at least nine interactions between AI-, participant-, and task-gender. Initial results support this complex picture. We found, for instance, that participants are more likely to assign tasks to feminized- versus masculinized-AIs (t(416) = 2.82, adjusted p &amp;amp;lt; .05), and this effect is pronounced for male-participants assigned to feminized-activities (t(415) = 2.82, adjusted p &amp;amp;lt; .05).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk aimed to refocus the discussion of weaponized robots away from their potential physical and moral capacities, embracing instead an empirically more effective and morally more accurate focus on what information humans require to make ethical decisions about them. Humans can't be required to be infallible nor have perfect information; they cannot even require the ability to abort their robots' commanded tasks throughout a mission since there are already many extant systems that don't carry such guarantees. Human capability to conform to the rules of engagement and LOAC can't be accomplished by merely restricting some specific scope of activity (e.g. machine may select but human must explicitly permit a lethal action) since technology is changing so rapidly. Interjecting human in loop does not necessarily increase control (e.g., if there are significant lags in communications). Introducing the notion of permissible uncertainty focuses on the appropriate epistemic conditions concerning what humans need to know or be able to think about. Traditional LOAC already accounts for an increased degree of abstraction up the chain of command which doesn't vitiate human responsibility and accountability. Permissible uncertainty for humans commanding lethal robot systems analogously requires knowing with adequate certainty that command will be accurately carried out. Several examples from the literature further motivate the appeal to permissible uncertainty by illuminating the futility of seeking specific restrictions or increased human control tied to specific levels of robot capability. Finally, this view clarifies what is needed from robotics as a discipline: designing systems (of design and development as well as testing and verification) for which legal guidance can be used to define permissible uncertainty.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Linguistic studies of Michif (ISO 639-3: crg), a contact language spoken by members of the Métis Nation on the northern Great Plains, have frequently observed two distinct systems of nominal classification in the language—one based on French-derived gender (masculine- feminine), and another based on Algonquian-derived animacy (animate-inanimate) (Bakker 1997; Papen 2003). More recent research in this area has noted variability in both animacy and gender assignment, both within and among present-day Michif speakers (e.g., Gillon &amp;amp; Rosen 2018, Papen 2003, Sammons 2019). While these recent studies draw valuable attention to the presence of such variability as a feature of contemporary Michif, it is not immediately clear from these synchronically oriented results to what extent variation in nominal classification should be understood as a relatively recent linguistic innovation, or if it may also be attested historically in Michif. To investigate this, this study draws upon noun classifications from a corpus of several thousand Michif language example sentences produced by first-language speakers in the context of community dictionary development during the 1970s and early 1980s (Laverdure &amp;amp; Allard 1983). As one of the few extensive collections of Michif language from this time period, this source provides apparent- time information on patterns of Michif language use among speakers born one to two generations earlier than those represented in recent studies.  This study considers the scope of variability in gender and animacy assignment attested in this earlier Michif corpus as found in both native Michif lexemes and non-nativized borrowings from English, comparing these patterns against results reported in more recent studies. While not ruling out the possibility of greater present-day variability in noun classification as one result of more recent linguistic developments in the Michif language community, this work suggests that a degree of variation in Michif nominal</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter (Chapter 1) discusses dynamic changes that took place in Japanese agriculture in the late-19th and early-20 century. When Gustaf van Liebig, German chemist and "the father" of modern agricultural science, started to voice concerns about the degradation of soil in Europe, he turned to the Tokugawa-era Japanese use of night soil as the ideal way to circulate nitrogen between agricultural production and urban consumption. Karl Marx used Liebig to come up with his (now famous) concept of the metabolic lift. Yet, Japan, which after the Meiji Restoration earnestly imported Liebig's agricultural chemistry, ironically came to have the most chemical dependent agriculture in the world by the 1930s.</Abstract>

My thesis: Christian scholars of the early Christian period in Ireland (and probably elsewhere in northern Europe) were concerned not only to baptize souls but also to sanctify the landscape and purify it of non-Christian supernatural significance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper recounts the story of one particular Black European, a French citizen of Haitian descent named Jean Laraque, who circulated across French North Africa in the first part of the 20th century. Born in Paris to an elite Haitian family, Laraque was partially raised in Tunisia, completed his military service in Algeria, and briefly worked for a bank in Rabat, Morocco. Within three years of his arrival in Morocco, however, Laraque converted to Islam, moved to the Amazighophone Sous, married a local woman, and began working as a public writer who translated the complaints of disgruntled locals into the language of power: French.  While Laraque was certainly not the only Frenchman to "go native," in this paper I argue that the stakes for him were radically different for the simple fact that he was Black. Specifically, in addition to being subject to French anti-Black racism as a Black Frenchman, I argue that Laraque's decision to live "à l'arabe" resulted in him accidentally "passing" for a Black Moroccan and thus being subject to Moroccan anti-Black racism as well.  To make this argument, I bring recent literature on race, racism, and Blackness in North Africa (Becker 2020, El Hamil 2012; Scaglioni 2020) into conversation with literature on Euro-Mediterranean mobility in Afro-Mediterranean spaces. In doing so, I hope to show that stories like that of Laraque are important not only for the sake of "representation," but also because they provide us with a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, political, and, ultimately, racial(ized) Afro-Mediterranean landscapes in which all Euro-Mediterranean subjects were circulating–including those who were "white."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In classic lexicography, dictionaries are primarily static documents printed on paper and compiled by a single researcher. Modern community-based lexicography, on the other hand, is generally team-based, cross-platform, dynamic and multimedia. Multimedia dictionaries are often developed as a component of projects on the documentation of language use within its cultural context, usually combined with judicious elicitation of missing lexical items and examples of their usage. However, to produce multimedia dictionaries, one has often needed to rely on either advanced computer programming skills or the use of a suite of software packages where it is time consuming to insert the data and difficult to get it out in a form that is usable for other aspects of research. This leads to the following question: how can we develop a workflow for community-based lexicography that can integrate materials from a variety of sources while still maintaining the integrity of the original data in way that is accessible to most linguists? In this talk, I show how to apply the data science principles of portability, transparency, modularity and version control to modern lexicography so that it can move beyond this labor-intensive or programming- intensive dichotomy. Drawing from examples from three ongoing research projects with different indigenous communities in Brazilian Amazonia—Oro Win (Chapacuran), Sakurabiat (Tupian) and Kanoˆe (isolate)— I outline a workflow based off of these principles with three main advantages: (i) it only requires basic knowledge of data science practices instead of advanced programming knowledge; (ii) it relies on free and open-source software and data standards; and, (iii) it easily fits into the context of a larger documentation project by taking advantage of other common aspect of the work, such as transcription in ELAN. I also showcase a few new tools currently being developed to further aid in this process. Integrating data science principles into workf</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The last few decades have seen an enormous increase in the amount of ethnolinguistic documentation being produced with language communities all over the globe.  Besides using this documentation for linguistic research, there is a huge opportunity to transform these new resources into products that are immediately useful and accessible to the communities themselves through local electronic publishing.   In this talk I discuss the preliminary results of two ongoing projects in Brazil to develop community-oriented language materials through incorporation of archived multimedia: a dictionary with the Oro Win (Chapacuran) and a cultural encyclopedia with the Aikanã (isolate).  Both of these projects are being prepared using Markdown, a text-based markup language that is quickly become the standard for internet publishing. This talk outlines an open-source workflow using Markdown that can immediately produce html and (non-multimedia) pdf versions of these materials and discusses the possible role of local publishing in the toolkit of documentary linguists.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>O trabalho discute o papel dos dicionários multimídia no planejamento linguístico em práticas de revitalização de línguas indígenas ameaçadas. Dentre as 150 línguas no Brasil, cerca de 40% a 50% está ameaçada e a outra parte em situação de vulnerabilidade. O planejamento linguístico inclui a avaliação e a descrição do status (situação), do corpus (material existente, documentado e descrito) e da aquisição (modo de transmissão linguística e produtos disponíveis) (cf. Amaral, 2020). Nestas etapas do planejamento, os dicionários multimídia surgem como uma ferramenta para auxiliar na revitalização de uma língua e  podem ser tanto úteis no processo de transmissão da língua quanto documental e descritivo.   O objetivo principal do trabalho é abordar a importância dos dicionários multimídia como um produto multifuncional e multiuso, e apresentar a metodologia e a tecnologia envolvidas na sua elaboração. Almeja-se ainda descrever as macro e microestruturas adotadas nessas obras, decididas conforme a necessidade dos falantes ou potenciais falantes da língua.  O uso de tecnologia como smartphones, tablets ou PCs , ainda que incipiente, é uma realidade em muitas comunidades indígenas, o que favorece a implementação de dicionários em formatos digitais, cujas entradas lexicais podem ser ilustradas com recursos multimídias (além de informações conceituais, definições, transcrição, campos semânticos, exemplos  de uso, etc.). Esses formatos digitais  apresentam vantagens em relação aos formatos impressos, como a distribuição e o fácil acesso dos apps entre aqueles usuários de smartphones ou tablets, redução de custos e flexibilidade na organização da macroestrutura.  As ferramentas computacionais utilizadas no processo de elaboração desses recursos multimídias são os softwares de transcrição e anotação linguísticas (ELAN), de gerenciamento, análise e armazenamento de dados lexicais, textuais e multimídias (FLEx), uso de scripts em Python para a extração de dados do FLEx e a automat</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As home to one of the largest digital language archives in Latin America, the Museu Goeldi has been developing an open-source workflow to produce multimedia dictionaries from the collections as community reference materials. We also have a long tradition of historical linguistics, both computational and traditional. Both of these endeavors rest crucially on the development of lexical databases. In this talk we present the current digital infrastructure we have developed and discuss issues in data handling and digital publication, concluding with a wishlist for suggestions and possible collaborations from the workshop participants.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Plimoth Patuxet Museums is known for its living history exhibits of 17th-century Patuxet and Plymouth. However, the museum also houses several archaeological collections, some of which were excavated eighty years ago. Until recently, these collections were relatively inaccessible because of how they were stored and cataloged. In 2018, the museum and the Fiske Center for Archaeological Research (UMass Boston) received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to make four collections accessible to staff, descendent communities, scholars, and the general public. The museum staff, UMass Boston graduate students, and volunteers have cataloged, documented, and rehoused the collections, and made their data available online with a new public-facing database. In this paper, we reflect on the massive effort that it took to make these collections digitally accessible, what we learned through the cataloging process, and how the data will help the museum and scholars reinterpret the archaeology of 17thcentury New England.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Laredo, 1918—at the outset, this was a typical crossing at the Texas border station. A man called Abdelnour appeared before officials at the station, representing himself as a peddler merchant doing business with Syrian textile firms in New York and Mexico City. Asked for papers, Abdelnour handed over two passports, Mexican and French. The first declared Abdelnour was known to the government in Mexico City, and that he was a non-naturalized foreign resident. The second proclaimed that as a Syrian, Abdelnour status as a "French-protected" merchant. Border officials examined the contents of Abdelnour's suitcase: personal effects, odd lengths of ribbon, and a large sum of cash, no contraband. Meanwhile, he offered them letters of introduction written by two Syrian American silk kimono manufacturers in New York City, explaining he had come to Laredo to meet kimono dealers from those firms. The inspection dragged on; getting impatient, Abdelnour dramatically offered inspectors a second French passport—this one from the French Consulate in New York City—hoping to staged himself as a "known" friend to U.S. allies. And when that did not expedite things, he pushed one more document into the their hands: an old Ottoman passport, which the American official declined. Four passports and two letters of marque: inundated in documents of  vouchsafe, the inspectors allowed Abdelnour into Laredo, where he proceeded to buy textile goods for delivery to Mexico before making his return trip the next morning. This border performance was a mundane one, repeated hundreds of times daily at crossing stations along the U.S.-Mexico border. Syrian pack peddlers couriered goods here during and after the First World War, conducting a carrying trade that represented the "final mile" of the mahjar's transatlantic textile industry. In this border spectacle, Arab merchants and U.S. officials played their roles in a game of "papers please" amid the shifting geopolitics of the First World War.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>AFI Catalog of Feature Films has commenced "Women They Talk About," a project to repurpose its uniquely comprehensive, academic data to support unprecedented empirical research about gender throughout the first century of the American film industry. Named after a 1928 feature, the initiative aims to secure women in the canon through search functionality, reporting, and data visualizations. For example, scholars can evaluate actual numbers to contextualize theories that women represented 50% of silent era writers, as well as to identify names, roles and trends yet to be discovered.   Although AFI data provides the project's foundation, its success critically depends on interconnectivity with "sister" institutions—including linked data with Columbia University's Women Film Pioneers Project, BFI, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and the Geena Davis Institute. Are the semantic implications of using a feminine word ("sister") for an inanimate object ("institutions") compelling as we shift from an individualistic, hierarchical model of information production, generated by a single source (AFI), to a collaborative system of data sharing across different platforms?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2018, the AFI Catalog of Feature Films established "Women They Talk About," a project to repurpose its uniquely comprehensive, academic data to support unprecedented empirical research about the role of gender throughout the first century of the American film industry, 1893-1993. Named after the 1928 feature film, "Women They Talk About" is specifically designed to secure early female filmmakers in the historical canon by using data as a narrative tool to engender the true story of women as forerunners in the industry.  User-generated and application-driven reports will be presented with data visualizations on the AFI Catalog homepage and at AFI.com to illustrate, and authenticate, women's contributions, as well as to position gender parity as a foundational element of cultural, economic and labor history. As AFI pursues funding to underwrite software development, AFI Catalog researchers are revisiting records for pre-1930 releases to enhance documentation and add previously uncredited names to be integrated in report outcomes. For example, scholars will be able to evaluate actual data for the first time about widely circulated but unsubstantiated theories that women represented 50% of silent era story and scenario writers. "Women They Talk About" aims to open doors beyond these immediate applications and prompt discoveries yet to be imagined; however, its success is dependent on partnerships with other institutions represented at the Film Librarian's Conference.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>News of Scarlett Johansson suing Disney over Black Widow in August 2021 shocked the film industry. As the first female-driven Avengers spin-off, the A-list actress who plays Natasha Romanoff in nine franchise installments has been integral to Disney's crown jewel, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Johansson claimed the new day-and-date strategy broke her original contractual agreement for an exclusive theatrical release and expectations of profit participation from global box office gross. Under the helm of new chairman Bob Chapek, Disney responded by dismissing the lawsuit as a "callous disregard" for the global pandemic in what feminist advocate groups criticized as a "gendered character attack." In rushing to restructure traditional distribution windows amidst the struggling pandemic theatrical business and to prop up the Disney+ streaming platform in lieu of maintaining talent relationships, who loses out?  Under increased scrutiny in the late 2010s for not hiring women to helm big budget tentpole projects, the Mouse House and peer studios slowly began to exploit existing IP as a way to develop female-directed and female-led projects. This paper examines how Disney's first significant slate of female-driven tentpoles—Mulan, Raya and the Last Dragon, Cruella, Black Widow—went from highly celebrated gender parity "wins" for female filmmakers to being sacrificed in the Covid era distribution shuffle to fuel Disney+ subscribers. First, I look at how Disney executives and talent responded in trade interviews and social media to widespread criticism about gender disparities behind the camera in 2018 and 2019. Second, based on personal interviews and trade press discourse, I consider how Disney's move away from traditional distribution windowing to a day-and-date theatrical and Disney+ Premium VOD releasing in 2020 impacted above-the-line female creatives of Mulan (2020, dir. Niki Caro) and Black Widow (2021, dir. Cate Shortland). Again and again, in the years following #</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A decorated scholar-practitioner with a lifetime of music and dance training in the traditions of his village and their national-level iterations in the Nepal Army, Subi Shah wrote this manuscript based on his own experience as a flute player. He did additional research with the sahanai players of the naumati baja of his home village, Jyamrung, in Dhading. Introduction to Nepali Tunes offers a theory of melodic modes based on the musical instruments bansuri, murali, and sahanai, and discusses the relation of vernacular traditions with those holding "classical" status, illustrating his music-theoretical and social-theoretical claims with two or three notated example songs for each mode, plus his own written commentary. We assert that these instruments take on the role of "epistemic things" (Rheinberger, 1997) not simply technical objects used to produce pre-conceived sounds, but the sensory, experiential basis for understanding melody. Our broader argument, building on those of multiple ethnomusicological studies on embodiment, is that theories are not only articulated verbally, and attention to the act of performance and its technical and sensory aspects are also a way to develop, determine, and transmit theories. Subi Shah's manuscript begins to translate this embodied musical theory into words and music notation. Our scholarship aims to carry its insights forward, explaining their relevance outside the case study of Shah's central Nepali musical traditions toward a more expansive concept of what constitutes theory, and a greater appreciation for the depth of knowledge found in the vernacular artistic traditions of Nepal. This in turn is important for these traditions' cultural sustainability and continued vitality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines two manuscripts belonging to two successive provosts of Sainte-Marie (Notre-Dame) of Reims, Odalric (fl. 1025-1075) and Manasses (1075/6-1096; later archbishop, 1096-1106). The manuscripts, currently Bibliothèque municipale de Reims Mss. 15 and 1402, both bear an ex libris clearly identifying their owners. BM Reims 15 contains a variety of texts, including the capitular necrology (10th-12th century), a tripartite Psalter, a farrago of canons, an episcopal list of Reims, and the earliest known copy (I do not believe it has been identified as such) of the Textus miraculi quod Dominus ad destructionem symoniacae heresis operari dignatus est in episcopatu Florentino (on Petrus Igneus and Bishop Petrus Mezzabarbo of Florence). Its contents, added at different times from ca. 1050-, indicate that BM Reims 15 was very much a ‘working' text, a sort of reference or archive for the provost and chapter. BM Reims 1402, belonging to Manasses, is more straightforward. A passionary (hyemalis secundus), its texts focus heavily on local bishop-saints (Archbishops Remigius, Rigobertus) and fathers of the church (Pope Gregory I, Pope Sylvester, Benedict). It further contains, inserted just before the vita of Pope Gregory, four of that pontiff's letters, apparently selected for their thematic significance and, I will argue, connection to reform ideas on clerical celibacy and simony. I will argue that their manuscripts reveal the means by which the seminal ideas of church reform concerning simony and priestly conduct were introduced into the powerful archdiocese of Reims. Collectively, they suggest the ‘indirect' and often piecemeal ways in which reformist ideas were transmitted—through textual exempla and canonical farragos—which adjusts our traditional view of reform as directly conveyed through intentional canonical collections or papal fiat. BM Reims 15 and 1402 give us a taste of what church reform ‘on the ground' looked like.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My talk examines how the state repaired economic relations between private citizens through neighborhood tribunals in the 1790s. Court mandated repayment schedules sought to rehabilitate broken financial relationships and to create space for offending citizens to economically survive without ruin. This chapter illustrates how litigants' collective judicial tactics transformed the socioeconomic relationships central to urban living. These included rental relationships, commercial relationships, work relationships, and even friendships. Dovetailing statistical outcomes from the rulings with litigants' discursive descriptions of their debts, my research reveals that the ability to efficiently and affordably resolve disputes at revolutionary courts rebalanced the credit relationships that controlled the Parisian rental market and consumer sales. As a result, personal and commercial debt became more distinct from one another in ways that would underpin nineteenth-century capitalism in France.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper dissects audiences before Parisian justices of the peace to reveal how city dwellers overturned traditional power dynamics between lessors and lessees during the Revolution. Prior to the nineteenth century, principal tenants of urban "houses" (who were mostly artisans and shopkeepers) generally came from the same socioeconomic background as their subtenants (who were other artisans, small merchants, and laborers). Individuals who assumed the role of principal tenant, or the main tenant responsible for remitting all subtenants' rent to the building's owner, did so to gain spatial rather than economic advantages. Being a principal tenant offered an individual the first choice of living, working, and commercial spaces within a building. Principal tenants rarely expected to make money from subletting the remaining rooms. On the contrary, they faced significant risks and potential losses in collecting rent and state taxes from delinquent subtenants. However, following the invention of the revolutionary justices of the peace, principal tenants seized the new possibility to quickly and affordably bring contests over small sums like a single term's rent for the cheap rooms. The use and looming threat of this strategy appears to have truncated lessee's repayment windows for backrent, which was one of the most common and significant urban expenses. In effect, the justice of the peace instituted new boundaries between lessors and lessees in rental relationships and lessors deployed state institutions to gain a firm upper-hand for the first time. In the long run, lessors' newfound advantages made it possible to conceive of rental housing as a profitable investment and as arena of entrepreneurial activity in the nineteenth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ABSTRACT  The Nazi erasure of the fin de siècle city:From Vienna 1900 to E.M. Emo's Wien 1910  Vienna 1900 is now a celebrated lieu de memoire, but in the Nazi Weltanschauung it was decadent, degenerate and verjudete. The history of fin de siècle Vienna needed to be erased and rewritten, its culture eradicated to assimilate it into the Ostmark. But there was a problem with dismissing the period entirely; it was during that time, and within that milieu, that one of Hitler's most beloved role models had risen to power. Ever eager to please his master, Josef Goebbels could think of no better subject for a film than Karl Lueger, mayor of Vienna from 1897 to 1910 and a figure deeply admired by Hitler. When a script appeared in 1940 for a film about Lueger and his contemporary, the pan-Germanist Georg von Schönerer, to be produced by Wien Film, Goebbels jumped at the chance; after passing through numerous script writers, the film, directed by E.M. Emo, passed the censors in August of 1942, and had its premiere in Vienna the following April. After that, it was never shown in Vienna again.  In what way were these figures distanced in the film from their deep roots in the turn of the century city? What efforts were made to salvage these important and celebrated Viennese figures while continuing to malign and excoriate the culture in which they had risen to prominence and held sway? What selling points and strategies were used to make Wien 1910 a time and place worthy of attention for the film, as its history was simultaneously being distorted and erased? A look at the materials and discourse around the film, including the original publicity kit and materials, will attempt to show how these figures were positioned and portrayed in the film and divorced from the city that had produced them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ABSTRACT During the last three decades Viennese 1900 has exploded in popular culture and academia: in countless exhibitions dedicated to painting, architecture, and the applied arts, in myriad books on every well-known Viennese designer, and in the "Klimtomania" that covers umbrellas, scarves and shopping bags. Yet the popularity of Viennese Modernism and thecommercial "Vienna 1900" industry simultaneously obscures a problematic series of historical erasures and gaps. All too often, the glittering culture of "Vienna 1900" is studied in isolation from the political exigencies of 1938 and thereafter. Our panel will interrogate the intentional neglect and repression of specific figures, organizations and movements who have faded in the shadow of larger Viennese superstars and a now familiar narrative, or who have been intentionally white-washed. The papers will call attention to some of the "absences" linked directly to the years of 1938-1945, to the "de-Jewification" of the Viennese street scape, to the careful art historical narrative surrounding certain careers, to the reshaping of a "Vienna-in-Exile" within the artistic establishment of post-war New York. In addition, we will show how the very celebration of Vienna 1900 cannot be understood apart from the uses to which it was put following the war, for it cannot be denied, and indeed is richly ironic, that the same period suppressed in Nazi discourse has been used to suppress Austria's turbulent Nazi past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Erasing the City:The 1939 "Berge und Menschen der Ostmark" Exhibit  In March of 1939, one year after the Anschluss, the Vienna Künstlerhaus opened their doors to the enormous exhibit, Berge und Menschen der Ostmark. Filled with nearly 900 works by 238 contemporary artists, the show functioned to celebrate the rural Gaue, or regions, of former Austria. Paintings, prints, drawings, and sculptures depicted the landscape of Ostmark--and in particular its Alpine mountains--as well as its peasants, in every mood, from the banal to the sublime. Some works showed empty, meditative landscapes, while many focused on the peasant at work in the land: logging, harvesting, planting, tilling, ploughing and building. In its later manifestation in Berlin, the exhibit included an array of folk crafts, industrial products and even regional food specialities.  Although the origin of the show dated back to the period of Austro-Fascism, it took on a new urgency and message with the annexation of Austria into the Third Reich. The exhibit presented Ostmark as the "treasure-chest of the Reich" with its waterways, natural resources and farmland. It expressed, in powerful images of golden fields and soaring, snow-capped mountains, the idea of the Heimat. With its countless images of hearty farmers and braided blonde mädchen it also gave visual form to the concept of the Volksgemeinschaft.   In this paper, I argue that the show also served to erase the city. Reflecting the Blut und Boden myth of National Socialism, the hundreds of works on display elevated the rural and the regional. Yet the Berge und Menschen theme was not only anti-urban in a more general sense but also aimed to displace Vienna, capital of a multicultural Empire, as the heart of the Ostmark. Cosmopolitan and entjudete Vienna was all but ignored in the imagery, aside from its older cultural achievements.  Despite its fascinating expression of the ideological roots and political aims of the Anschluss, the exhibit has received</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The schone Wienerin, the Deutsche madchen and the absent Jewess: portraiture and cultural politics in Nazi Vienna  In 1942 the Künstlerhaus Wien opened  an exhibition titled Das schöne Wiener Frauenbild. The show was sponsored by Baldur von Schirach, Reichstatthalter of Vienna and former leader of the Hitlerjugender.. For Schirach, the show was yet another opportunity to proclaim Vienna as the cultural capital of the Third Reich, against the firect opposition of Joser Goebbals.In contrast to the peasant mother or uniformed madchen, Viennase women would be presented as glamoroius and , charming, playing directly on Vienna's history of portraiture and her reputation for flair and gemultichkeit.  The prganizers of the show adopted many  strategies to elevate Vienna's cultural achievement and her famed beauties. One was by linking the exhibit to earlier shows and contests of that nature in 1928 and 1930?? Another was to reference the tradition of Austrian biedermeier portraits, not coincidentally beloved by Adoplf Hitler.. Yet another strategy , the focus of my paper, was specifically to focus on Vienna as a fashion capital of Europe. This played directly to Balder von Schirach's  interest, as he repeatedly aimed to establish Vienna as a city to rival Paris. The show linked to this trope of Vienna while  counterpoising the uniformed madchen and peasant mother to the more charming Viennese beauty. Sheserved as a foil not only to the more pracical GErman hausfrau, but also to the Neue Fraue, who had claimed the fashion spotlight in the decade earlier.   It was impossible, however, to mount such an exhibition without evoking the missing Jewess, who had dominated not only fashion, but Viennse. By 1942 her image had been laregly erased, just as the women themselves had been deported and the city made largely judenfrei. I will argue, however, that the absent presence of the Jewss continued to haunt the 1942 exhibition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This roundtable on description in the novel took place on May 3, 2016, at the Mahindra Humanities Center at Harvard University. Concluding the inaugural year of the Novel Theory Seminar, the roundtable featured presentations by Wai Chee Dimock, Heather Love, William Mills Todd III, J. Keith Vincent, and Cynthia Wall. To solicit brief position papers from each of these scholars, who represent five different areas of expertise within literary studies, we sent them the following prompt:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Questions to consider might involve, for instance, the ways in which description has been pivotal for the novel as a literary form that aims to amalgamate fictionality with referentiality; how description is (or isn't) surplus to the requirements of plot; how description serves to thicken and/or spatialize time while it suspends story; how it contributes to the modeling of fictional worlds; how it secures (or doesn't) the boundaries between persons and things, characters and settings; and whether and how literary description differs from other descriptive modes and practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When we read the early African American print archive, citizenship quickly emerges as a key term and vexed concept.  Absalom Jones's 1799 petition to Congress for instance, claimed citizenship for his fellow petitioners and for enslaved people "in common with ourselves and every other class of citizens within the jurisdiction of the United States."  Claiming citizenship here not only signaled a rhetorical sense of belonging and political status, but also posited a definition of citizenship that went beyond contemporary legal restrictions and rights discourse. Using Frances Ellen Watkins Harper as a focus, my commentary will develop a genealogy of black thought on citizenship between 1799 and 1859.  Harper's work—poetry praising Margaret Garner, essays challenging readers to aid fugitive slaves, and fiction connecting a seventeenth-century Brazilian quilombo to the black convention movement and free black parlors—was often retrospective, stories about the past crafted to link domestic pedagogy to radical practices.  This wide-ranging work offers a syllabus, one both celebratory and critical (particularly of gender exclusions), that provides a useful launch point for exploring and reassessing black writing on citizenship in the early Republic.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Frances E. W. Harper and Wilson J. Wilson's serial sketches published in the Anglo-African Magazine (1859-1860) represent an experience of being on the verge—of hope, despair, and revolution.  The form—fragmented, contingent, yet linear—propelled readers to the next installment, while Harper and Wilson's narratives concerning history, the sectional crisis, and revolt review a disjunctive past imbricated and sometimes simultaneous with the "future that is before us."  Harper's "Fancy Sketches" and "Triumph of Freedom" overlay hemispheric great time with the immediacy of antebellum freedom struggles, as characters read the history of Quilombo dos Palmares (a seventeenth century Brazilian maroon republic) and dream of David Walker's activism and John Brown's raid as both myth and prophesy.  Wilson's "Ethiop" translates an "ancient" tablet from the year 4000 telling of the destruction of the "Amecans," a long gone "milk white race." The text links temporality to form, as Ethiop wonders if the tablet is "fiction…history…or prophecy."  These acts of reading (and authoring) suggest that for Wilson and Harper pinpointing one form and one temporality isn't as important as indeterminacy's unsettling effects:  the "Agitation" it produces and the futures it makes thinkable.  Their textual encounters frame time as a tangle of future histories, a revolution ongoing and yet-to-come.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper asks how the literature of citizenship and revolution looked for those who simultaneously celebrated a new relation to the state, but who also recognized the persistence of white supremacy, both North and South. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper's revisions of pre-War poems and sketches after the Civil War to register the sense that while the War's final outcome and the subsequent Reconstruction amendments were a victory of sorts, revolution was an ongoing process of deconstruction and reconstruction that does not repeat events in the antebellum north, but does "rhyme" with them. Even as poems like the "Aunt Chloe" cycle narrate transitions from enslavement to freedom, freedom to citizenship, and citizenship to voting, they also highlight the tensions between a franchise predicated on manhood, southern politicians' efforts to reassert their authority by violence and bribery, and the work of "women radicals" like Chloe on the ground. Harper's revisions to poems like "Truth," similar to the reconstruction amendments, suggest progress, but also reveal an interlocking and simultaneous set of experiments for which Harper and others could only, in the moment, offer sketches or outlines that were simultaneously descriptive of the narrative "now," proleptic, and at the same time framed through generic conventions developed over the past two decades. The contiguities and tensions between Harper's pre-War work, then, direct us to question not only the forms literature and citizenship took during black reconstructions, but also how form and content registered the indeterminate and vexed nature of reconstruction itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will argue that the relationship between sacred and secular in the early seventeenth century played out in a complex and interactive relationship staged by the conduct of public worship and in the interactive character of preaching as quasi-theatrical events in specific locales and occasions. Donne's role in worship took place on occasions enabled by the Book of Common Prayer; his preaching, which he sometimes opposed rhetorically to the theater, shared with the theater a wide range of audience expectations for the use of costumes, clearly-defined stages, and active engagement with the assembled congregation. This transformation of worship played out in spaces which were themselves engaged in contested relationships between sacred and secular. Our digital models of St Paul's Cathedral and Paul's Churchyard (vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu) foreground the complexities of these interactions during Donne's time as Dean of the cathedral. The cathedral's nave ceased being the site of festival processions or the site of chancery chapels where masses were said for the dead, becoming instead Paul's Walk, the notorious site where the fashionable came to gossip and lawyers, prostitutes, and pickpockets plied their trades, interrupting the round of daily offices that continued to be sung in the cathedral's Choir. In Paul's Churchyard, the sacred world of cloisters and charnel houses gave way to a complex mix of sacred and secular; Paul's Churchyard functioned both as a working graveyard and an increasingly commercial area where the proliferation of bookshops made Paul's Churchyard into the commercial center of the English book trade. So formerly sacred spaces could shelter community and commercial activities while regaining a sense of a transformed sacred space through public ceremonies and occasions like the Paul's Cross sermons, which while theologically instructive were also the most entertainment one could find in London for free on a Sunday morning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Following recent studies on global approaches to the humanities, this paper details the development of a first-year seminar designed to investigate the divide between Western and non-Western traditions in art history. It explores a plurality of approaches to the enduring question, what is the significance of art to humanity? Thematic and object-driven, it engages a comparative perspective on the role of art in diverse cultures throughout history. Primary source readings extend across disciplines to encourage critical debate, and team-based projects offer avenues for adapting this model to larger classroom settings. This paper examines how the design and experience of teaching a global seminar at the undergraduate level not only extends beyond the bounds of any art historical specialty, but also tests the methods and pedagogical practices standard in our discipline today. At the foundational level, this course aims to mediate the west/non-west divide and inspire a global conversation in our classrooms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Plato postulated that the human body partakes from a lower material order characterized by change and decay (the order of becoming) and that the soul belongs to a higher and unchanging eternal order (the order of being), a proposition that set in motion a millennial concern with questions about body and soul, and with attendant theories and beliefs about mortality/immortality, materialism/idealism, sacred/profane, being/becoming, etc. Arguably all canonical schools have grappled with body/soul or body/mind questions, including Christianity, Idealism, Materialism, Romanticism, Rationalism, Phenomenology, or indeed Third Wave Feminism. Beyond philosophy and theology, these themes have also marked the arts, literature, and poetry, and canonical artists and writers have provided their own footnotes to Platonic dualism. This paper traces the genealogy of these debates about body and soul and discusses the extent to which an evolving body/soul rhetoric marked the development of the humanities in the West.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, hundreds of African North Americans returned to fight for the U.S. Army, and thousands more returned to the United States in the decades that followed. At the same time, hundreds of men, women, and children traveled north to Canada, even after emancipation. Time in Canada gave African North Americans the power of comparison: When struggling for access to social and political participation and economic opportunity in the United States, these individuals had a reference point in British North America (Canada), a similar but distinct Anglo-American society with a different history of slavery, emancipation, and claims for equal rights. This paper places African North American political actions, economic choices, and cultural arguments within a transnational context, providing a new understanding of the source of political and cultural currents in U.S. history from the beginnings of the Underground Railroad to the death of the emancipation generation (roughly 1830-1920), expanding the geographic scope of Reconstruction and of African American history northward. It outlines the importance of the idea as well as the reality of Canada for these African North Americans, and then considers why the aftermath of the well-known Underground Railroad history has received so little attention.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Collaboration has been integral to the study of the San Bartolo murals since it was first discovered in 2001. On the initial trip to document and contextualize the murals within the yet unknown site of San Bartolo, archaeologists (2), epigrapher, artist, and conservation scientist all brought their expertise to focus on the stunning painting peeking out of construction fill. For me, collaborative research opened an entirely new line of inquiry regarding how art was made, in addition to what the images were and asking why they were created. This paper will briefly summarize two results that are the product of collaborative practice: the application of a scientific lens to verify artist's hand and distinctive pigments used to mark symbolic significance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We propose a multi-institutional, interactive panel composed of National Endowment for the Humanities Enduring Questions faculty grant recipients. Humanities faculty from various disciplines, including English and art history, reflect on the ways in which honors courses are particularly well suited to be incubators of question-driven courses that foster lasting intellectual community through study of the humanities, regardless of major.  This panel provides diverse models of NEH-funded courses in which faculty and students together pursue enduring questions in the humanities—including questions of justice—and advance student learning outcomes of deepening and enhancing student appreciation, through in and out-of-class experiences, for the humanities. In addition, the panel emphasizes interdisciplinary explorations of literature, drama, philosophy, the visual arts, music, and film, and other creative forms of expression.  The session encourages participant questions, observations, and practices within their respective honors communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How might one model expert reading of early modern archives? While the question may seem unanswerable, emerging methods may well make its exploration possible. Taking Peter W. M. Blayney's The Bookshops in Paul's Cross Churchyard as test case suggests both points and paths of entry.  Published in 1990, Blayney's work captivates scholars through its extensive, detailed, reconstructive mapping of the churchyard and its shops.  Yet these images' seeming solidity belies the varied, intersecting forms of evidence required for their creation. Here, the layers of access digital media provide stand poised to fuel the curiosity that stimulates research. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Tracing the citations of this 1990 text yields a sample of document types vital to its "book-trade topography," including early modern wills, leases, visitation books, and State Papers (Foreign and Domestic), to name a few. With characteristic humility, Blayney's Introduction presents this research as a "skim" for "immediately useful facts."  Such a sense of salience results from the ability to identify key points rapidly through deep understanding of ways early modern documents and individuals may intersect. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Encoding a range of Blayney's sources, with an eye to marking major entity types each contains, electronically reconstitutes a document-based context where characteristic patterns of relation may be considered further. Tools such as Dromio hold the potential to facilitate initial transcription and tagging of these texts, resulting in a digitized body of early modern evidence within which one may hone strategies for modeling the same, while setting groundwork for forms of search able to encourage further engagement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This was a lecture given at a conference held at the Department of Philosophy, University of Ottawa for the contributors to the volume "A Companion to James of Viterbo,"  an Augustinian master of theology at the University of Paris during the end of the thirteenth century. My lecture outlined his theory of free will, which was based on the doctrine of "the two affections of will" originated by Anselm of Canterbury.  The appropriation of the Anselmian doctrine by James was one of the most original in the medieval period prior to its important development by John Duns Scotus.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper identifies the immediate sources from which Duns Scotus constructed his own, much discussed version of Anselm of Canterbury's theory of the two affections of the will. I show that Scotus developed his theory not directly from Anselm but from the late-thirteenth-century debates at Paris over free will and, in particular, from Henry of Ghent's lengthy, critical analysis of Anselm's doctrine. The immediate occasion for Henry's extensive analysis of Anselm's two affections was the specific solution to the free will problem advanced by the Franciscan John of Murro, who attempted to merge Anselm with Aquinas's resolution based on his innovative distinction between the exercise and specification of an act. Henry rejected Murro's interpretation of Aquinas, just as he had forcefully rejected Aquinas's original solution, but did so only after a treatise length commentary on Anselm. It was from Henry's analysis of Anselm, the first and most substantial in the scholastic period, that Scotus's took his own theory of the two affections, including his controversial claim that the affection for justice is the "native freedom of the will." Henry's treatment permits both a more informed interpretation of Scotus's somewhat elliptical discussion of Anselm's two affections as well as a more accurate estimation of his contribution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries political, religious, and medical elites attempted to decommodify alcohol and other psychoactive drugs whose use had become problematic in an industrializing, urbanizing, and nationally competitive world. The global movement toward restriction and prohibition was, in one sense, ironic. For practically all of human history, alcohol and other food-drugs had actually functioned as means of elite control, aggrandizement, and imperial expansion. As early as 1953 anthropologists put forward the suggestion that civilization itself, without which there would be no elites as we know them, arose in response to the quest for more dependable supplies of alcohol.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This paper reviews and critically assess the anthropological, historical, and scientific literature on alcohol, food-drugs, social class, gender, the Neolithic transition, and early civilizations. It argues that, through such practices as competitive feasting and labor pacification, alcohol and other food-drugs did strongly reinforce the hierarchical and gendered labor tendencies inherent to early civilizations. Brewing and food-drug agriculture also helped to spring what historian Yuval Noah Harari has called "the luxury trap," creating patterns of work and trade that kept commoners on a labor treadmill, punctuated by occasional sprees, while their male overlords enjoyed the lion's share of the harvests. The paper concludes by showing how these early developments established an enduring pattern, with substance abuse and addiction—and, more generally, all forms of escapist vice—being paradoxically concentrated in the lower and upper social strata of adult male populations. That pattern persisted throughout history, until the situation became sufficiently fraught with moral and strategic risk that late-modern reformers and policy makers could no longer ignore it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the promises of digital humanities is to connect diverse communities through digital projects, transcending traditional limitations of access and public participation. In August 2013, Great Basin College was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Challenge Grant to develop a virtual humanities center to embrace the 86,000 square mile service area which we serve. A central goal of the project is to connect the various communities in the area, whose size and low population density preclude traditional humanities-oriented projects. In the first three years of the project, the Virtual Humanities Center (VHC) at Great Basin College has built projects with two separate communities within our region. The first is the Basque community in Elko desiring to preserve and promote their cultural legacy in the region. The second project comprises seventeen communities of Western Shoshone of northeastern Nevada, whose current interest is Shoshoni language preservation and revitalization using digital techniques to link the communities. These projects have required the VHC to work with numerous institutions, ranging from ethnic social clubs to local museums to academic archives in two states, to develop digital humanities projects. This paper will discuss the challenges involved in promoting and developing digital humanities among such a diverse range of partners, from explaining digital humanities to managing standards and legal obligations across various groups and institutions. A particular emphasis will be placed on community curation and the experiences of insuring that community interests and ownership of the projects were promoted and protected.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines Native American word lists and their circulation in Native space, which created opportunities for recontextualization and re-evaluation.  It focuses in particular on eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Anglo-American projects to collect and arrange indigenous words, which were inspired by Thomas Jefferson's comments in Notes on the State of Virginia that it was "very much to be lamented" that colonists had "suffered so many of the Indian tribes already to extinguish" before men of science had "collected" the "rudiments" of their languages.  Attempting to make up for lost opportunities, in Notes Jefferson compiled word lists from multiple sources to create a table that linked Natives' languages with their geographic location.  He continued this project in the 1790s, when he created a word list after meeting Unquachog people on Long Island and when he had printed blanks published and distributed to Indian agents, missionaries, government officials, and soldiers.  The lists' material form was designed to elicit particular results: the printed lists of English words and blanks were to be filled in with corresponding Native words.  The lists aimed to ensure that collectors would obtain the same set of words, thus making comparison across multiple languages and conclusions about the relations of those languages and the origins of the people who spoke them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1943 Allied bombs destroyed the archives of Leoncavallo's publisher, Sonzogno, and the Teatro Dal Verme, where  Pagliacci  was first performed. In light of the resulting scarcity of sources pertaining to the opera's compositional history, scholarship has relied almost exclusively on Leoncavallo's autobiographical "Appunti." Contextual sources such as notifications in the press, eyewitness accounts, and a large body of mostly unpublished correspondence now suggest that Leoncavallo cloaked the opera's genesis to protect its legacy.&amp;#x0D; Leoncavallo was twice charged with having imitated an existing play (in 1893 Tamayo y Baus's  Un drama nuevo , and in 1894 Catulle Mendès's  La femme de Tabarin ). In his protracted defense, he took every opportunity to distinguish his libretto from the literary tradition (of Tabarin-like "plays within a play") to which it belongs and tie it instead to the verismo movement (with which some critics had associated it since the premiere). He began to claim, for instance, that the libretto was based on a crime of passion he had witnessed in Montalto and invented a version of that crime that matched the libretto. Furthermore, in preparation of the first performance in Paris in 1902, he actively contributed to a staging that was to faithfully depict Montalto and the costumes of its people. And as he was tightening the opera's connection to verismo, he was concealing aspects that would have reflected poorly on the opera's reception, including Sonzogno's concerns regarding the quality of the work and the presence of musical borrowings--most notably two substantial, newly identified sections, taken from the composer's French chamber work  La coupe et les lèvres --in the opera's conclusion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Reproducing experimental results is a hallmark of empirical investigation and serves both to verify and inspire. This paper is a call for more systematic documentation of computational stylistic experiments. Publishing only summaries of the methods and results of empirical work is an artifact of traditional print media. To facilitate experimental reproducibility and to help the growing community who wish to learn how to apply computational methods and subsequently teach the next generation of scholars, the publication of results must include (i) access to the digitized texts, (ii) a clear workflow and most essentially (iii) the source code that led to each and all of the experimental results. By way of example, we present the steps and process in a GitHub repository for computationally probing the unknown and contested authorship of an 1831 short story entitled "A Dream" as we seek evidence if this work is similar to other attributed works by Edgar Allan Poe. The entire framework is intended as a pedagogical jumpstart for others, especially those new to computational stylometry. If Poe did write the story, it would be his first published work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public health was crucial to the success of the American pacification campaign and the "civilizing process" in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. In 1905, American colonial officials established a leper colony in Culion, southwest of Manila. To safeguard public health, officials deemed it necessary to forcibly remove "lepers" from their homes; however, in 1907, citing limited resources and the difficulty of pregnancy for women with leprosy, they banned cohabitation and marriage within Culion. Colonial officials had downplayed Filipino leprosy patients' opposition to the segregation order. But how did female patients respond to the segregation policy? How did they engage with authorities over such issues as the ban on cohabitation and marriage?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This paper advances our understanding of the engagement between Filipino women leprosy patients and colonial officials. This is an understudied theme in literature on empire, medicine, and public health, and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Very few studies of Culion address patients' – mostly men – oppositional views and practices. I argue that female patients, individually and collectively, asserted their sense of self and in so doing, rejected the notion of women as weak, mere followers of the male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars of rhetoric and political communication have for decades argued that the rise of television transformed rhetoric's political spaces. Yet television was not the first visual medium to do so; other visual antecedents are worth attending to as well. Beginning in the late 1920s, a new kind of photography appeared in Europe and the United States, made possible by small, portable cameras capable of producing intimate photographs of seemingly unguarded subjects. These "miniature" or "candid cameras" provided photographers with a decidedly different way to picture political actors. Of the dramatic difference between the candid camera and its heavier, larger predecessors, one writer of the era said it was like an "express rifle had been substituted for a pea shooter."   In 1929, the term "candid camera" was coined by the London Daily Graphic to describe the work of German photographer Erich Salomon, whose specialty became the photography of political spaces. Salomon made unposed images of European leaders and diplomats at international conferences and later brought his candid camera to bear on political elites in the U.S. This paper analyzes Salomon's photographs and the public conversation about them to show how the candid camera transformed ideas about political space in Europe and the U.S. between 1928-1932. By taking advantage of the candid camera's ability to foreshorten the physical space between photographer and subject, Salomon's images offered the political sphere new visual values of access, intimacy, and energy. The project illustrates the value of attending to those historically-specific moments when technological change reshapes our real and imagined rhetorical-political spaces.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bin Jelmood House, part of the Msheireb heritage complex of museums in Doha, Qatar opened in October 2015. This museum is dedicated to the history of slavery, part to its wider global dimensions starting in the ancient world and part to its regional history (especially the 19th and 20th centuries). The museum includes narratives of runaway slaves in the 20th century, collected by the British India Office to facilitate their manumission. These British archival records have also been digitized as part of the Qatar Digital Library (www.qdl.qa). This paper will attempt an analysis of the building of Bin Jelmood House and the reported reaction of descendants of slaves and slave-owners to its building and contrast the Bin Jelmood experience with contemporary efforts at organization by Arabian residents of African descent. This analysis endeavors to shed light on the question "Is there an African diaspora in the Middle East?" by finding out whether there is more, less or any evidence of diaspora self-identification in efforts to represent itself in public spaces. This includes looking at whether Afro-Arabian people might be participating in a kind of public history – genealogical research. Newspaper reports, social media posts, any publicly available data analytics from the qdl.qa site and interviews with experts consulted for the Bin Jelmood House project and participants in burgeoning Afro-Arabian advocacy groups will be the basis of this paper.

		<Abstract>When considering the artistic landscape in which George Gershwin matured, it is easy to imagine the theaters, concert halls, and opera houses of New York City as a succession of cultural silos. Musicologists have tended to study popular entertainments such as vaudeville, musical comedies, Yiddish theater, and opera as if they were isolated from each other – each style with its own performers, impresarios, influences, and traditions. But, in fact, the entertainers, businessmen, and patrons who powered the engine of the New York cultural scene traveled easily between genres on stage and met each other after hours at the same parties. It was this smorgasbord of dance, theater, and music that nurtured Gershwin in the early years of the twentieth century. Using "Blue Monday," (1922), a one-act opera written for a revue as a case study, I argue that Gershwin's restless search throughout his career for ways to integrate popular and classical music was a logical reaction to his early musical surroundings, which promoted constant genre crossing, sometimes for aesthetic reasons, but also to make larger political or social points through humor and references to cultural touchstones. This short work exemplifies the ways that Gershwin used music to trouble musical, class, and racial boundaries at the same moment that critics were succeeding in creating a cultural hierarchy based upon those same criteria. Seen in this light, Gershwin's music clings to a pre-World War I musical and theatrical aesthetic that valued deft stylistic flexibility that many of his contemporaries eventually abandoned.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay considers the literary taste of African American women readers of the Black Chicago Renaissance during the 1940s. Perhaps the most popular group of these readers was The Book Circle, a local reading club that ran from 1943 through 1993 on the city's South Side neighborhood of Bronzeville. Organized by and for African American women during World War II to "boost morale," The Book Circle met monthly to discuss current works by Bronzeville authors such as Gwendolyn Brooks and Richard Wright. This reading group documented its activities in meticulous records—including constitutions, agendas, photographs, meeting minutes, and scrapbooks—that give insight into their reading habits, reception practices, and literary taste. By analyzing these archival materials in the context of the literature the group read, I illustrate how central the social practices of community reading on the South Side were to writers such as Brooks and Wright. This essay thus offers a detailed assessment of the relationship between private book circles in Bronzeville and some of the neighborhood's most famous writers and texts. In so doing, it also attempts to correct what Elizabeth McHenry has called "the historical invisibility of black readers." Indeed, while the work of McHenry, Joycelyn Moody, P. Gabrielle Foreman, Eric Gardner, and other scholars who recover forgotten African American literary communities has focused primarily on eighteenth-and nineteenth-century reading practices, this essay restores an important visibility of twentieth-century black readers, thus recognizing the influence of literary reception outside the academy in the mid twentieth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The project focuses on a prosopography of the early Stuart diplomatic service (1603-1649) and networks among its members. The author described how she gathers, structures, analyzes, and visualizes biographical data associated with early Stuart diplomatic representatives. Discovering the patterns and connections in this data can help answer questions related to the increasing professionalization of the diplomatic service, among others. Learning more about factors such as the diplomats' educational preparation, social status and mobility, career paths, and religious and political networks can provide a fuller and more nuanced understanding of the service's evolution as an institution, as well as its role in operationalizing English foreign policy in this key period leading up to the Civil War and Interregnum. The project data are drawn from heterogeneous sources. One of the project's goals is to produce a combined, enhanced data set on early Stuart diplomats to which related projects can readily link via standard identifiers and common data structures. The author presented her on-going project, the current state of her research, and shared preliminary results in this poster session.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) is a digital toolkit that facilitates and supports prosopographical research, including the disambiguation of namesakes and the generation of social network visualizations. Although BPS originated in support for research in a corpus of cuneiform legal documents of the Hellenistic period, its corpus agnostic architecture supports investigation of the names and individuals in text corpora regardless of their time periods, languages, content, or media. It applies heuristics familiar to the humanities researcher, including the application of probabilistic reasoning in the disambiguation of namesakes and the positing and exploration of "what if" scenarios that invite the formation of new research agendas. This paper outlines the conceptual framework of BPS and will demonstrate the functionality of BPS and its potential to support prosopographical research in papyrology, drawing on text subsets from the Center for the Tebtunis Papyri, and will suggest its applicability to research in Biblical, Early Jewish, and Christian Studies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>OSTMARK AS BULWARK: AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS AND THE EAST IN THE NAZI IMAGINARY  In March of 1938 Austria ceased to exist. It became the Ostmark, or Eastern Marches of the Third Reich. With the annexation of this territory, the Reich gained more than material treasures and a landscape of family pleasures. The Ostmark became the final frontier, the last stronghold against the human and racial "pollution" that lay beyond its border. The former Austria was no longer  a gateway to Eastern Europe, but rather its barricade. Despite the term Ostmark, the regions of former Austria were not liminal places between two cultures, but the last stretches of the "not East".  The transformation of Austria into the Ostmark--or rather its "reversion", according to Nazi history-- back to the eastern-most part of the German Reich was accompanied by a flurry  of publications including history books, exhibition catalogues, tourist brochures and popular journals. The notion of  Ostmark als Bolwerke forms a leitmotif throughout both  "scholarly" and popular texts.The famed mountains of Carinthia, Styria and Burgenland were hailed as the natural walls preserving the racial purity and Aryan blood of the Germanic populations.  In contrast to the rural, mountainous regions, standing as guardians against the encroach of the slavs, the city of Vienna could not into fit easily into this narrative. It was not only situated at the eastern reaches of the Ostmark, but in Nazi ideology--and certainly in the view of Adolf Hitler-- the city had been poisoned by its proximity to the East. As is well known, in Mein Kampf Hitler described his first encounter with a turbaned Ostjuden on the streets of Vienna. As the seat of the Hapsburg Empire,  but also as the most "Eastern" of Austrian cities, Vienna remained suspect throughout the years of the Third Reich.  In this paper I look at the construction of the Ostmark in Nazi discourse and publication, with special attention to its role as Bolwerke. It was in the Os</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I suggest some connections between Laws of Form and what Husserl called the "strange world of the purely logical." Specifically, I talk about: Husserl's background, especially as a mathematician, and his use of symbolic notation. Then, I compare his and Spencer-Brown's views on: the relationship between mathematics and logic, mentioning Boole; the fundamental particles from which numbers can be made; the structure of knowledge of the universe, especially Husserl's theory of manifolds; imaginary entities; Russell's theory of types. For lack of time, I only mention Spencer-Brown's and Russell's exchange on propositional functions and Husserl's theories about them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Live and dead animals played complex roles at Mycenae, Greece during the Late Bronze Age. Archaeological remains of non-human animal bodies provide insights into how they were treated as sources of food, raw materials, symbolism, and how they lived as active companions and members of past societies. Abundant animal remains were recovered from Petsas House, a residence used for ceramic production and storage at Mycenae. They were found with an array of materials, including ceramic vessels and architectural debris in a well deposit, which likely formed shortly following a destructive earthquake. Previous analysis of the well fauna, dating to the LH III A2 period (14th c. BCE), revealed abundant livestock remains, including young pigs that point to some local pig management. This paper will utilize zooarchaeological analysis to delve into the domesticated animal populations that were raised, culled, used, and deposited in the extra-palatial well context. We focus on the demography and body-part representation of pigs and caprines (sheep and goats). The results are compared to the taphonomic history of the deposit to better relate the evidence of past animal management to animal use by the artisan residents.  Notably, we detected structured culling and variable carcass completeness for the pigs, sheep, and goats. This reflects some general access to locally managed and butchered populations and more specific indirect access to select parts of sheep likely produced for wool. These results are used to decenter the picture of Mycenaean animal use, commonly based on Linear B textual evidence of palatial interests in sheep. Ultimately, our findings reflect how a single household of artisans had different levels of direct and indirect engagement with specific taxa. This provides new insights into human-animal boundaries across different social realms of Mycenae.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Raphael's frescoes in the Stanza della Segnatura, once the private library of Julius II, manifest a monumental thesis on Renaissance theories of word and image. The rediscovery of the Stanza's collection of deluxe volumes demonstrates that the chamber was animated by a recursive chain of media, from painting to text. Using 3D technologies to reunite the books and the frescoes, this panoramic reconstruction illuminates new dimensions of the Stanza's experience for its early visitors and elucidates the synergistic intellectual web on which the room's design was predicated. It asks: How was the Stanza engaged by its early modern audience? How might the spatial analysis of the pope's literary collection shape our interpretation of the chamber's meaning? How does the relationship of text and image inform our understanding of Renaissance cultures of reading? And how do these investigations inform current urgent discussions about what a library has been and could become?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Schliemann's unprecedented excavations at Mycenae paved the way for almost 150 years of archaeological investigations focused on the elite people that have come to exemplify the site in the Late Bronze Age. While Schliemann's campaigns focused on elite burials "rich in gold", most of the ecofacts "rich in data" were overlooked in the early days of archaeology at the site. This includes the archaeological remains of animals from Mycenae that reflect ubiquitous and versatile faunal resources. As the consumption of faunal resources transcends political and social hierarchies, animals served as wealth on the hoof and permeated most aspects of past social life. Animals were not absent from early Mycenaean narratives; yet, animal roles were largely based on imagery/iconography which reflected not only elite lives, but idealized elite experiences and relationships with the natural world. For example, interpretations of the iconic stag hunt signet ring from shaft grave IV and boars tusk helmets are associated with wild animal hunting for status and power. In more recent research of animals at Mycenae and throughout the Mycenaean world, the focus has shifted to studies of feasting on meaty animal parts. However, animal remains preserve even more detailed information about Mycenaean subsistence practice and how it relates to social inequality, economic change, and human-environmental interactions.    Here, we present findings from our ongoing faunal study of Petsas House, Mycenae, with a focus on cattle. We discuss several advances in faunal research that have furthered the wider narrative of subsistence practice at the site, including recent isotopic and spatial analysis. Context-based analysis of the faunal refuse from this industrial-domestic complex provides new insights into the lived experiences of fauna down to the individual level. Together, these scientific research advancements enable us to move beyond Schliemann's goals and address questions of subsistence practice</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Capital punishment was a key element in the mechanism of colonial repression in French Senegal. Although it was first introduced in 1824, soon after the French recaptured Senegal in 1817, concerns for capital punishment and capital crimes emerged in Senegal as early as the 1780s, a time of booming French trade in the region. Yet, capital punishment was not fully enforced until 1899 when took place in Saint-Louis, the colony's administrative capital, the first public guillotine execution. A defining moment in the history of punishment in Senegal, this first execution charts the ways in which capital punishment had evolved in Senegal but also the complexities inherent in its practice.  This paper examines the historical context of the introduction, evolution, and transformation of capital punishment in Senegal with special attention to the legislation and politics of the death penalty. Its main objective is to analyze its impact on the development of the colonial state by showing how it was conceptualized and contextualized. This paper asks: How did capital punishment fit into the larger project of colonial repression in Senegal? How, why, and when, it did become institutionalized as a form of punishment? How has it evolved over time? What it tells us about France's rule of law in Senegal but also about legal justice and hegemonic rule in the colonial context? By responding to these questions, this paper will contribute to African penal histories and the global history of punishment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Capital punishment was a key element in the mechanism of colonial repression in French Senegal. Introduced in Senegal in 1824; it was not fully enforced until the late 1890s when took place in Saint-Louis the first public guillotine execution, setting in motion the machinery of death and the wheels of capital punishment in France's oldest colony in West Africa. This paper investigates the history of capital punishment in Senegal. It explores the role it played to mete out punishment and to maintain law, order, and security. It also analyses its role in building colonial citizenship/statehood. Its main objective is to analyze the evolution of capital punishment and its impact on the development of the colonial state in French Senegal by showing how death sentences were constructed. By contributing to a broader history of capital punishment in Africa and the global debates about the death penalty, the paper will address the following questions: How did capital punishment fit into the larger project of colonial repression in Senegal? How were capital crimes constructed? When was it institutionalized as a form of punishment?  The paper is organized into three parts. The first part discusses the contextualization and conceptualization of capital punishment in colonial Senegal. The second one centers on its institutionalization and how the implementation of judicial reforms in French West Africa shaped its practice over time. Part three examines the dynamics of capital trials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Frank Tannenbaum is now best-known for his pioneering contributions to the field of Latin American history.  But in a number of different ways, he was a highly unusual candidate for this scholarly distinction.  A relatively poor Yiddish-speaking immigrant who spent a year in prison before ever attending college, Tannenbaum displayed little interest in Latin America during his early years of engagement with the world of scholarship.  His first three books had nothing to do with Latin America, and his first two proposals for a dissertation in Economics (not History) were focused on crime and labor relations.  How then did Tannenbaum end up becoming a leading historian of Latin America?  I argue here that his fascination with the Mexican Revolution, the appeal of a less racially stratified society, and his personal experience working as a correspondent in Mexico City during the 1920s served to shift his interest in a Latin American direction.  Finally, the unexpected opportunity to join the Columbia history faculty consolidated his identity as a historian of Latin America but did not erase his interest in other fields.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Tip of the Iceberg Protest and Resistance in an Authoritarian Regime Leslie E. Anderson and Won-ho Park Abstract  This paper grows out of a larger project on democratic decline in Nicaragua.   That project examines the gradual breakdown of Nicaragua's democracy between 2006 and today.  During that time, Nicaragua moved from being a developing democracy to becoming a hybrid regime to being a fully authoritarian regime.  The project shows how democracy declined in Nicaragua, owing largely to gradual power aggrandizement by Daniel Ortega.  Ortega won the 2006 election, the nation's last free election.  National elections since then have been increasingly fraudulent.  Citizens initially acquiesced in Ortega's non-constitutional accumulation of power because of generous social programs that he provided, funded by Venezuela. Citizen support for Ortega changed in April 2018, when Nicaragua's population exploded in protest against him.  The protesters initially called only for the reinstatement of social security benefits, which Ortega had cancelled.  However, his brutal repression of the protesters caused them to demand his ouster.  The protests crashed the economy and attracted international attention but failed to oust Ortega.   This paper uses public opinion data to scrutinize the extent of opposition to the Ortega regime.  We examine citizen involvement in the protests but find protest participation to be only the tip of the iceberg; opposition runs much deeper.  We then compare citizen support for open street protest with two additional forms of resistance:  1) something that we call soft protest and 2) support for a national dialogue to remove Ortega under negotiated circumstances.  Soft protest is more organized and effective than everyday resistance  but less dangerous than street protest in a repressive setting.  Support for the national dialogue is an attitude rather than an act of resistance and uncovers further the depth of passive, cautious opposition to O</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Charters, obituaries, accounts, aldermen's registers, tax records, and chronicles attest to the many foundations made across northern Europe for liturgy and music. Using a foundation history of the Marian feast of the 'Recollectio festorum beate Marie virginis' of Cambrai and the daily mass before the Van Eycks' 'Adoration' of the Lamb' in Ghent, I show how documents about foundations are of broader consequence for dating manuscripts, interpreting paintings, and reconstructing a broader history of worship after 1300.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Argued that the Library of Congress manuscript was copied in Affligem but that the treatise in it, the 'Musica' of John of Affligem, was written at the Abbey of St. Peter's in Ghent, an entirely new interpretation of the manuscript and the treatise. The Abbey of Affligem was established by men sent from St. Peter's Abbey and the conductus copied at the end of the manuscript by Philip the Chancellor arrived when his successor in Paris, Guiard of Laon, came to stay at the Abbey of Affligem at the end of his life. Michel Huglo had previously argued for an origin of the LOC manuscript at Affligem for other reasons. St. Peter's Abbey of Ghent had never been associated with this treatise, but it flourished in the 10th-12th c. as a center of learning and early manuscripts of theory with musical notation survive from it. My arguments analyzed the musical notation in the manuscript and the citations of chants in the treatise. [My research is ongoing because it was limited by the pandemic.]</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past four hundred years of scholarship, prevailing concerns with the evidentiary value of the letters of Ignatius have prevented consideration of the literary and narrative potential of this collection. This paper takes up the recent revival of interest in ancient epistolary fiction to consider the question: Can the letters of Ignatius be read as a work of fiction? What signs might suggest fictionality to us? (Would they suggest the same to ancient readers?) In order to gain traction on these questions, I closely analyze the correspondence between Ignatius of Mary of Cassabola which opens the so-called "Long Recension" of the collection. I argue that the Long Recension has a clear narrative arc and erotic undertones familiar from the ancient novels. This realization suggests that early phases of the letter collection, too, might have such "fictional" features.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How do we remember the American Revolution? Many of the ways in which memory is preserved is predicated on privilege. Loyalty oaths, which officially declared whether someone was a loyalist or a patriot, were only (initially) administered to white, property-owning men. State assemblies invited neither women nor free black nor formerly enslaved people to participate in such discussions. Even the British, who offered Black Americans freedom in exchange for their loyalty, did so mostly to encourage the collapse of the Southern economy, so dependent upon slave labor. Thus, finding Black-authored Revolutionary-era texts is complicated by archives that privileged white statesmen over black writers and speakers who were denied a voice during the war. Work that has been done on blackness during the American Revolution has focused largely on recovery or slave rebellions. Phillis Wheatley excepted, scholarship about black-authored texts during the war remains woefully thin.  This panel attempts to address that scholarly ellipsis. It synthesizes recent research about early American Black print culture with recovery work done on Black loyalists and rebel writers to suggest new ways in which we might understand Blackness and Black-authored texts during this period. Particularly, it offers methodologies through which we might read Black poetry; sentimental fiction; muster rolls; legal documents; transatlantic letters and diaries; white-authored petitions quoting Black writers; and migration passes. In so doing, this panel hopes to provoke a conversation about the whitewashing of the American Revolution while offering other lenses through which we might read diversity into our nation's founding narrative.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The literature on antifascism in Latin America has been frequently affected by a Eurocentric bias that has downplayed the role of local actors while overplaying the role of external factors. As contributors in the establishment of Latin American antifascism as a field of study in its own terms, presenters in this panel pay attention to how different groups, in different contexts, adopted and adapted antifascism, what this term meant to them, and for what purposes they deployed it. Among other issues, they explore the origins and evolution of antifascism in Latin America, its impact in several societies, and the legacies left by "classic" antifascism during the interwar period and World War II for later mobilization and resistance during the Cold War and beyond. While establishing comparisons across countries and time periods, contributors also highlight the networks in which antifascist groups operated or that they helped to create, looking at linkages and interactions across local, national, and transnational dimensions. The panel will be of interest to a broad audience interested in topics such comparative political and ideological history, transnational history, the interwar years and the Cold War, fascism/antifascism, and Latin American and world history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Raphael's frescoes in the Stanza della Segnatura, once the private library of Julius II, manifest a monumental thesis on Renaissance theories of word and image. The rediscovery of the Stanza's collection of deluxe volumes demonstrates that the chamber was animated by a recursive chain of media, from painting to text. Using 3D technologies to reunite the books and the frescoes, this panoramic reconstruction illuminates new dimensions of the Stanza's experience for its early visitors and elucidates the synergistic intellectual web on which the room's design was predicated. It asks: How was the Stanza engaged by its early modern audience? How might the spatial analysis of the pope's literary collection shape our interpretation of the chamber's meaning? How does the relationship of text and image inform our understanding of Renaissance cultures of reading? And how do these investigations inform current urgent discussions about what a library has been and could become?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The contemporary information Renaissance offers powerful possibilities for investigating and representing the culture of the historical Renaissance for which Italy is celebrated around the world. This panel will present two digital projects that fuse traditional modes of study of the period (philology, paleography, art history) with applications of virtual reality, data mining, digital measurement and other tools. Such projects rely on several kinds of hybridity. From cross-disciplinary co-creation to multi-media delivery, they offer new pathways not only for preservation and access regarding archival and rare bibliographic materials, but also hybrid spaces for scholarly collaboration and teaching. Far from alienating or "diluting" traditional resources, digital tools convey the multi-sensory complexity of Renaissance artifacts and spaces, and, at their best, offer immersive, interactive experiences that recapture the scale, detail, cognitive density, and aesthetic specificity of historical resources that are often not accessible to the general public. IDEA: Isabella d'Este Archive features archival document visualization, immersive virtual reality, art history and economic history, and bibliographic data in a set of interlocking and increasingly interactive projects led by a team of specialists from around the world. The Bibliotheca Iulia Instaurata (BI2) brings together book historians, classicists, art historians and interactive media artists to offer a chance to experience selected books from Pope Julius II's private library amid Raphael's frescoes in the Stanza della Segnatura, the intended setting for these precious manuscripts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We have built a digital exploration of the early sixteenth-century private library of Pope Julius II, that we, using the vocabulary of the Renaissance humanists he admired, call the Bibliotheca Iulia instaurata, or the Julian Library renewed. Julius' library was a veritable Renaissance system of knowledge akin to today's hyperlinked information networks, which anticipated the concept of hyperlinks by establishing rich spatial references connecting different parts of the room, frescoes, books and furniture pieces to build a discursive space for knowledge.  Julius II's private library was housed in the Vatican Palace room painted by Raphael between 1509 and 1511 for Julius, now known as the Stanza della Segnatura. The main frescoes depict gatherings of thinkers from Greek antiquity to Julius' own time, from Homer and Plato to Gregory the Great and Raphael himself. The frescoes' themes—Philosophy, Poetry, Theology, and Jurisprudence—pictorially synthesize relationships between these four major disciplines from the period, and Julius collected books in all of them. Almost two hundred of Julius' books survive today, and Raphael's frescoes refer almost recursively to them, their authors, and their diverse fields of study.  The digital environment we have made allows visitors to explore how Julius and Raphael--major figures in the Renaissance-- used pictures, texts, and material artifacts to build a space for learning about their world. Our project aims to make the conceptual system linking these materials accessible and relevant for a contemporary audience and to create a digital version of the Renaissance system of knowledge it manifests. Our approach combines the study of books and paintings that have most often been studied separately, despite the historical fact that early visitors encountered the two together. Furthermore, by using interpretive strategies from art history, material culture, and literature as well as ... [see Secondary URL Description below]</Abstract>

Digital humanities tools are increasingly deployed as research methodologies. Each digital project brings with it its own set of challenges: the binary nature of digital platforms often forces the researcher to present subjective decisions as objective fact, which otherwise may have been moulded with metaphorical language. This workshop will focus on both the institutional and individual level, with an emphasis on digital projects as tools for investigating interdisciplinary concepts of cultural memory.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>In his autobiography, Nelson Mandela admitted, "When I thought of Western democracy and freedom, I thought of the British parliamentary system. While it is reasonable to understand this sentiment as an artifact of cultural imperialism, a left-over of empire, I would contend that it is something more meaningful and complicated. To that end, this paper explores Black British subjects made in and by empire and British traditions in South Africa,  who expressed loyalty and belief in the idea of empire -- embracing arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes' 1898 campaign promise of "equal rights for all civilised men south of the Zambesi" -- and criticized brutality and injustice as failures of empire. African newspaper editors, activists, educators, and other intellectuals interpreted and wrote histories of Britain and the empire, often with focus on the meaning and purpose of the British constitution and parliamentary traditions. They developed legal strategies and arguments based on those readings and took them all the way to the top of the imperial hierarchy: the monarchy, the government, and Parliament. Across considerable distances of multiple colonies, and even the great ocean itself, they organized, petitioned, and lobbied for their communities to demand justice at their district councils, colonial legislatures, and, in the end, the imperial Parliament, casting those who opposed their rights as British subjects, particularly to the franchise, as un-British and enemies of the empire.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper aims to center Black British subjects made in and by empire and British traditions in South Africa -- men who expressed loyalty and belief in the idea of empire and criticized brutality and injustice as failures of empire -- in ascribing histories of South Africa past and present. Black intellectuals, activists, educators, and newspaper editors interpreted and wrote histories of Britain and the empire, often focused on the meaning and purpose of the British constitution and traditions in the empire and the history of colonialism in southern Africa. These works were often developed as campaign literature, in a sense, of larger campaigns and movements in defense of the non-racial franchise of the Cape Colony and more generally their rights as British subjects (as they saw them). But in a larger sense, the articulated an intellectual and historical argument against settler colonialism and dispossession through a lens of British constitutionalism and history. Through these works, these authors developed legal strategies and arguments based on those readings and, in some cases, took their arguments and claims all the way to the top of the imperial hierarchy.  This paper aims to understand not only the ways in which history was employed as a "weapon of the weak" by Black colonial subjects in South Africa but also the significance and relevance of these histories, not merely as artifacts of a particular moment in South African history between colonization and the development of anti-colonialism nationalism, to global histories of Black Britishness and empire.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Sicilian Channel receives global attention as a major migratory route for undocumented people entering Europe clandestinely, a tragic nexus of transnational displacement and desperation. While the plight of massively overloaded and unseaworthy boats of people justifiably receives the media attention, there is a less documented movement that occurs and has occurred for thousands of years: small boats expertly transporting handfuls of people back and forth across the Channel between Tunisia and western Sicily. Material traces of these border crossings share some features with the migrant material culture strewn along the border zone of the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. These include migrants' strategic triangulation of speed, invisibility and survival in deciding what to bring and the tactical triage of gear en route. Further, the political and economic injustices that are catalysts for the movements are comparable, as is the criminalization of the migrants which has done more to endanger than dissuade them. However the exigencies of sea crossing require a distinct set of material culture and technologies of mobility, shedding new light on migrant choices and challenges. This paper explores the material vestiges of these cross-Channel migrations through assemblages identified during fieldwork along the southwest coast of Sicily in Summer 2018.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Arizona Sicily Project is an intensive pedestrian survey in the coastal territory between the Sicilian cities of Marsala and Mazara del Vallo. The project, which began in 2018, focuses on a key feature of this territory: its proximity to North Africa. This zone is the closest point on the island to North Africa, separated from Tunisia by 145 km of water. The project's primary research aim is to document the quantities of North African imports to western Sicily in all periods, in order to reconstruct North African connections to the peoples of this part of the island. Previous work in the region has demonstrated high numbers of North African artifacts in western Sicily in punctuated periods from the Paleolithic onwards, but this project is the first to attempt to document and quantify those contacts over all periods, to understand the deep history of these relations, and how they distinguish the western third of the island from other parts of Sicily. The Arizona Sicily Project is conducted in collaboration with the Soprintendenza dei Beni Culturali di Trapani.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents the results from the first season of the Arizona Sicily Project, an intensive diachronic survey in the coastal territory between the Sicilian cities of Marsala and Mazara del Vallo. The project's primary research aim is to document the quantities of North African imports to western Sicily in all periods, in order to reconstruct North African connections to the peoples of this part of the island. Previous work in the region has demonstrated high numbers of North African artifacts making their way across the Sicilian Channel in punctuated periods from the Paleolithic onwards, but this project is the first to attempt to document and quantify those contacts over all periods, to understand the deep history of these relations, and how they distinguish the western third of the island from other parts of Sicily. The ample evidence of African imports in the Punic and Roman periods seems at first glance to reflect the political circumstances of the time, but given the evidence of imports before and after, the environment (for example the narrowness of the Channel and features of its currents) and shared local communities of practice (fishing grounds) may serve to explain these continuous contacts better than short term top-down political transformations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Western  Sicily  has  followed  a  distinct  cultural  trajectory  from  the  rest  of  the  island, evident archaeologically from the Neolithic through modern times. Driv-ing this region's historical detachment are its close ties to its near neighbors in the Sicilian channel, Tunisia and Pantelleria. The Arizona Sicily Project is an intensive diachronic  archaeological  field  survey  of  southwestern  Sicily  that  seeks  to  chart  long-term settlement and land use in this understudied corner of the island, with the eventual aim of reconstructing the nature and evolution of cross-channel con-nectivity  from  antiquity  to  the  present  day.  This  poster  presents  the  theoretical  background, methods, and results from the survey's first season, in the summer of 2018. The survey zone consists of a 44 km2 strip between the cities of Marsala and Mazara del Vallo. In this season of fieldwork, we focused on the southern 20% of the zone. Our team identified three clusters dating to the Hellenistic and Roman periods, dispersed medieval and early modern artifacts, and even contemporary migrant material culture. More broadly speaking, scant artifacts from antiquity in the coastal zone and more abundant finds further inland are in surprising contrast to artifact distributions a few kilometers north, where our previous work records a distinct decline in artifact numbers inland compared to an intensively used coastal plain.  Archival  research  indicates  that  this  southern  region  of  the  survey,  prior  to  land  reclamation  projects  of  the  early  20th  century,  experienced  fluctuating  marshy conditions. Future work will determine if this pattern continues elsewhere in our survey zone.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 2010, the Applied Anthropology Laboratories, Ball State University, has conducted archaeological, preservation, and interpretation research at St. Clair's Defeat, a relatively unknown 1791 Northwest Indian War battle that was the largest defeat of U.S. military by American Indian forces, in this case an alliance of nine tribes. Using KOCOA military terrain analysis, we focus on how the use of the landscape influenced the outcome of the battle, specifically the tribal battle strategy. Research results have helped in forming a more nuanced interpretation of the battle, one that more fully recognizes and balances the involvement and decisions of both the American Indian tribes and the U.S. military. We use community engaged scholarship methods as we work with the local community of Fort Recovery, Ohio, the Ohio History Connection, and over a dozen U.S. federally recognized tribes to communicate these results to the public in multiple ways. We use our research results and a humanities focus to tell the story within a bigger context of tribes protecting their homelands, the aftermath for tribes resulting in removal and attempted eradication of their culture, and the effects of this battle and the Northwest Indian War on tribes today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>St. Clair's Defeat was a Northwest Indian War battle in 1791, that was a resounding victory for 9 tribes in the American Indian alliance. Ball State University has conducted archaeological and preservation research at the site of St. Clair's Defeat (in modern day Fort Recovery, Ohio) since 2010. Our research focuses on landscape analysis,  both in the context of the location of recovered artifacts and in the role the landscape played in the battle strategies of both the American Indian alliance and U.S. forces. Research results have helped in forming a more nuanced interpretation of the battle, one that more fully recognizes and balances the involvement and decisions of both the American Indian tribes and the U.S. military.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper discusses the intellectual and political trajectory of historian and social theorist Frank Tannenbaum, with an emphasis on the factors that led to his shift from being militant in the anarcho-syndicalist movement associated with the Wobblies to a Cold War liberal.  Central to this paper is my argument that Tannenbaum certainly moved to the right on a number of questions but retained his radical and critical views with regard to questions of incarceration and criminality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Students have been reading classical literature for thousands of years, however, this does not mean they are always able to bridge the gaps of space and time in order to find their value. However, with appropriate context and tools, today's students can and should appreciate these texts for what they are - classic stories that are just as relevant today as when they were composed in the ancient world. Our panel will center around veteran issues, many of which have remained essentially the same for thousands of years. For the previous six years, we have been working on three National Endowment for the Humanities grants that address veteran issues. Our approach is based on showing the continuity of veteran experience as depicted in ancient texts. In particular, we focus on ancient tragedy, following the work of psychiatrist Jonathan Shay who has argued that Athenian tragedy was a form of communal therapy for, of, and by veterans. In two Dialogues on the Experience of War grants, and one K-12 Summer Institute grant, we have led students, our college faculty colleagues, and teachers through sources, methods, and the academic rationale for our approach. We have sought to facilitate dialogue between veterans, but also have found great benefit by reaching out to veteran dependents, and to bringing civilians into dialogue with veterans. In addition to showing the continuity of experiences of war, we have had success in creating awareness of veteran issues. All of our work has emphasized the practical application of the Classics and the humanities and arts in general to effect positive personal change and wider community understanding of highly relevant issues that have remained constant throughout history. This panel will include papers from some of our partners in our grant work, an overview of our approach, and some new ideas in the classics we have applied to our work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper addresses the details, sources, and some original ideas that we have developed in the course of our grant work. We expand upon the theories of Aristotle and Shay, incorporating the work of other scholars, and adding new observations and arguments. In short, we consider the important similarities between tragic festivals and the Eleusinian Mysteries, Hippocratic medicine, and the Ascelipius cult. There is overlapping or shared vocabulary in some instances  (Jouanna and van der. Eijk), similar practices, and other remarkable parallels that reveal a great deal about Greek thought and practices regarding the healing of the psyche, as well as their beliefs about the connection between the mind and body. For example, we discuss Karlisa Hartigan's claim that there was a dramatic pageant performed for patients as part of the ritual enacted at the ancient Asclepieia that assists in the healing process "to prepare the patients to receive the dreams sent by the god" (29). Hartigan's idea, coupled with the fact that Ascelpian sanctuaries are located adjacent to theaters across the Greek world, suggests that the Greeks thought of both theaters and these sanctuaries as places of healing, and that performance was a crucial aspect shared by both. We also address the use of wine as a "medicine" (Jouanna and van der. Eijk), performance at Eleusis, and the strong possibility of the use of psychedelics among the Greeks (Wasson et al.; Muraresku); we argue, in light of recent medical research, that the use of psychedelics was serving as a treatment for mental health issues. Most importantly, we describe how many Greek medical and ritual practices are very well supported by modern psychological and medical research on the treatment of trauma.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recently, we have seen the effects of conflict in the war between Ukraine and Russia, as millions have fled the country or have been internally displaced. Simultaneously, thousands of soldiers from foreign countries have streamed into Ukraine, some of whom are expressly termed by the media as ‘mercenaries.' In the late Classical and Hellenistic Periods, thousands of these misthophoroi traversed the Mediterranean to fight for tyrants, kings, and empires (Garland 2014). This presentation will analyze how the experiences of these soldiers, especially their socio-political integration after warfare, is constructed in two chronological/geographical periods/locations, namely 4th-century Sicily and Athens (Chaniotis 2005). This (possible) acceptance into new communities will be evaluated briefly through various source materials. In literature, historiographical accounts often provide important details, while New Comedy also shows the integration of soldiers into the polis (although the comic nature of the text requires careful consideration of their portrayal). Especially in Athens, inscriptions detail administrative efforts to accept or to reject garrisons and individual soldiers, who occasionally are honored for their service to the community (Oliver 2000). In Sicily, archaeological evidence, in changes to urban layouts and material finds left behind by mercenaries, demonstrates how large-scale migrations of soldiers radically transformed the landscape (Harris 2020). Finally, coinage from both locations shows the economic effect of this martial mobility on both soldier and city. By discussing several specific artifacts and passages, this presentation will offer ways in which to reconstruct the experience of soldiers, while also identifying inherent biases and lacunae (Meineck and Konstan 2014). The goal will be to shed light on this important group of migrants who often fall through the cracks of history by showing them not as mindless hordes but as individuals with thei</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a brief presentation followed by a facilitated Q&amp;amp;A, I discuss the role of Washington University's NEH Next Generation PhD Planning Grant process in successfully engaging faculty to work together with administrators and student representatives on questions of career development for humanities PhDs. I argue that the grant provided an external impetus for change and provided (often overworked) faculty with at least minimal compensation and a more desirable status as "grant participants" instead of a more nebulous request for committee or institutional "service." The grant's position in the Center for the Humanities and its faculty PI also helped our faculty conceptualize graduate career development as a series of faculty-driven initiatives rather than a top-down administrative imperative.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Akolet (Austronesian, Papua New Guinea) has personal pronouns and articles that distinguish gender and marital status, e.g., ‘unmarried 3sg masculine' versus ‘married 3sg masculine'. While singular pronouns mark both gender and marital status, plural pronouns mark gender only for married people. Given that the choice of pronoun depends on social status and societal role, these pronouns and articles denote how a person contributes to the life of a community, rather than simply indicating marital status. This analysis suggests that some aspects of linguistic structure cannot be understood outside the cultural context of language use.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Exploring the implications of a distinction Aristotle draws between bios (politically qualified life) and zoe (natural life), Giorgio Agamben develops the notion of bare life, life stripped of political protections. To exemplify the precarity of bare life, Agamben turns not to the ubiquitous figure of the ancient slave but to homo sacer, an obscure figure of Roman law. This despite the fact that the passage in the Politics where Aristotle distinguishes bios from zoe continues with a discussion of natural slavery. Agamben returns to that passage and its treatment of slavery in the final volume of his Homo Sacer project, The Use of Bodies (2016). There, however, rather than deepening his genealogy of bare life, he elaborates "a theory of use." He stipulates messianic dimensions for this theory. Quoting 1 Cor 7:21, Agamben contends, "The messianic call…consists first of all in the capacity to ‘use' the factical condition in which each one finds himself." Agamben speculates that "the use of the body" in slavery "evoke[s] the paradigm of a human activity that is reducible neither to labor, nor to production, nor to praxis." He imagines an originary "community of life" between master and slave, an elision of the brute force fundamental to despotic relationships. Following Agamben's philological lead, I investigate Paul's use of chresis and cognates in passages involving either slaves or invocations of slavery and freedom Agamben's take on "use" is belied by standard Greek idioms. Moreover, the conception of slavery in terms of mutual use obscures the precarity inherent in the lives of enslaved.

		<Abstract>This paper traces important shifts in theories and ideologies about body and soul, and the extent to which these shifts have affected Western intellectual history, focusing particularly on philosophy and the human sciences. Secondarily, I also consider the ways in which these shifts affected intimate aspects of everyday life in the West. In the concluding section, I argue that, historically, social struggles for the control of meanings related to body and soul have been important – precisely because these struggles have not been about mere meanings detached from life, but about aspects of life itself. Understanding the effects that these kinds of ideas and beliefs have historically had is critical in an age such as ours, which is witnessing the rise of various forms of religious fundamentalism and the return of religious war. This project is supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (# AQ-234985).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance carried important and enduring changes in the way Westerners conceived the body and the soul, shifts in perspective that initially transformed key aspects of (Renaissance) art, including music, as well as literature and philosophy. Renewed interest in anatomy, in particular, forced Renaissance artist and thinkers to reconfigure their ideas of the body and its relationship to the soul. Anatomists searched for the soul by dissecting cadavers; artist dissected the body to better convey the human spirit; and writers dissected the soul through their work; and they thus set in motion paradigmatic upheavals that eventually resulted in changes in the ways Westerners understood the idea of the human, both theoretically as well as at the level of collective beliefs. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the body/soul rhetoric was recast during the Renaissance; how these changes affected the arts and literature of the period, and show that changes in beliefs and preoccupations pertaining to the body and the soul powerfully contribute to shaping cultural products (e.g., artistic and literary) as well as important aspects of everyday life. This presentation is partly sponsored by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (# AQ-234985).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 2005 and 2014, the Central Lydia Archaeological Survey (CLAS) worked to record accurately the locations of sites of cultural activity in the Marmara Lake Basin of the Gediz Valley, western Turkey, recovering diachronic remains spanning the Paleolithic to the recent past. Since 2014, the Kaymakçi Archaeological Project (KAP) has conducted excavations and related research at a second-millennium BCE citadel in the same area, with long-term plans to continue fieldwork and publication activities. Both projects have relied on digital data-management practices from their inception, involving relational databases, digital image collections, geodatabases, and – now for KAP – volumetric data collection, even if particular data formats and organizational schemes have evolved over the years.  As analyses of CLAS materials wind down and KAP data collection and analysis continue, project directors aim to publish data online to make "near complete" data available to the public and "ongoing" data available to researchers for continuing analyses. Which data archives are most sustainable? Which allow for dynamic data interaction, including via geospatial portals? And which are the most user-friendly, to ensure fluid and easy data access? Finally, what specific data cleaning or other preparatory activities are advisable to ensure data compatibility with universal standards? The project directors recognize that these and other basic questions need answers before taking next steps and are looking for the best solutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Ancient Graffiti Project (AGP) has been designed to provide a scholarly yet user- friendly resource for the study of handwritten wall-inscriptions. From prayers to quotations of poetry, from grocery lists to greetings from friends, people wrote a variety of messages on the walls of the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. These texts are as individualized as people who wrote them and are heterogeneous in content, format, handwriting, and expression. AGP offers explanatory material, interactive filters, and links to further information to aid the scholar in evaluating these inscriptions, their locations, and their characteristics.  For the Visible Words Conference, we will focus our discussion on the choices we have made for presenting text along with archaeological context, since ancient graffiti are usually found in their original location and Herculaneum and Pompeii provide a rich archaeological context. We will also discuss challenges involved in illustrating difficult to read, often fragmentary inscriptions. Ancient graffiti are rarely ever illustrated. They are small and often shallowly incised and therefore difficult to capture in a photograph. Yet the appearance and paleography of these personal inscriptions is illuminating. Some messages are written in all capital letters, others in cursive lettering. Many graffiti are written in a steady hand; others were clearly composed by someone who was less familiar with writing. Finally, we look forward to fruitful discussions about EpiDoc.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars of American periodicals in the modernist era often find themselves beset with a variety of categorizations: pulp and slick, big and little, commercial and avant-garde. Such characterizations derive from longstanding critical characterizations that have become ossified over time. Nevertheless, one of the greatest remaining unknowns in the history of American periodical culture is also among the most crucial pieces of information about magazine popularity, reach, and influence: circulation. This talk serves to introduce a new Digital Humanities project titled Circulating American Magazines, a resource that seeks to make publicly available for the first time detailed circulation information about American magazines from the 1860s through the 1970s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeological excavations in the heart of Mexico City can help understand how indigenous people created and transformed both public and private spaces in the city before and after the Spanish conquest of 1521.  Scholars have remarked that historical narratives left by Spanish colonizers describe Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire, as a feature of the landscape rather than a feat of indigenous engineering.  Scholarship on architecture and urban change after the conquest has in turn focused extensively on the actions of colonizers in destroying the previous city and building new, more European buildings.  Archaeological data from Mexico City show that many pre-conquest engineering techniques were used to build the colonial city, allowing us to see the role of indigenous engineering, architecture, and technology in building the capital of New Spain.  Archaeological data also show that indigenous builders created the earliest houses for Spanish colonizers with their traditional, indigenous aesthetics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars have asked how empires solidify power when colonizers, the agents of empire-building, often have diverse goals and backgrounds and their actions do not necessarily support the goals of the empire. Two answers to this question have received attention: that empires promote ideologies that support cohesion among colonizers, and that coercion and violence can promote the expansion of empires. I propose a third answer, in which colonizers create varied material forms that may challenge the goals of empire, but later appeal to the king for regulation and control over the material world. To illustrate this case, I use the example of coins among Spanish colonizers in Mexico City. Colonizers invented and used a variety of coins, in part by diluting gold into different alloys to make up for the scarcity of gold that they found in the colonies. Thus, they challenged imperial authority by creating new ways of measuring value and wealth (in this case, by creating more wealth with diluted gold). But when they found that their new coins created problems of conversion and exchange, they appealed to the crown requesting regulations over the minting, value, and use of different coins, thereby strengthening imperial authority.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the prevailing truisms of globalization is that we live in an era of pandemic threats, of rapid travel and dangerous proximity that facilitate the adaptation, spread, and (re)emergence of infectious diseases, and that consequently we need robust systems of disease surveillance to protect public health and even species life.  As international news outlets and supranational health organizations such as WHO repeatedly warn us, we are one viral mutation away from the end of the world as we know it.  If Foucault's chapter on "Panopticism" opened with a description of the plague-stricken town, in the new millennium, the most potent and haunting icon of disease is not the afflicted city or the epidemic nation but the pandemic planet.  In recent years, however, a range of critics have flipped the causal chain of this story to emphasize the ways the biosecurity state underlies and produces this contemporary imagining of global contagion.  My paper will discuss several of these arguments and their implications for the thinking of power: science historian Nicholas King's "emerging diseases worldview," sociologist Melinda Cooper's "preemption," and philosopher Brian Massumi's "ontopower."  Infectious disease discourse in the broad sense, then, encompassing not just state rhetoric but that of health organizations and the media as much as literary and scholarly writing, offers a key site for reexamining and extending models of biopower in our time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Priscilla Ward has suggested that, in the post-HIV world, a set of tropes have emerged in both scientific and cultural accounts of infectious diseases, constituting what she calls an "outbreak narrative."  One common feature of this narrative is a "geography of disease" in which "timeless, brooding Africa or Asia" serves as "the birthplace of humanity, civilization, and deadly microbes."  While Ward's archive is largely western, this paper examines a work of outbreak narrative from one Asian site at the height of an epidemic -- the lowbrow Hong Kong film CITY OF SARS.  Produced and released in the summer of 2003, while SARS was still spreading throughout the world and the WHO travel advisory on Hong Kong had not yet been lifted, this movie is decidedly local in its address.  Drawing on a host of locally well-known television actors and entertainment personalities (rather than the handful of arthouse movie stars who have international renown) and split into three independent storylines about how ordinary people deal with the outbreak, the film mobilizes several popular genres familiar to local viewers: the hospital drama, the sentimental adolescent romance, and farce.  The last segment especially offers an innovative form of what I call epidemic camp.  On the local level, the movie's generic storylines can be read as providing a sense of normality and continuity, even banality, amid a time of crisis for the city.  On the global level, they can be invoked to disrupt the logic of contemporary western outbreak narratives, particularly what I have called pandemic orientalism elsewhere.  Critical attention to self-representations at those epidemic sites can generate a powerful counterdiscourse to the ongoing rhetoric of global health security in our time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In post-millennial Chinese literature, we find a recurrent and acute concern with the body in capital—a genre I will call biocapitalist fiction.  This preoccupation with China's new biopolitical regimes cuts across national and linguistic boundaries, uniting mainland and diasporic as well as Sinophone and Anglophone writers.  Against the utopian rhetoric of Chinese capitalism as post-socialist freedom, contemporary writers insistently spotlight authoritarian capital's predation on the body as a vehicle for state profit.  Diasporic authors such as Yan Geling, Yiyun Li, and Ma Jian, for instance, have carried forward the themes of biocapitalist cannibalism and reproductive control in earlier mainland works by Mo Yan and Wang Shuo, all of them sharing a dystopic hyperrealism of the present.  More rarely tackled yet equally provocative is the fate of future Chinese bodies.  My paper will examine two recent works that address this issue: Chan Koonchung's The Fat Years and Xiaolu Guo's UFO in Her Eyes.  Published in 2009, the former in Chinese and the latter in English, both novels forecast near-future Chinas, the first of global economic dominance and the second of rapid rural commercialization.  In contrast to other biocapitalist fictions, however, Chan's and Guo's texts raise the question: what kind of political order comes into being and what becomes of embodied life itself when the target of state biopower is no longer an isolated subject or specific social identity—such as the political dissident, the star athlete, the male baby, or the reproductive mother—but simply the generic citizen, every citizen?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The past decade has marked the emergence and spread of biocapital scholarship—analyses of biopower in relation to capitalism.  This theoretical approach has been cross-disciplinary but particularly alive in the social sciences, as anthropologists and sociologists examine the power relations and capitalist dynamics of such areas as the life sciences (Franklin and Lock), biomedicine (Rose), genomics (Sunder Rajan), biotechnology (Ong and Chen), and state governance (Greenhalgh), among others.  So, while the term biopower originated with Foucault in reference to Western contexts, it is now deployed as a broader research method by many social scientists in probing present capitalist milieus.  In particular, many scholars focus on Asia as a major force in current technologies and sciences of life—in effect, as the site where much of our contemporary understanding of life's boundaries get defined.  This paper traces the most prominent scholarship on biocapitalism in recent years.  In addition, it proposes the relevance and fruitfulness of biocapital as a theoretical framework for reading contemporary Asian fiction, with special attention to post-Tiananmen Chinese and Chinese diaspora fiction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I use Xiaolu Guo's novel UFO IN HER EYES not only as a case study for biocapitalist fictions but also as a conceptual entry point into the broader question of how Anglophone texts can be read alongside Sinophone ones and how they together constitute one strand of contemporary Chinese literature.  At the most basic level, this analysis opposes models of linguistic or national essentialism.  To some extent, my analysis still relies on writers' shared ethnic identity for the category of "Chinese" literature, but recent scholarship on comparative ethnicity within a transnational framework should help complicate this seemingly straightforward reading.  Ultimately, I am interested in how Chinese biocapitalist fictions represent one of the most prominent specimens of the totalitarian dystopia genre in world literature today, and by extension, how this genre actively shapes global discourses on Chinese power.  What counts as "Chinese literature," then, is not simply the ethnic identity of the author or the thematic content of the narrative, but also this discursive function of the text within a contemporary global cultural economy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper tells the story of a man named Bartholomew Fenton (the subject of my next book) and explores the relationships between militia service, racial violence, and republican manhood during the American Revolution. In 1770, Fenton was a convict servant in Virginia, exiled from London for the crime of petty theft. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, Fenton had made his way to the contested territory of Kentucky. He mustered in the frontier militia during the war, fighting in the intense violence of 1777 and participating in the emergence of a discourse of  "Indian hating" that would shape the intensity of western warfare. Fenton's service earned him a land claim in Kentucky. He established himself as a freeholder in the new American republic and eventually purchased two female slaves. In 1792, Fenton was arrested for brutally beating one of these slave women to death. After he was arrested and tried, a jury acquitted him of all charges. Through Fenton's story, we witness an ordinary man's passage from colonial servant to republican citizen and gain intimate perspective on the role that racialized violence played in this transformation. Once a dependent servant with a criminal past, Fenton was reborn in frontier war as a man of status and privilege in a republic that shrouded its fetish for racial difference with the language of human equality. Crucial to that rebirth was a shifting understanding of what constituted legitimate violence and who possessed the right to wield it. In the context of the revolution, Fenton acquired a new and special destiny as a white male citizen of the American republic, an identity that was rooted in landed status, forged in the cauldron of Indian war, and secured in violent mastery over slave property.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Effective altruists are those who strive toward, and believe they ought to be, doing the most good they can (Singer 2016: vii). Toward this end, they apply "evidence and reason to working out the most effective ways to improve the world" (Singer 2016: 4-5); (MacAskill 2015: 32).  Actual effective altruists are also fallible and, without exception, would fail to do the most good they can in some situations. This fact raises a central question about how to understand effective altruism. How should one's future failures at doing the most good possible affect the current choices one makes as an effective altruist (EA)? To put the question a different way, what is the relationship between an EA's future free choices and her present obligations as an EA? This question has not yet received any attention in the effective altruism literature, which is an unfortunate oversight since every EA will face this issue due to typical human akrasia.  It is also important to answer this question because how we do so will determine how demanding effective altruism can be. Answering this question is also necessary to guide the practical choices EAs ought to make. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, I explore the implications of the different viable answers to this question for effective altruism. Interestingly, prominent EAs seem disposed to endorse the most popular answer (i.e. actualism), which entails that effective altruism is much less demanding than some of its critics believe.  Yet, there are good reasons to believe that actualism is false. Rejecting actualism, however, undermines common responses EAs give to demandingness objections. Second, I provide my own positive answer to this question and then review the important implications of this view for effective altruism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although the architecture of Spanish and Portuguese America today comprises one of the most flourishing subjects in the art-historical discipline the same cannot be said for that of the French Atlantic Empire, which astonishingly--except for regional scholarship on Quebec and a handful of buildings in Louisiana--does not exist as a field. This talk will provide a brief overview of the architectural heritage of the French Atlantic Empire (including the rich collection of plans and drawings in the archives in Aix-en-Provence and elsewhere) and will contextualize French America within the history of Latin American architecture, examining how differing ideologies and utopianisms among the French and Iberian empires led to strikingly contrasting architectural cultures despite shared histories of conquest, settlement, conversion, and forced labour. This paper will encompass North America, the French Antilles, French Guyana, and also Senegal.</Abstract>

It is also important to answer this question because how we do so will determine how demanding effective altruism can be. Answering this question is also necessary to guide the practical choices EAs ought to make. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, I explore the implications of the different viable answers to this question for effective altruism. Interestingly, prominent EAs seem disposed to endorse the most popular answer (i.e. actualism), which entails that effective altruism is much less demanding than some of its critics believe.  Yet, there are good reasons to believe that actualism is false. Rejecting actualism, however, undermines common responses EAs give to demandingness objections. Second, I provide my own positive answer to this question and then review the important implications of this view for effective altruism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The actualism/possibilism debate in ethics concerns the relationship between an agent's free actions and her moral obligations. The actualist affirms, while the possibilist denies, that facts about what agents would freely do in certain circumstances partly determines that agent's moral obligations. This paper assesses the plausibility of actualism and possibilism in light of desiderata about accounts of blameworthiness. This paper first argues that actualism cannot straightforwardly accommodate certain very plausible desiderata before offering a few independent solutions on behalf of the actualist. This paper then argues that, contrary to initial appearances, possibilism is subject to its own comparably troubling blameworthiness problem.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Grupo Ruptura (Rupture Group), the abstract and Concrete art group established in São Paulo in 1952, is commonly characterized by its dismissal of all but the most stringent practice of geometric abstraction. This paper asserts that the crux of the group's approach entailed the conception of art as a form of knowledge and social relation more so than a claim to stylistic unity or hard-and-fast antagonism to figuration. The group's leader, artist and critic Waldemar Cordeiro, was, along with critic Mário Pedrosa, one of abstraction's most significant interpreters in Brazil in the decade following World War II. I analyze the parallels Cordeiro constructed between non-representational abstraction and day-to-day, material reality and his criticisms of the private, exclusionary nature of the new modern art institutions in Brazil in relationship to his engagement with the discourses of Marxism and formalist art theory. Challenging an account of the history of Brazilian abstraction that centers the international contact fostered by the first São Paulo Bienal (1951) and the influence of Max Bill, I explore Cordeiro and his contemporaries' manifold immersion in the history and theory of modernism and the heterodox early abstract practice of Cordeiro and fellow Grupo Ruptura members, including Geraldo de Barros.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"There is no reason why my pre-1959 work should be taken seriously," Hélio Oiticica stated in 1972, dismissing the hundreds of works he produced in the mid- to late 1950s as an unoriginal working through of other artists' ideas-"infinitesimated mondrianstructure." Oiticica's thinking about European modernism and the art and ideas of Paul Klee, Kazimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian, in particular, was indeed paramount in his production of these years, as he expressed in a gouache on cardboard work from 1958 he retrospectively titled MALEKLEDRIAN in Four Positions (MALEKLEDRIAN em 4 posições). Scholars have persuasively interpreted Malevich and Mondrian as key interlocutors for Oiticica in his abandonment of painting and pictorial space in favor of three-dimensional and social space, but Klee's significant role has gone largely unanalyzed. Klee was among the first modern artists whose work Oiticica viewed in significant quantities in person, at the National Gallery of Art and possibly the Klee Room at the Phillips Collection when his family lived in Washington, D.C., between 1947 and 1949, and at the remarkable historical displays at the second Bienal de São Paulo in 1953-54. He also acquired numerous Klee monographs during the 1950s. Moreover, Klee's stylistic heterodoxy was central to the expanded conception of modernism put forward by critic Mário Pedrosa, whose writings and ideas were foundational to Oiticica's own. As I will argue, Oiticica's interest in Klee - documented in sketches, writings, and works over the course of the 1950s - encompassed more than formal concerns and extended to the foundations of Oiticica's conception of art making as an ethical, nonlinear practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the early 1960s, Pape exhibited the two works, both unbound books, in tandem in the and she and critics discussed the works as interconnected projects. One was Book of Creation (1959-60), widely considered a landmark work in postwar art history, now held in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and as an embodiment of the participatory principles of Neo-Concretism - the movement that has received more attention than any other of Brazil's contributions to contemporary art. The other is the lesser known Poemas-Xilogravuras (Poems-Woodcuts) (1960), composed of fourteen sheets of cardboard printed with poems and woodcuts on cardboard. And indeed Poemas-Xilogravuras soon receded into the background of Pape's representation of her production and the work has been little studied by historians. Placing the works back into relation to one another, I argue, reinforces an original and radical component of Book of Creation, namely the withholding of language. The juxtaposition of the two projects allows us to perceive the different representational and expressive labor Pape assigns to language, touch, and vision in the description of nature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Most Christians in late antiquity understood imperially sanctioned violence against the earliest Christians as the unjustified persecution of martyrs by an empire that was at odds with God.   Nevertheless, Christians in positions of power after the rise of the emperor Constantine often explained imperially sanctioned violence against their religious opponents as the justified suppression of heresy, a narrative that complicated the position of Christians who rejected imperial orthodoxy, such as those who denounced the legitimacy of the Council of Chalcedon after 451.  One consequence of this post-Constantinian challenge is that narratives of violence pervade the fifth- and sixth-century anti-Chalcedonian writings of John Rufus, Zachariah Rhetor, Philoxenos of Mabbug, Severus of Antioch, and John of Ephesus, as these authors depict their heroes as the most recent martyrs in a long line of suffering saints who persevered in Christian truth in the face of unjust imperial persecution.  The fact, though, that these authors retained a narrative of their community as God's suffering saints even when they had imperial support under the emperor Anastasius (r. 491-518), highlighting in those years their heroes' self-imposed struggles from ascetic hardships more than physical injuries from imperial violence, demonstrates that their stories of suffering were carefully crafted for rhetorical effect in each new context.  Faced with a variety of threats to their followers' allegiance over the decades, ranging from bloody physical violence to the attractive temptations of bribery, these sixth-century leaders persistently represented anti-Chalcedonian Christians as suffering saints in the lineage of the early martyrs in the hope of defending their doctrinal legitimacy regardless of who currently held sway in the imperial capital, and of thus reducing the rate of apostasy from their churches.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the famous Pullo and Vorenus episode from Caesar's Gallic Wars 5.44, we gain insight into the motivation of the individual soldier in Caesar's army—at least insofar as Caesar himself hopes to depict it. On the one hand, Pullo and Vorenus are interested in honor and standing among their fellow soldiers; on the other hand, they certainly have an interest in the many tangible and material awards that the primus pilus may accrue. This paper will focus on the latter as a starting point to understand how Caesar was able to motivate his army throughout the Gallic Wars and beyond, considering, too, the critical role that Caesar's veterans played in the Roman Revolution. Thus, while Caesar's account of military virtus is grounded in ancient Roman values and the warrior ethos, as this paper will argue (cf. esp. Goldsworthy), the reality was far different. As J. E. Landon has argued, "the real events [of war] are filtered through the literary, intellectual, and cultural assumptions of the author" (273). The Pullo and Vorenus episode, then, suits Caesar's rhetorical aims perfectly: the individual Roman soldier is intrinsically motivated to perform bravely on the battlefield and his rivalry only extends so far, as both men ultimately help one another escape the enemy. This narrative framework gives Caesar the moral high ground he desires, as individual ambition and military excellence is motivated by honor first and is ultimately channeled towards non-self-interested ends. But the episode may be read in a far richer context, considering the plunder, land, donatives, and public glory that would accrue for a soldier sharing in Caesar's individual glory. This paper, then, will consider Pullo and Vorenus' actions in that fuller context, as a means of understanding their motivations more fully, and in a manner that reaches beyond the narrow rhetorical aims of Caesar's own narrative.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper and this panel are envisioned with an audience primarily of New Mexicans and Texans; our papers would be appropriate for any community group or club interested in regional history and literature. The "forgotten frontera" explored is that borderland between eastern New Mexico and western Texas, the isolated llano, the southern Great Plains. In 1786, peace treaties between Span and the Comanches led to a period of peace and trade. For the next 90 years, New Mexican pioneers ventured further east onto the plains to hunt bison, trade with the Comanches, and herd sheep. By the time this period came to an end in the 1870s and 80s, New Mexican sheepmen had established ranchos and small settlements in the Texas panhandle and beyond. This period is paid little attention in New Mexican histories more focused on the Rio Grande valley and other more populated areas of the territory. More troubling, the history is largely omitted and whitewashed in Texas because it implicates Texas cattlemen in a violent territorial takeover. This project is thus engaged in analyzing two ethnographic texts, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca's We Fed Them Cactus (1954) and Samuel Leo Gonzales' The Days of Old (1993). Multivalent and genre crossing, these books include rich oral tradition that recount pioneer days, lifeways, and the end of the period with the coming of the Texans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Books were an important conduit for scientific ideas in the early modern period. A significant feature of many of these books were illustrations depicting the specimens, instruments, and experiments discussed in the text. These images helped circulate knowledge between individual natural philosophers and newly formed intellectual networks forming in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Printed images were also sites of negotiation as book illustrations required the specialized skill of an artist or artisan to engrave, etch, or carve the block or plate. Thus, these images are fruitful sites to study the relationship between author and image-maker.This paper explored the role of images in early modern scientific books, focusing on texts published by the early Académie royale des sciences in Paris. Founded in 1666, the French Academy was one of the first scientific societies in Europe, receiving patronage from King Louis XIV. This generous funding was reflected in their earliest publications which were large, sumptuous, and heavily illustrated. Some of these images were celebrated for their artistic skill as well as scientific accuracy. This paper will examine how these images were negotiated between scientist and artist, as well as their role in disseminating knowledge created by the young Academy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the seventeenth century new organizations—scientific societies—were created for the collective pursuit of natural philosophy. These centralized institutions became nodes for natural philosophical correspondence within the epistolary networks of the Republic of Letters. For example, Fellow of the Royal Society Henry Oldenburg (1619-1677) wrote and collected thousands of letters during his tenure as the Secretary, many of which were published in the Philosophical Transactions journal. Yet, in addition to textual accounts of experiments, observations, and discoveries, these letters also frequently contained images. From marginalia drawings to engravings amended on separate sheets, visual material was a prominent part of scientific correspondence. What role did images play in the epistolary networks of early scientific societies? How were these ‘visual letters' treated upon their receipt? And how did societal record keeping and copying practices impact the preservation and circulation of these images? Drawn from material in the Royal Society's archives, this paper examines the function of visual letters within natural philosophical correspondence networks in the early modern period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How were new ideas about the natural world created and circulated in the global early modern world? And who claimed authority over that knowledge? One of the primary formats was through images. Analyzing how images circulated—both physically and through reproduction—is key to understanding both how new knowledge was created and how rival empires competed to control it. At the same time as European empires were expanding, burgeoning scientific institutions, such as the Royal Society of London, mobilized global networks of philosophers to claim precedence and establish themselves, and their Crown, as the arbiters of new knowledge. Much scholarship analyzes the textual records of the Royal Society, but images are often considered tangential or secondary in the circulation and production of colonial knowledge. This paper examined how images were, instead, fundamental to the circulation and proliferation of new ideas that simultaneously entwined scientific and state interests.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will examine the diverse functions of images within a foundational scientific society in France – the Académie royale des sciences in Paris. During the Academy's formative period, from its inauguration in 1666 to the death of King Louis XIV in 1715, the Academy produced a wealth of images in the form of drawings, prints, medallions, and paintings, and was subject to widespread visual representation. Like Accademia dei Lincei in Italy or the Royal Society of London, the Academy was pivotal in the development of early modern natural philosophy as one of the first and best-funded scientific institutions in Europe.  In this paper I explore how various images and objects functioned in the service of knowledge production and as a means of broadcasting monarchical power. For example, the Academy created dozens of drawings during the course of their experiments, dissections, and discoveries, and these drawings, were then used as the basis of scientific debates. These drawings functioned epistemically as critical tools in the Academy's work creating new ideas and theories. In contrast, the many medals and jeton coins created by and for the Academy commemorated significant achievements by the Academy as circulated them as significant moments in the reign of Louis XIV. In this way, these coins and medals functioned politically, both to elevate the status of the Academy and to link it to the status of the crown. Using a series of case-studies across different media, this paper will analyze the diverse functions images and image-making practices served both within the internal operations of the Academy, and outwards to the wider public of government officials and international network of natural philosophers. Ultimately, I argue that a diverse array of visual practices and materials were indispensable to the Academy's projects, and simultaneously provide tangible evidence of the French State's scientific ambitions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How was natural knowledge communicated and circulated by scientific societies in the early modern period? One method was through engraved images included in the printed works of these new institutions. An important part of printed books, journals, and treatises, engraved images were a critical component of transmitting knowledge from the private collaborative spaces of halls and meeting rooms to wider audiences. In these publication formats, engraved images helped circulate knowledge between individual natural philosophers and newly formed intellectual networks forming in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the same time, printed images were also sites of negotiation, as they required the specialized skill of an artist or artisan to engrave, etch, or carve the block or plate. Thus, these images are fruitful sites to study the relationship between author and image-maker. This paper discussed the role of engraved images within early modern scientific societies. Focusing on the Royal Society of London and the Académie royale des science in Paris, this paper will explore how the creation of printed images to accompany these institutions' scientific texts was a complex process negotiated by multiple stakeholders. The process of illustrating their written texts required early members of both societies to work with skilled engravers, such as William Faithhorne and Sébastien Leclerc, to create images for their published works. These relationships, varyingly collaborative and antagonistic, directly affected the success of the images and the larger scientific project. Thus, to understand the diverse function of these images within early modern print culture, we must incorporate the viewpoints and practices of both society members and the skilled artists who created them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The southern plains of West Texas has a rich Mexican cultural history that is also a history of indigeneity, mestizaje, and colonialism.  The 19th century American cartographic archive of the region maps the development of settler culture while also recording remnants of Mexican and indigenous presence and subsequent removal. This presentation, as part of the West Texas A&amp;amp;M University "Forgotten Frontera" NEH-funded project, uses the region's map archive to create a toponymic storytelling of the Mexican cultural and historical record of Llano Estacado. The spatial reconstructions of place names and geography in maps recount historical and cultural authority. Toponyms also serve as generalizing metaphors that erase narrative and fail to pronounce plot lines, conflict, stories, and histories. Nevertheless, a critical reading of maps can reveal unseen trail ways, riverbeds, and plaza structures that help to reconstruct new stories of the southern plains. A new narrative cartography of the Mexican cultural history of the region resists White Supremacist settler colonialism through the recovery of stories, histories, and cultures with lasting legacies of colonial resistance, agricultural ingenuity, and an ecology of preservation and care.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This roundtable considers the vexing issue of homelessness and urban poverty in Los Angeles and the Bronx. It foregrounds homelessness as a key crisis exacerbated by these uncertain times that far from being exceptional reveals a continuity with post WWII policies and trends. The panel explores two under-examined causes of homelessness, war and the antipathy of people who identify as queer, and how these forces ghettoized refugees, asylum seekers, and people who identify as queer in homeless districts nationwide such as Skid Row, Los Angeles and select communities in the Bronx.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper investigates the ways in which digitally enhanced Sinophone performance mobilizes classicist aesthetics and poetics to connect local literary topoi to a broader shared sense of "Chineseness" among audience members. Since the early 2000s, the popularity of Zhang Yimou's "Impressions Series" has led to the growth of large-scale tourist performances at destinations in the PRC such as West Lake in Hangzhou, Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province, and Dunhuang in Gansu Province—locations that also feature prominently in classical poetry, Buddhist religious practice, and the Chinese national imaginary. These elaborate shows simultaneously capitalize on the latest advancements in spectacular performance technologies and engage more deeply with the Chinese literary tradition, often literalizing well-known poetic images or even literally overlaying the stage with projected Chinese characters. Examination of these live performances therefore enables us to reconsider the relationship between classicism and cutting-edge technology, materiality and immateriality, topos and "text" in the digital age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper investigates the ways in which digitally enhanced tourist performance in the PRC mobilize classicist aesthetics and poetics to connect classical literary topoi to a broader shared sense of Chinese culture among audience members. Since the early 2000s, the popularity of Zhang Yimou's "Impressions Series" has led to the growth of large-scale performances at destinations such as West Lake in Hangzhou, Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province, and Dunhuang in Gansu Province—locations that also feature prominently in classical poetry, Buddhist religious practice, and the Chinese national imaginary. These elaborate shows capitalize on the latest advancements in spectacular performance technologies and engage with the Chinese literary tradition, often literalizing well-known poetic images and literally overlaying the stage with Chinese characters, landscape paintings, and photographic images. Digital technologies transform live performance into a projection surface, yet in doing so also project a form of classicism that seems only skin deep. Building on the theoretical work of media studies scholars Giuliana Bruno, Audrey Yue, and others, this paper explores the "surface tensions" inherent in these works. It argues that while critiques of the superficiality of large-scale performance remain valid, that very superficiality (as well as its rootedness in digital technologies) is also instrumental in enabling classicism to resonate with broader audiences. Examination of surface classicism in popular performances therefore allows us to reconsider the relationship between classicism and cutting-edge technology, materiality and immateriality, liveness and mediation in the digital age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Conceptualizing the PD as "social participation," connecting learning to identity formation and change, this study investigates how a six-day inquiry-based summer teacher institute, focusing on the history of school desegregation, influenced the teachers' negotiation of changes in their role identities and learning to teach the topic as a difficult history. The research questions are: 1. How did the teacher's pre-PD role identity shape the ways they learn to teach difficult histories in the context of the PD? 2. To what extent and in what ways did the PD context impact the teacher's role identity shifts when learning to teach difficult histories? We used the Dynamic Systems Model of Role Identity (DSMRI; Kaplan &amp;amp; Garner, 2017) as a theoretical lens. Data sources include individual interviews conducted four times (before and after the summer institute and during and after the follow-up PD); lesson plans collected three times (before and after the summer institute and after the follow-up PD); video recordings of the PD sessions; and pre- and post-surveys. Qualitative data were analyzed using the DSMRI code book (Kaplan &amp;amp; Garner, n.d.). The analysis suggests teachers' prior experiences and self-perceptions about social identity categories (i.e., race and gender) influenced their learning and reflections on teaching difficult histories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>HIV Out Loud mobilizes the techniques of oral history to train medical students in skills of close listening, including making space for storytelling and taking a non-judgmental stance towards identities, behaviors and health conditions that are often stigmatized in healthcare settings. The project pairs medical student listeners with people living with HIV, to build an archive of stories of lives lived with HIV here in South Texas. Supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the project is currently in its second year. Eventually, the project will be integrated into the curriculum at UT Health San Antonio's Joe R and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine, thus creating a sustainable method for the compilation of this oral history for years to come.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this talk, I examine Kant's conception of personhood and situate the ideal of self-integration in Kant. I then discuss three ways in which one can fail to be a morally good person or to form a moral character. This discussion serves to examine the relationship between the demand for self-integration (or inner systematics) and the conditions of morality, especially the demand for the universalizability of one's principles of action, as well as the possibility of immorality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this talk, I develop a new reading of Kant's ideas of reason and their role in concept formation and knowledge acquisition. On this view, the regulative use of the ideas of reason has two functions: a semantic function in delimiting contexts of intelligibility and an epistemic function in projecting an ultimate context of evaluation. I conclude by discussing whether this reading can or should be classified as Hegelian.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Workshop Discussion of the Paper: This paper examines the role that the demand for self-integration, or for an inner systematic order and harmony, plays for Kant's conceptions of personhood, moral agency, and happiness. In contrast to a self-constitution view, such as that of Korsgaard (2009), it argues for a self-formation view, according to which the demand for self-integration is a regulative rather than constitutive principle for the psychological constitution of a person and a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of moral character. In the first part, the demand for self-integration is identified with the regulative principles of the non-moral idea of the soul, which have a normative function for the self-understanding and self-formation of persons. The second part focuses on its role in moral action and discusses whether the demand for self-integration is a necessary pre-condition for morality, and in particular for the formation of moral character. It answers this question by exploring three ways in which humans may fail to meet this demand. The third part examines whether compliance with this demand can contribute to personal happiness and considers possible external constraints to which the demand might be subject, given the state of the world (nature) as well as the will and psychological constitution of other people.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this talk, a new, contextualist interpretation of Kant's ideas of reason is presented and used to interpret Kant's philosophy of science. Drawing on contemporary analytic theories of contextuality, the first part argues that for Kant theoretical knowledge is sufficiently semantically determined and epistemically justifiable only in adequate contexts, and that ideas of reason are needed to demarcate and mentally map these contexts. Accordingly, the regulative use of ideas is not to produce descriptions of an existing or merely imagined metaphysical reality, but to exhibit two kinds of contexts: (i) contexts of intelligibility, within which a human subject can first of all conceive of her experience as a sufficiently semantically determined cognition of an object (of a certain kind), and (ii) contexts of evaluation, within which the truth of cognition could be ultimately judged in view of the world as it is in itself, and from whose projections normative standards for epistemic justifications can be derived. In the second part, this contextualist reading is applied to Kant's philosophy of science to explain Kant's claim that every single science is based on an idea of reason. For example, physics is founded on the idea of absolute space and psychology on the idea of the soul. In its semantic function, the idea of a science thus defines its largest possible context of intelligibility and thus its local ontology. In its epistemic function, this idea represents the ultimate context of evaluation, from the projection of which the standards of knowledge characteristic of the individual science can be obtained and the historical change of theories can be explained. In sum, the contextualist reading can be used to understand both the perspectivist nature of the human sciences and their necessary reference to a perspective-independent reality.</Abstract>

The regulative use of ideas is thus not to produce descriptions of an existing or merely imagined metaphysical reality, but to exhibit two kinds of contexts: (i) contexts of intelligibility, within which a human subject can first of all conceive of his experience as a sufficiently semantically determined cognition of an object (of a certain kind), and (ii) contexts of evaluation, within which the truth of cognition could be ultimately judged in view of the world as it is in itself, and from whose projections normative standards for epistemic justifications can be derived. In sum, the contextualist reading allows us to understand both the perspectival nature of human knowledge and its necessary reference to a perspective-independent reality.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Growing corn, squash, and beans, together in the same space during the same growing season is a traditional method of growing food for many Native Nations in the Upper Midwest and around this country. This production method has come to be called the Three Sisters. This presentation examines Three Sisters agriculture from the ground up, in order to contextualize how this cropping practice interacts with the environment it is placed into, particularly considering the impact on soil, and to more fully understand it's value as a food production method in 4 midwestern Native communities. Cultural ties in these Native communities to this cropping practice run very deep. Historically, Native Nations who chose to grow biodiverse cropping systems were able to combine the different characteristics within each plant to create a high-yielding environment that would allow them to harvest enough food not only to survive until the next growing season, but to fuel a robust trade economy. Because different plant species respond to challenging environmental issues in different ways, Native Nations using this cropping practice appears to be more sustainable than the modern practice of growing fields of a single-species monocrop when dealing with adverse weather events. Learning how different Native Nations interact with their Three Sisters gardens and the soils that support them may help motivate other Native people to consider gardening and enjoy the benefits.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores how historical recreation, particularly with handpress printing, can help us understand our own multi-/remediated era and new scholarly techniques in the digital humanities. We draw from our work with graduate and undergraduate students from UCSB, Cal State-Northridge, and Howard University on the Ballitore Project, a research initiative that brings together archival and digital methods to study the Ballitore Collection, an archive of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century correspondence held at UCSB Library's Special Research Collections. The project's summer internship involves students from the three campuses working at UCSB to learn skills in topic modeling and network analysis in order to visualize the archival materials in new ways. At the same time, they use the pull press housed in UCSB's Maker Lab to print a poem from the collection, which was originally assembled by the Anglo-Irish author Mary Leadbeater. Many of Leadbeater's poetry drafts are stored in the collection; in order to print them, students must make decisions about which versions to use and how to deal with erratic line breaks and inconsistent spelling. This process helps us understand the history of printing, in which eighteenth-century compositors would have to make similar decisions when setting Leadbeater's poems. But more importantly, it helps us think about processes of remediation and what is gained and lost not only in transforming manuscripts into print, but also in digitizing historical manuscripts and printed books. It reveals how Leadbeater did not see print as the apotheosis of her literary practice, but rather as one stage of production that would often be amended or superseded by later manuscript work. The process of setting type and printing reveals the multimedia nature of Leadbeater's authorial approach, of her initial archiving of the materials in the Ballitore Collection, and of the present-day process of digitization and computational analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk explores the complicated world of the eastern Mediterranean in the late fifth and sixth centuries in the topsy-turvy decades after the emperor Marcian affirmed the orthodoxy of the Council of Chalcedon in 451, a doctrine that remained hotly contested as subsequent emperors supported one side and then another of the debates, and positions proliferated further in response to ongoing efforts at compromise.  In 475, for example, the usurper Basiliscus issued an Encyclical that rejected Chalcedon, but ‘flip-flopped' just months later in his Anti-encyclical.  The emperor Zeno (r. 474-5, 476-91) hoped to find an acceptable compromise when he issued the Henotikon in 482, but since only some from each side supported the compromise, it fractured the church further.  After Zeno's death, many (but not all) anti-Chalcedonian Christians temporarily enjoyed support from the emperor Anastasius (r. 491-518), but the subsequent reign of Justin I (r. 518-27) was filled with more aggressive pro-Chalcedonian policies. Justin's successor Justinian (r. 527-65), with the empress Theodora, renewed efforts to find a compromise, but they were ultimately unsuccessful; the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 largely signaled an end to these efforts, and the reign of Justin II (r. 565-74) that followed became increasingly hostile to those who opposed imperial (i.e., Chalcedonian) orthodoxy.  In this context the markers of Christian orthodoxy were contested and its definition by any measure was wildly unstable.  In this chaos some Christians identified orthodoxy by imperial support (despite shifting doctrine), some patronized a particular church building (despite changing bishops), some adhered to a particular doctrine or followed a particular bishop as their fortunes waxed and waned, and still others seem to have hoped that their personal devotion to a life of asceticism would stand as a secure bulwark against doctrinal uncertainty.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper today will discuss John Rufus's Plerophoriae, from the anti-Chalcedonian monastic stronghold of Maiuma (Gaza) in the early sixth century during the supportive reign of the emperor Anastasius.  This essay argues that John Rufus deployed earlier saints' vivid visions of heaven and hell to forcefully pressure sixth-century Christians to avoid contact with anyone or any place associated with Chalcedonian Christianity.  Many visions and prophecies in this text, in fact, suggest that the Eucharist in particular should be understood as a focal point of the controversy, and that Chalcedonian and anti-Chalcedonian Christians were not nearly as distinct as John Rufus would have liked.  In another chapter of this project, I demonstrate that John of Ephesus's later texts claimed that late sixth-century anti-Chalcedonian Christians faced financial, social, political, and sometimes violent physical pressures to accept the Chalcedonian Eucharist.  I believe that examining the ways in which John Rufus earlier deployed depictions of an imminent afterlife and the Eucharist ritual in relation to the Chalcedonian controversy allows us to imagine daily interactions and concerns of early sixth-century Christians (and their leaders) in new and productive ways.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the late sixth century, the Christian leader John of Ephesus (ca. 507-88/9) wrote his Church History and Lives of the Eastern Saints.  By the middle of the seventh century, Muhammad's followers had taken control of many of the regions where anti-Chalcedonian (Miaphysite) Christians survived despite decades of imperial pressure, and by the late seventh and early eighth century, Muslims began to welcome non-Arab converts to Islam more freely.  In response, Syriac-speaking anti-Chalcedonian Christians produced texts like the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius [ca. 692, Miaph, 100km SE Nis] to combat the growing threat they believed Muslims posed to their community.  While scholars have studied Pseudo-Methodius's Apocalypse in this context, none have added John of Ephesus's texts to the discussion.  The only surviving manuscript of John's Lives (567-9) was produced in 688; part III of his Church History (577-88) appears to be written by the same scribe; and part II of his Church History (567-71) survives in one ninth-century manuscript that Pseudo-Dionysius incorporated into his Chronicle in the late eighth century.  This paper will highlight some of the thematic echoes between John of Ephesus's writings as they were preserved during the rise of Islam and the contemporaneous Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius (and were there time, thanks to Michael Penn's work, I could add John bar Penkaye's, Book of Main Points [ca. 687, E-Syr, 100km NE Nis], the Edessene Apocalypse [early 690s, Miaph, Ed], and the Apocalypse of John the Little [early 8th c, Miaph, Ed?]).  In this paper, I argue that John's texts, with their strong arguments about remaining steadfast in (anti-Chalcedonian) Christianity in the face of government persecutions and financial and political incentives to apostatize, resonated with Syriac-speaking anti-Chalcedonian Christians not only against the Chalcedonian empire of the sixth century, but also against Muslims in the late seventh and eighth centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the early sixth century, John Rufus circulated stories of saints' visions and prophecies that he argued proved the invalidity of the Council of Chalcedon (451), and in turn the orthodoxy of his own non-Chalcedonian community.  In some cases, John reported that a written document anathematizing the council had descended from heaven itself in the presence of witnesses.  John represented these stories as fifth-century predictions about, and early responses to, Chalcedon, but comparison with the writings of his contemporary non-Chalcedonian colleague Severus of Antioch reveals the powerful role that the stories of heavenly anathematizations of Chalcedon played in John's own context.  For his part, Severus explicitly mentioned sixth-century Christians' concerns about rejecting a council that had as many trappings of episcopal and imperial legitimacy as Chalcedon did.  Citing scripture and earlier church councils and saints, Severus argued that since the Council of Chalcedon had strayed from orthodoxy, neither it nor the clergy who adhered to it had the authority to anathematize or otherwise censor truly orthodox (non-Chalcedonian) Christians. With the methodical tools of his legal training, Severus countered his audience's fears that they and their clergy might be separated from God and the church on account of their rejection of this council, encouraging them to remain faithful to non-Chalcedonian clergy through the long-lasting conflicts. This essay will position John Rufus's Plerophoriae in his own time by reading its miraculous stories of heavenly anathemas in light of Severus of Antioch's concrete writings about earthly ones.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent events have underscored the danger that cow protection poses to religious and caste minorities in India, as Dalits and Muslims allegedly suspected of cattle-slaughter have been brutally assaulted or killed. These events have followed the strengthening of anti-slaughter laws.  Such laws originate with Article 48 of the Constitution of India, which directs the state to "endeavour to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines" and to "take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter" of cattle. In 1958, the Supreme Court cited Article 48 when it ruled it constitutional for the states to prohibit the slaughter of female cows.  Article 48 has been described as the product of a secularist compromise, in which Ambedkar and Nehru succeeded in couching cow protectionists' religious demands for a ban on cow-slaughter in the more neutral language of science and agriculture. But as Chigateri (2011, p. 146) has observed, Article 48 "reiterates the Hindu basis" of opposition to cow slaughter. As the restriction of slaughter came to be justified on secular grounds, minority rights were submerged or erased.  There was also a "Hindu basis" to the ostensibly secular framing of Article 48. Cow protectionists had used agricultural reasoning since Dayanand Saraswati in 1881. This paper details how such reasoning acquired a scaffolding of official and expert support in the last decades before independence. The colonial state has been praised for its secular stance on cow protection: colonial officials refused cow protectionists' demands by invoking the principle of religious neutrality, citing Muslims' right to sacrifice cattle at Bakr Id. Nonetheless, by 1948, alliances between colonial officials and cow protectionists had blurred any distinction between a secular or scientific concern with breed improvement, and a Hindu religious concern with preserving cattle life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Robert Solomon's "On grief and gratitude" is perhaps the best known contemporary philosophical article on grief. There Solomon makes the provocative claim that there is a duty to grieve – that those who do not grieve or do not grieve sufficiently are subject to "the most severe moral censure," that as a "moral emotion," grief is not only an "appropriate reaction to the loss of a loved one, but also in a strong sense obligatory." While Solomon offer reasons why grief speaks positively of a person's relations with others and why grief may contribute to the bereaved's well-being, he does not offer an explicit argument for the obligatoriness of grief. Here I consider a number of routes by which such a claim might be defended. If there is a duty to grieve, its object must be other living people (those with whom one shares grief at a particular person's death), the deceased for whom one grieves, or oneself. The first two, I argue, are likely to be candidates for duties of mourning, i.e., duties to engage in public or ritualistic memorialization or acknowledgements of the deceased's death, etc. Only the last, a duty to grieve owed to oneself, is a credible candidate for a duty to grieve. For insofar as grief is an egocentric activity, it responds to the death of a person with whom one stands in an identity-constituting relationship and hence involves the attempt to re-establish or place on new terms that relationship in light of that individual's death. The source of a self-concerning duty to grieve is that grief thus represents both an opportunity for, and motivator of, self-knowledge, that is, knowledge of one's practical identity and values. The duty to grieve, I conclude, is a non-enforceable duty to oneself whose non-fulfillment should elicit agent-centered regret.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A critical part of the conversion of 1.5 million Belarusian and Ukrainian Uniates to Orthodoxy in the 1830s involved transforming the all Uniate church interiors to meet the requirements for Orthodox services. This involved building iconostases, as well as removing organs and pulpits.  Additionally, impressive edifices were needed to house Orthodox cathedrals; these were, where possible, created by adding Orthodox elements to Roman Catholic churches that had been damaged or closed by the Russian authorities. This paper will investigate the extraordinary effort involved in carrying out these mandates, as well as the wide-spread difficulties in funding and implementing them, and assess the degree to which the religious landscape and material culture in Russia's western provinces lost many expressions of Polish and Catholic influence and began to reflect instead the Orthodox culture and modes of worship that were linked to Russia.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although the architecture of Spanish and Portuguese America today comprises one of the most flourishing subjects in the art-historical discipline the same cannot be said for that of the French Atlantic Empire, which astonishingly--except for regional scholarship on Quebec and a handful of buildings in Louisiana--does not exist as a field. This talk will provide a brief overview of the architectural heritage of the French Atlantic Empire (including the rich collection of plans and drawings in the archives in Aix-en-Provence and elsewhere) and will contextualize French America within the history of Latin American architecture, examining how differing ideologies and utopianisms among the French and Iberian empires led to strikingly contrasting architectural cultures despite shared histories of conquest, settlement, conversion, and forced labour. This paper will encompass North America, the French Antilles, French Guyana, and also Senegal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>El opulento Palacio Barroco de Sans-Souci, construido por el rey Enrique Christophe de Haití, es uno de los edificios más espectaculares pero menos estudiados de su época en el Hemisferio Occidental. Sus imponentes ruinas de ladrillo y piedra, gravemente dañadas por un terremoto de 1842, todavía dominan la modesta ciudad agrícola de Milot (a 45 minutos en coche de Cap-Haïtien), alguna vez, una plantación colonial. El palacio también se sitúa al pie del pico de Laferrière, de 969 metros de altura, coronado por la majestuosa Citadelle Laferrière, un castillo en las nubes invisible desde Milot pero construido durante la misma campaña y probablemente por muchas de las mismas personas. Iniciado el mismo año de la independencia haitiana (1804) por un hombre que se convertiría en el primer rey negro de América, la Ciudadela, como Sans-Souci, fue construida para demostrar la capacidad de Haití para enfrentar un mundo hostil en el que la mayoría de las naciones eran monarquías o imperios. El Palacio de Sans-Souci, que es una de las principales atracciones de la época turística de Haití en los años 40-50 y declarado Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la UNESCO desde 1982, nunca ha sido objeto de un estudio académico concentrado y ha generado una fértil red de mitos y especulaciones que se remontan a principios del siglo XIX.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Beginning in 1906, American colonial officials ordered the mandatory confinement of leprosy patients to the island of Culion, in western Philippines. American colonial authorities had downplayed Filipino opposition to the leper segregation policy. This paper examines how gender-based assumptions, state policies, and practices influenced reports on how the patients responded to gender segregation within the leper colony. Initially implemented in 1907, restrictions on marriage and cohabitation generated several protests, including the 1932 protest dubbed "The Manchuria." There is a paucity of sources written by the patients, but there are newspaper articles, government reports, and accounts of American colonial officials, nuns, and priests.   This paper seeks to advance our understanding of Filipino leprosy patients' engagement with American colonial authorities. This is an understudied theme in the existing literature on empire and public health policy and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Earlier studies on Filipino leprosy patients' resistance tend to focus on men. In this paper, I argue that some female patients asserted their sense of self and in so doing, rejected the notion of women as weak, mere followers of male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.</Abstract>

The effects of aging on the body include diabetes, dementia, high blood pressure, kidney and liver failure, cardio-vascular disease, etc.  This is a fascinating social experiment: a society that benefited from demography and human resources to become prosperous and cohesive is now getting hit with the other end of the stick!  Themes of "expiration" and exhaustion, the impact of humans on earth over 200,00 years are relevant in Japan now. What does it means to care for a nation to care for its people in these circumstances? What ethical implications for medicine and clinical decision-making?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will examine the ways that the Brown Berets remembered the U.S.-Mexico War to advance their political agendas in the 1970s. These Chicana/o civil rights activists invoked the nineteenth-century conflict to raise awareness of Mexican Americans' poverty and disenfranchisement in the twentieth century. In a 1971 march throughout the U.S. Southwest, the Brown Berets created alternative monuments to Mexican Americans who had fought on Mexico's behalf during the U.S.-Mexico War and also attempted to raise the Mexican flag at war landmarks as a reminder of Mexico's former claim to the land. This activism, I argue, illustrates activists' strategic use of war memories and the links between social and political issues. Each time activists recalled the war in their pamphlets, speeches, and/or media interviews, they reminded the nation of the long-term social consequences of the U.S.-Mexico War, the unfulfilled promises of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the justifications for civil rights activism. Moreover, by recalling the war and the treaty's promises in their campaigns, activists reinforced and modified their communities' collective memories, thus transmitting war memories across several generations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What does the common descriptive lexicon for instrumental sound tell us about how we conceptualize timbre? Perceptual studies have revealed a number of verbal attributes that reliably map onto timbral qualities, but the conventions of timbre description in spoken and written discourse remain poorly understood. Books on orchestration and instrumentation provide a valuable source of natural language used to describe qualities of instrumental timbre. Using methods from corpus linguistics, in this study I explore the conceptual features of timbre description through a quantitative analysis of a corpus of eleven popular orchestration treatises and manuals.  Timbre descriptors were manually extracted from the corpus, producing a total frequency of 3666 words (tokens) and 879 unique types. The five most frequent adjectives used to describe instrumental timbre were brilliant, rich, dark, full, and bright; the mean frequency was 4.5, and 12% of the dataset consisted of words or expressions that only occurred once. Data were also subdivided by instrument. To explore the underlying semantic structure of the word list, categories were generated through an inductive sorting process. The categorization scheme was validated with inter-rater reliability analysis, revealing seven conceptual classes of timbre descriptors: affect, matter, metaphor, mimesis, action, acoustics, and onomatopoeia. Log-linear analyses indicated statistically significant differences of category membership between orchestral instruments. I interpret these novel results through the lens of embodied music cognition and conceptual metaphor theory, and close with a discussion of the implications of this study for our broader understanding of the semantic space of timbre.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Jubilees Palimpsest Project is working to advance technologies for the recovery of text from illegible manuscripts through the phases of capture, processing, access, and scholarly collaboration. The project takes its name from the only copy of Latin Jubilees, which is joined by the only copies anywhere of the Testament of Moses and an Arian commentary on the Gospel of Luke. After the successful imaging of these erased texts in January of 2017, the scope of objects of interest broadened to other significant palimpsests at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, such as Origen's Hexapla and a fourth-century translation of biblical books into Gothic. A long-term plan to systematically digitize illegible manuscripts is underway. A major advance in capture and processing technology created by the project is Spectral RTI, which combines the advantages of spectral imaging in color processing with the advantages of RTI in texture and interactivity. The addition of texture imaging can aid the recovery of text-for example if now-missing ink left an outline of corrosion on the surface of the parchment-and much more information about scribal practices from the creation and use of the manuscript. With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the project is working to make the images and tools accessible to a wide range of scholars. Everything is free for non-commercial use and compliant with standards for discovery and access, such as the International Image Interoperability Framework. Free training will be available for scholars learning to utilize the image repository and for digitization projects learning to implement Spectral RTI.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The recovery of erased text on parchment by multispectral imaging is a relatively new field. New methods of text recovery are being developed every time another manuscript is imaged. To successfully recovery erased text requires a close partnership between the scholars that want to read the manuscript and the scientists that do the imaging. It is only through a close coordination of their efforts that the scholar can read the images that the scientist has produced, and the scientist understands what the text looks like that the scholar wants to read. This was never more evident than in the recent imaging and analysis of the Petermann II Nachtrag 24 palimpsest at the Staatsbibliotek zu Berlin. Examples from this effort will be used to illustrate a successful scholarly-scientific cooperation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Spectral imaging is the term used for collecting sets of images of objects under different wavelengths of light. Its value for the task of recovering erased, overwritten, or otherwise damaged historical texts is now well established, but new methods for processing the imagery are being developed continuously. This talk will outline the basic principles of spectral image processing, describe the methods that have been applied and demonstrate results that have been obtained for different types of historical documents, including palimpsests and maps.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract: This paper uses two major events that took place in a single year in Brazil's history—the 1872 implementation of the first national census and adoption of the metric system of weights and measures—to investigate the expanding reach of the Brazilian state in the nineteenth century. A continental-sized nation with poor infrastructure, Brazilian government agencies sought to improve their knowledge of and management of the vast country through systematic and extensive data collection and reporting. This interest in data collection was part of an international movement spearheaded by statistical societies and spread through international congresses that viewed statistical data as a means to improve exchange. The paper investigates the institutional history of the census and adoption of the metric system in 1872, focusing on the politics and policies behind their conception and design and the logistics of their implementation. It analyzes these innovations to tell the story of how Brazilian political leaders came to see them as valuable endeavors and how they envisioned the utility of both.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ramlila is an annual performance tradition in India that tells the story of the Hindu god Ram, typically over 10-15 days but sometimes up to a month. It has evolved from a recitative-pantomime style of ritualized performance on unbounded field(s) to a culturally hybrid form of mimetic theatre on an open-air proscenium stage. Drawing on extensive research at over twenty Ramlilas in the state of Uttar Pradesh, this paper considers the distinctive role of the svarups or those who play the parts of the divine leads. Beginning with the celebrated Ramlila at Ramnagar, this paper argues that conventions at this ‘preservationist' Ramlila work to performatively replicate existing social and gender hierarchies and normativities in Indian society, ones rooted in the nineteenth century when it was founded. Moving to ‘ordinary' neighborhood Ramlilas, it further suggests that although such productions are often more progressive in their casting, many of the actors who step onto the Ramlila stage are compelled to simultaneously enact a number of social embodiments, and this is especially true of the men who play the parts of svarups and female characters, and also the professional dancers who are sometimes brought in to entertain and occasionally, signal moral depravity. In sum, this paper shows that those who do the affective work of performing divinity and gender in Ramlila must conform to certain social expectations around class, caste, gender, and even skin tone.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Claudius Ptolemy wrote his Geography in the second century A,D., and following its rediscovery in Constantinople in about 1300, it became one of the most popular geographical texts of the European Renaissance, copied in many manuscripts and printed in many editions. But Ptolemy offers very little in the way of description of different regions and peoples, so the work came to be supplemented in various ways. Non-Ptolemaic descriptive texts were added to printed editions of the book, and users of the book added descriptive material from various sources, providing excellent evidence regarding the reception of the work and early modern reading practices.    In this talk I will examine the schemes of annotation in four different copies of the Geography: the 1511 Thacher copy at the Library of Congress; the copy of the 1513 edition at the Lilly Library; the 1486 Thacher copy at the Library of Congress; and the copy of the 1525 edition at Princeton. By comparing these different schemes of annotation I will bring out the extraordinary nature of the annotations in the Princeton 1525 Ptolemy, which is the object of my current NEH-Mellon fellowship research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The talk offers a brief discussion of the elaborate program of manuscript annotation in Princeton's copy of the 1525 edition of Ptolemy's Geography. The annotations were composed c. 1527, and are addressed to a student, and thus the annotations represent a program of geographical education in the early sixteenth century. The annotations were written by a scribe and their layout in the book was organized with great care, indicating that this copy was made for a very wealthy client. The annotator adds few references to modern history, but instead devotes his efforts to supplementing Ptolemy with descriptive texts culled from classical geographers, and from compilations such as Caelius Rhodiginus's Lectionum antiquarium and Marco Antonio Sabellico's Rapsodiae Historiarum Enneadum. In the Princeton copy, the annotated maps were combined with the unnanotated text of another copy of the book; the text of the 1525 edition annotated by the same annotator, which originally formed part of the same book with the Princeton maps, has been identified in a private collection in Europe.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Report on the archaeological evidence of a mid-second-millennium BC kingdom located in central western Anatolia. Discovered during the work of the Central Lydia Archaeological Survey in the Marmara Lake basin of the Gediz Valley in western Turkey, the material evidence appears to correlate well with text-based reconstructions of Late Bronze Age historical geography drawn from Hittite archives. The site of Kaymakçi Hoyuk stands out as a regional capital.  The results of the systematic archaeological excavation correlate with survey data to develop an understanding of the settlement and its region.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will examine the multiple ways the Brown Berets contested memories of conquest during their 1971 march throughout the U.S. Southwest. In the course of their "Caravana de la Reconquista," the Berets collected, interpreted, and promoted collective war memories. They visited various sites in the U.S. Southwest with ties to the U.S.-Mexico War, and invoked collective memories of the war to contest the nation's official history of the conflict. The Berets' symbolic "reconquest" of the region relied on reminding the region's residents of the tragic consequences of the U.S. conquest, challenging the "conquered" mentality among some Mexican Americans, and asserting Chicanos' claim to the land and to U.S. citizenship. These Chicana/o civil rights activists "remembered" the nineteenth-century conflict to raise awareness of Mexican Americans' contemporary poverty and disenfranchisement in the twentieth century. By linking the long-term consequences of the U.S.-Mexico War to the continued subordination of Mexican Americans, the Berets strategically used war memories to advance their political agenda. They highlighted Chicanos' continued subordination and its origins in the U.S.-Mexico War, detailed problems facing the Chicano community, and challenged official public memories of the nation's westward expansion. At various sites along their expedition, the Brown Berets also created alternative monuments to Mexican Americans who had fought on Mexico's behalf during the U.S.-Mexico War or who had fought to defend the Mexican community against European American attacks. Moreover, by recalling the war and the treaty's promises in their campaigns and press releases, activists reinforced and modified their communities' collective memories, thus transmitting war memories across several generations. This presentation is based on oral history interviews, memoirs, newspapers, and published scholarship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ethnographic museums and archives generally apply standardized terms in order to catalogue their collections, terms that are often incompatible with the cultural assumptions and values of the materials' originating communities. To explore this tension, we describe a current collaborative project that brings together anthropologists and Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl) to create a critical, annotated, digital edition of Franz Boas's first Northwest Coast monograph. In this 1897 text, Boas provided a typological foundation for concurrent and future museum classification of masks and other ritual regalia, along with their ceremonially associated songs, dances, and charter narratives. However, in this typological mode, multiple instantiations of diverse hereditary prerogatives became mere tokens of a common type, thereby stripping out core cultural meanings. Our current challenge is to build a digital metadata structure responsive to Indigenous ontologies of the object where the immaterial—genealogical rights and title to specific masks—is more durable and essential than the material. In such cases, ephemeral genealogical data might be the most significant "artifacts" to preserve—a point forcefully made by Boas's primary Native collaborator, George Hunt, over the decades of their work together.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1937, a group of businessmen organized as the Association of Arts and Industries, on the recommendation of Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius, invited the Hungarian artist and designer László Moholy-Nagy to Chicago to reestablish the Bauhaus school of design, which the Nazis had shut down in 1933.  Moholy-Nagy, who was exiled in England at the time, had been a member of the Bauhaus faculty and was a close associate of Gropius, who had turned down the Association's offer to lead the school.  Although the New Bauhaus was forced to close in 1938 after less than a year in operation due to the Association's withdrawal of financial support, Container Corporation president Walter Paepcke helped Moholy to establish the School of Design in Chicago in 1939, which retained the Bauhaus pedagogy and much of its faculty, including the Hungarian artist György Kepes.  Moholy led the design school, which changed its name to the Institute of Design in 1944, until his death in 1946.  Drawing on archival resources at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois, Chicago, this paper looks at Moholy's immigration to the United States and his close relationship with Paepcke, an arts patron who created jobs for other Bauhaus designers including Herbert Bayer.  Moholy and Paepcke attempted to incorporate the socialistic Bauhaus pedagogy with the practical demands of capitalistic American business, and their close personal and professional relationship reveals much about the extent to which such a cultural and economic fusion was possible.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past few years, the Humanities have been confronting a paradigm shift. After the Cultural and Linguistic turns of the 1970s and 1980s, language, meaning, representation, agency, othering, and knowledge-production redefined the Humanities. Now, in 2016, new media, climate change, environmental catastrophe, terrorism, genetic engineering, population growth, and globalization, destabilize the core of the Humanities. These forces (hyperobjects?) are largerthan-human. They are seismic. They are shifting intellectual terrain. And they require a change of perception, a new vision for a new century. As the macro, the "beyond-the-human," quake the ballast of the Humanities, animals have emerged from the fault lines and fissures. Though animals were domesticated, commodified, and ultimately silenced between the late-Paleolithic and the Present, their voices have begun to resound across the Humanities as it turns toward the Anthropocene. This paper will explore the ways in which animal voices are reverberating within the historical profession. After tracking animals through the environmental history of the 1990s and 2000s, this paper will look toward the new horizons of "animal history." Not only will this paper seek to define this emerging field, but it will outline the ways that "animal history" (indeed animals themselves) can creatively uncover a livelier, more truthful, and complex past buried beneath an anthropocentric historical tradition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Franz Boas's 1897 report, The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians, was a landmark in anthropology for its integrative approach to museum collections, photographs, and sound recordings as well as text. A result of participant observation and extensive collaboration with Indigenous partners—especially George Hunt—the book set a standard for both ethnography and museum practice. However, both Boas and Hunt remained dissatisfied with the published text, laboring for decades to correct and supplement a volume that would forever mediate global knowledge of the Kwakwaka'wakw. They left behind a vast archive of unpublished materials relevant to the creation and afterlife of this seminal text and its related museum collections. These materials are now widely distributed across institutional, disciplinary, and international borders; related ethnographic records have become fractured, thereby limiting the documentary potential at each site and the research possibilities for both scholars and Native communities. This paper discusses a current collaborative project to create an annotated critical edition of the work that unites published and unpublished materials with one another and with Kwakwaka'wakw knowledge in an interactive, multimedia website. Archival revelations about the truly co-authored nature of the original text allow us to better situate the contexts and methods of creating ethnographic knowledge in terms of the Indigenous ontologies it purports to represent. Moreover, digital technologies can harness multimedia to return sensory richness to Boas and Hunt's synthetic text, to reactivate disparate and long dormant museum collections, and to restore cultural patrimony to its Indigenous inheritors.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Franz Boas's 1897 monograph, The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians, was a landmark in anthropology for its integrative approach to ethnography, the use of multiple media, and the collaborative role of Boas's Indigenous partner George Hunt. Not only did the volume draw on existing museum collections from around the world, the two men also left behind a vast and now widely distributed archive of unpublished materials relevant to the creation and afterlife of this seminal text, including hundreds of pages of Hunt's corrections and emendations. This paper discusses an international and intercultural collaborative project to create a new, annotated critical edition of the book--in both print and digital formats--that unites published and unpublished materials with one another and with current Kwakwaka'wakw knowledge. We catalogue the range of museum collections and archival materials at issue and present an interactive prototype for the digital edition that re-embeds ethnographic knowledge within Indigenous epistemological frameworks and hereditary protocols for access. This unprecedented effort within anthropology promises new ways of using digital media to link together disparate collections and Native communities in order to produce a critical historiography of the book while recuperating long dormant ethnographic materials for use in current and future cultural revitalization.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This session features two innovative, collaborative projects using digital media to link diverse collections and Native American communities with goals of enhanced scholarship and cultural revitalization. The first is an effort to reunite Franz Boas and George Hunt's 1897 monograph on the "Kwakiutl Indians" with widely distributed museum collections and unpublished archival materials, and includes a prototype for a critical digital edition built on Indigenous ontologies and hereditary protocols. The second, GRASAC, explores convergence, bringing together digitized heritage and language items from archival, ethnographic, and archaeological collections, while also interweaving Great Lakes Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge protocols and research methodologies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The use of digital tools for data creation and presentation is pervasive in archaeology, and data preservation and dissemination is becoming common practice. Still, few archaeologists consider the life of their data beyond their own research purposes. This lack of broader consideration of the future uses of a dataset means that many researchers do not sufficiently describe their data to make it intelligible or useful to others, which risks filling repositories with data of very limited use. We present findings from the Secret Life of Data (SLO-data) project, which aims to better understand opportunities and challenges in data interpretation, publication and preservation by following the lifecycle of data from the field to the digital repository. The project's "slow data" approach emphasizes the need for thoughtful consideration of archaeological data, taking into account its curation, contextualization, and dissemination, as well as how it can contribute to broader understanding now and in the future. We share results from interviews, field observations, and excavation data assessments that our team has conducted at four field sites in three continents. We recommended technical and organizational changes to streamline data collection and management during excavations that will help improve its potential for future use.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a recent "Introspective Digital Archaeology" blog post,Jeremy Huggett asked frank questions about the feasibility of reusing data that archaeologists archive in digital repositories (https://introspectivedigitalarchaeology.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/digital-data-realities/). Despite years of investment in high-profile digital archive programs,data still sees little reuse. Huggett asks whether data are still too siloed, with too little linking for effective discovery and reuse. If so, what measures can we take to better capitalize on research data management so that data reuse becomes more commonplace? Forum discussants will consider digital archaeology beyond the current status quo of "data management" to better situate the sharing and reuse of data in archaeological practice. Within this theme, the panel will discuss data stewardship and preservation, new pathways for interpretation and science, the place of "big data" in archaeology, public engagement, transparency, public policy,compliance, and improving digital literacy. How do we envision the future of digital archaeological data and what ethical implications should we consider? Given the realities of funding and the structure of academic institutions, are these visions realistic?If so, what do we need to do to get there? If not, how can we adjust our visions to fit with these digital data realities?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Ballitore Project is an ongoing study of the Quakers in Ballitore, Ireland, during the late eighteenth century. Interns for the project transcribe the letters of these Quakers and study the context behind their religion and culture. This past summer, I–along with three other interns–presented a network analysis on those letters, which focused on the demographics of both the letter writers and recipients. In my portion of the Ballitore Quaker network analysis, I discuss the gender and religion demographic in the Ballitore letters. For example, I come to the conclusion that Richard Shackleton, a prominent religious leader in the Ballitore letters, corresponded with a fairly equal number of both men and women because of his religious mentorship towards both sexes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent work in archival studies and bibliography has emphasized how an ethics-of-care framework can help us make sense of the temporal, geographical, and sociological dislocations involved with reading correspondence, journals, and other primary sources from earlier periods. Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor call for a shift in scholarly models "from one based on individual rights to a model based on a feminist ethics of care." This presentation will discuss a project that seeks to put into practice ethics of care in a collaborative project building a digital scholarly edition of archival materials. The Ballitore Project, a collaboration between UCSB, CSUN, and Howard University, investigates an archive of 18th- and 19th-century Irish Quaker correspondence held at UCSB Library's Special Research Collections. While the Ballitore Quakers were a small, provincial community—and the collection itself centers on the close-knit Shackleton family—they engaged political causes such as abolitionism, but this was a paternalistic abolitionism that entirely excluded Black voices from their correspondence. In the process of creating a digital edition of the collection for public access, the Ballitore Project seeks to address such absences by foregrounding collaborative, non-hierarchical research teams that draw from racially and socioeconomically diverse students and that cross the borders between campuses, between faculty, student, and librarians, and between pedagogy and research. The collaboration has also recently grown to include the public through the use of the Zooniverse platform for crowd-sourcing transcriptions. A care framework helps us address the problems and contradictions within the collection while valuing Quaker ideals of egalitarianism both in the past and present.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the Romantic period's most significant and prominent public rhetorical campaigns was that of the abolitionist campaign, which emerged in Great Britain in the late eighteenth century with a focus on ending the trade in enslaved humans. Quakers have been credited with an outsized role in the effort, as they represented nine out of the twelve founding members of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. But at the same time, Quaker abolitionism was often not antiracist, with many Quakers advocating "repatriation" for formerly enslaved people. This paper will take a book historical approach to such contradictions using the materials of the Ballitore Collection, an archive of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Irish Quaker materials held at UCSB Library's Special Research Collections. The collection shows how Quakers outside London created consensus around abolitionism, as they circulated letters with excerpts from the correspondence of other prominent Quakers—such as Edward Rushton and John Woolman—advocating for abolition. For example, in 1807, Samuel Haughton sent his friend Mary Leadbeater a letter in which he excerpted a separate letter from Rushton to John Hancock in which Rushton noted, "I wish politicians &amp;amp; philosophers would learn to be consistant Jefferson the president of the united states, the freest country in the world, holds hundreds of his fellow creatures in a state of bondage, and Horne Tooke the celebrated English patriot is an enemy to the abolition of the slave trade" [sic]. In this way, individual correspondents developed a communal approach to abolitionism, which became a central part of Quaker identity. However, the Ballitore Collection shows how Quakers were not concerned to include Black people in their movement—there are no Black voices in the collection and all of the materials about abolitionism are from a white perspective.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Interdisciplinary courses have played a key role in teaching challenging and complex issues to students.  Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and humanities fields (i.e., arts, reading, music, etc.) have been blended to cultivate creative thinking and problem-solving, particularly for STEM students.  Expanding these efforts, the Texas Tech University (TTU) Honors College has created humanities-driven STEM (HDSTEM) courses.  These HDSTEM courses are team-taught with a STEM and humanities faculty.  Because the humanities have been argued to produce students with higher levels of empathy, an HDSTEM course was devised that blends technical problem-solving with the humanities and asks students to empathize.  Discourse and content analysis of problem-solving assignments was performed to analyze changes in empathetic depositions for Honors students.  An empathy rubric was used to baseline and score empathy levels as students progressed through the course.  Students' problem-solving assignments generally showed more empathetic positioning during the semester than at the start of the semester.  This HDSTEM course successfully blended STEM and humanities by having students consider technical and "hard science" aspects of their assignments while asking them to empathize and think more deeply about the discipline's social, political, and ethical implications.  Further, this work shows that the humanities within a STEM context can foster an empathetic disposition.  This session will discuss the results of this study, provide details on how HDSTEM is being further implemented within TTU's Honors curriculum, and discuss lessons learned for implementation into other colleges/programs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We explore how coursework at the intersection of STEM and humanities might increase empathetic dispositions for undergraduate engineering students. This study takes place in an honors-based history/technology course focusing on World War II, co-taught by a professor of history and professor of engineering. Throughout the course, students completed projects in which they were asked to reverse engineer technical problems of WWII, but were sometimes asked to "empathize," considering broader social and humanitarian concerns associated with their technical problems. Using discourse analysis to examine how students empathized when instructed, we found that they had more to write, were able to align themselves with stakeholders in the wars, better anticipated readers' needs, and wrote with more subjective, rather than objective voices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bartolina Sisa, warmi: Indigenous Women Outside the Script    Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui argues that words can cover up reality as much as represent it within a colonial setting. Cusicanqui herself, in writing about the 1781 La Paz rebellion led by Tupac Katari, does not mention his wife Bartolina Sisa or his sister, Gregoria Apaza, even though their contributions to the rebellion have been extensively documented (Valle de Siles, Thomson, Lewin). Both women fought alongside him and were hanged as a form of public spectacle, together, in what is today la Plaza Murillo, La Paz. In the official archival account of the events of 1781, we only know Sisa through the pen of others, and always via a translator, as she spoke Aymara. And yet, contemporary images, plays, films, songs, and stories proliferate about her. In Cusicanqui's La sociología de la imagen (Tinta Limón 2015), she proposes a methodology that puts the body at the center of practices of seeing in order to challenge Cartesian ocularcentrism, delinking visualization from its ties to language. Putting this methodology into practice in an attempt to encounter Sisa, I begin with an 1888 map of the La Paz rebellions by Florentino Olivares, which I argue is a harbinger of the continued rebellion of indigenous peoples, rather than a representation of their defeat. Second, I look at the way that indigenous peoples' ways of knowing through the landscape, as signaled in the play "La lanza capitana" (1962) by Raúl Botelho Gosálvez, casts doubt about the lettered class's ability to orient themselves amongst their surroundings, regardless of maps. And third, I turn to the song "Bartolina Sisa, warmi" made famous by Luzmila Carpio (1949 - ), arguably the most prolific indigenous singer of the Andes. The Quechua lyrics and sounds to "Bartolina Sisa, warmi" come from songs her grandmother and mother sang to her, and whose origin is impossible to trace.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As my research on Bartolina Sisa has unfolded, I concern myself with approaching Sisa, like the comic Tupaj Katari does, as an active protagonist of the present. In the book project, titled Back to the Future: The Archival Afterlives of Bartolina Sisa,  I work beyond the established archive to demonstrate that through 19th century paintings, 20th-century theatre, film and radio, and 21st-century film and performance art, Sisa and her cultural doubles come into view: in and beyond Bolivia. Each iteration of Sisa, and the indigenous and mestizo/a persons that animate her, speaks to the ways she defies reductionist classification and iconic fetishization as she moves across temporal and geographic scales. The difficulty of tracing Sisa from the archive, coupled with her persistent reproduction, challenges an approach to knowledge based on an original, the privileging of written text over oral traditions, and the notion that indigenous peoples are destined to disappear. That said, in project, I also want to avoid romantic generalizations that would see the reproduction of Sisa as uniformly "decolonial" or emancipatory.  Instead, my research program is based on two broad questions (ONE) How do Andean indigenous peoples navigate modernity in contradictory ways that can inform global indigenous studies?  (TWO) How do literature and the arts enable us to perceive these contradictions and learn from them?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In December 1946, the Northwest German Radio (NWDR) in Hamburg, Germany published the first issue of the radio magazine, Hör Zu (Listen Up!). Modeled on the popular pre-war radio program guides found throughout Europe and the United States (such as Radio Life), the periodical provided its readers with an up-to-date schedule of the weekly broadcasts of Germany's various regional radio stations, and employed images and short articles to incite interest in radio programs and personalities. Yet, for the first two years of its existence, it also included new features, aimed to offer a "behind the scenes" glimpse into the radio production process, demystifying the "miracle wireless" and turning it into a space for the open exchange of ideas. In so doing, the publication of Hör Zu marked a notable turning point in the history of the radio in Germany. Under National Socialism, the radio had served as a primary instrument of propaganda dissemination and its ideal listener was imagined to be the passive receptor of the party's message. Hör Zu's new vision for the radio, in contrast, was emphasized in the request for listener feedback found in the mission statement on the first issue's opening pages: "Don't be afraid of a public response," the editors claimed, "We no longer live under the whip of a dictator!" In the eyes of its creators, Axel Eggebrecht and Peter Zahn, Hör Zu marked the dawn of a new age of radio, in which the audience would be transformed into actively engaged and critical listeners.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores the themes of music and exile in the genre of the Funkoper – operas written specifically for the radio medium – in postwar German culture. Its primary case study is the collaboration between German-Jewish writer Wolfgang Hildesheimer and composer Hans Werner Henze, Das Ende einer Welt, adapted from Hildesheimer's short story in Lieblosen Legenden (1952), and broadcast on the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk in December 1953. This paper explores how the skewed perceptions of time and space that Hildesheimer associated with his own experience of exile are "sounded" in the text through his musical language and references, and then capitalized upon by Henze's musical score and its use of quotation and collage. Both author and composer, I claim, exploit the unique expressive properties of the radio to create a sense of acoustic compression or claustrophobia, and temporal stasis. In its conclusion, this paper reflects on how genres such as the Hörspiel and Funkoper offered new opportunities for individual and collective working through the past in postwar German culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>he critical study of the Babylonian Talmud has advanced considerably over the last half-century, primarily by focusing on the diachronic development of sugyot, which have been appreciated as primarily comprising earlier amoraic dicta (and earlier tannaitic sources)  in Hebrew, framed and put into motion by generally later editorial discussions in Aramaic. While this is a crucial insight, it cannot suffice as a comprehensive account of what the Talmud is as a compilation. For example, scholars have largely left unexplored the synchronic shape of the Bavli as a whole, which comprises a mix of materials that are devoted to the interpretation of the Mishnah and related discussions, and "digressive" sources which are included within the fabric of the text.   In this paper I present my ongoing project to map these "digressions" using CATMA (Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis), and considers some literary, functional, and (cross-)cultural meanings of the "Sea of Talmud.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2021-2022, Nevada State's NEH Humanities Connections Planning Grant team developed a series of Intercultural Competency Learning Benchmarks that reflect our investments as an HSI/MSI/AANAPI institution. Our core principles were: 1) intercultural competency must address the vibrant interculturalism of our own identities and of our local communities; and 2) intercultural learning must be rooted in praxis. During our session, you'll discover how our benchmarks already exist within what you do in your classes and collaborate with colleagues on how you can tweak an objective, assignment, or activity to enhance intercultural learning – no matter your discipline!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Americans are both a people in motion and strongly dedicated to place. This session, presented by the Division of Education Programs of the National Endowment for the Humanities, examines how teachers, students, and public humanities experts create experiential learning opportunities to understand the intersection of place and movement in humanities education. The roundtable discussion will feature directors of four NEH-supported projects.  The Landmarks of American History and Culture program funds professional development workshops that help teachers understand the importance of place. These workshops bring together scholars, public historians, and other partners to engage K-12 educators in the study of sites of historic and cultural significance across the United States. Understanding place, of course, requires understanding borders, migration, and other kinds of movement.  The panel will include directors from two recent Landmarks programs: one on the forced movement of Japanese Americans to incarceration camps during WWII and the other on the multi-ethnic and multi-generational migration of people to the San Joaquin Valley.  The agency's Humanities Connections program, on the other hand, helps teachers and students at college and universities cross intellectual and institutional boundaries between humanities and non-humanities disciplines. These awards support partnerships between humanities faculty and their counterparts in the social and natural sciences and in pre-service or professional programs. They help faculty create interdisciplinary majors, minors, pathways, certificates, and other undergraduate programs incorporating experiential learning. The panel will include directors from two recent Humanities Connections projects: one is developing an intercultural competency concentration for education, nursing, and business students; the other is creating a general education pathway for engineering students that is grounded in philosophy and ethics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through an experimental design-based research project—funded by the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)—this study explored intersections of sound art, mobile technologies, and the accessibility of national parks through the creation of a novel form of audio description. We decided to make this piece of locative sound art— designed primarily for people who are Deafblind, blind, or who have low-vision—at the site of Andy Goldsworthy's four outdoor public art installations within the Presidio in San Francisco. During our design process, we encountered many complexities demanding design attention and forcing difficult artistic choices, including about approaches to the vocal performance, the dualistic proximity of listeners to the artwork (they were either on site or off), and to the quirks of the physical environment, including about how to handle an alleged arson of one of the artworks that happened mid-development and closed the area to visitors. As these complications were revealed, we rejected reductionism and the impulse to solely focus on the content, the medium, or the mobilities. We stuck to the philosophy that all were co-equally important and approached the design development accordingly. We then gathered feedback about this audio description from representative audience members, which included on-site tests with five individuals, facilitated by a research team member. We used a think-aloud protocol, during which participants talked about their responses to the audio files in the moment. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with the individuals after each visit. In addition, we built an online review system as a part of the support software that allowed other representative audience members to listen to the prototype and answer either open-ended or Likert-like questions remotely. We had 20 volunteers who reviewed both the sound-art and the utilitarian versions via that system. We also hosted a focus group for a mix of the on-site and off-site</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Digital Video Commander project seeks to reframe the entire paradigm of preservation when applied to digital videotapes rather than adopt upon the practices used for analog videotape. Capturing the contents of a digital videotape does not need to be as restrained as attempting to record an ideal, singular presentation of a videotape, but there is a potential that such effort could mimic the more accurate data transfers of hard drives or sectored optical discs where the quality of the data transferred could be verified piece-by-piece and retried as needed to create a more accurate result.   During the NEH R&amp;amp;D funded project, DV Rescue, MIPoPS has found that digitization software does not need to solely work as a diligent scribe that documents the contents recorded on legacy videotapes, but that such software can take control of the hardware, guide the user, automate actions, and orchestrate the entire reformatting event. Such an approach requires skilled development, but the results place this essential preservation practice within reach for more collecting institutions who would benefit from it while producing more accurate representations of digital videotape contents than is currently feasible with more traditional workflows. Additionally, whereas expert calibration of analog signals is essential for presenting data loss while digitizing analog videotapes, the opposite is somewhat true for digital videotapes, where signal manipulation of the digital videotape decoding adds generational loss rather than accuracy. We see that the characteristics of digital videotape provide an opportunity for automation, ease, and increased accuracy within the preservation of digital videotapes and the potential to promote project results in a way that reduces barriers for institutions seeking to establish in-house audiovisual preservation services.  In this presentation we will highlight the research, trials and documentation undertaken and created to facilitate deck control.</Abstract>

Falling in-between professional expertise in file-based digital preservation and analog videotape digitization, DV tapes are best preserved by migrating the data from the tape into a file rather than handling them as a video digitization event. This panel will review the past two years of work on the DVRescue project. Funded by the NEH, DVRescue worked to research DV preservation and create new tools and documentation to facilitate the efficient transfer of data from tape to file. The presenters will demonstrate current versions of the tool, research conclusions, methods for troubleshooting, as well as how they will utilize findings to inform future work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 2019, MIPoPS and RiceCapades has worked on the NEH funded DVRescue project, developing the procedures, tools and documentation to assist audiovisual archivists with preserving their DV videotapes. Through this work, we have developed, tested and modified a variety of tools and documentation that encompass a set of best practices we recommend to the greater archival community for all aspects of DV videotape preservation, including capturing, troubleshooting, analyzing, and quality control. The DVRescue team will provide some updates on the project and demonstrate the latest builds. Members of the archival community participating in the DVRescue project will describe their experience and practical application of the tools.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dedicated comics-studies programs are few and far between; even more rare, a slate of comics courses that explores the power of comics to engage with social justice issues! This roundtable describes the process of building a complete comics and social justice curriculum from the ground up… a curriculum that explores the power of comics over time to grapple with tough social issues and comics' unique ability to promote empathy. Put simply, the ever-changing medium of comics is a change-maker and our program intends to harness that transformational power! Upon SDSU's foundation of already-existing courses focused on comics and history, comics and sequential media, and graphic histories, faculty are preparing courses across the curriculum on such topics as ChicanX comics, Native Americans in comics, African-Americans in comics, Visual Rhetoric of Comics, Comics for Teachers, Religion in/of Comics, and more! In the course of our discussion, we'll share our process (including the curriculum mapping process), library/collections support, our public-facing deliverables and dissemination plan, and examples of two of the courses we're developing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars who study comics and graphic novels have long recognized their perpetuation of harmful stereotypes; but also, more recently, comics' capacity to challenge injustice. Through comics' engagement with issues like racial discrimination, gender inequality, sexual identity, immigration, and climate justice, the ever-changing medium is itself a change-maker. Institutions can take advantage of that disruptive power of comics to address principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. To that end, our institution is halfway through a grant-funded undertaking to 1) develop ten new courses that will deepen and expand our comics curriculum (especially with regard to social justice issues) and 2) use these courses to create a certificate in Comic Studies at our Hispanic- and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. This paper provides an interim report on our initiative, anticipating that the successes we've managed and the challenges we've faced (some resolved, others outstanding) will offer a blueprint for other institutions looking to jumpstart their own comics curriculum. We'll describe our multi-stage process of curriculum building - from needs/resources assessment (existing courses, faculty, and library resources) to course development concurrent with curriculum design. We'll share some highlights of the five new courses developed in AY 2022/23 (addressing such issues as LGBT+ and African-American representation, Chicanx identity, Cold War fears, and Comics Rhetoric) and a sneak peek at courses we'll be developing in Year Two. Attendees at our session will leave with access to syllabi and lesson plans for at least seven comics and social justice-inflected classes, our provisional degree-learning outcomes matrix for a comics certificate, and ideas about implementing a similar comics curriculum at their own institution. Such an approach to the study of comics, and a curriculum that uses comics to engage social justice issues, stands to</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An ongoing challenge in current natural language processing is how its major advancements tend to disproportionately favor resource-rich languages, leaving a significant number of under-resourced languages behind. Due to the lack of resources required to train and evaluate models, most modern language technologies are either nonexistent or unreliable to process endangered, local, and non-standardized languages. Optical character recognition (OCR) is often used to convert endangered language documents into machine-readable data. However, such OCR output is typically noisy, and most word alignment models are not built to work under such noisy conditions. In this work, we study the existing word-level alignment models under noisy settings and aim to make them more robust to noisy data. Our noise simulation and structural biasing method, tested on multiple language pairs, manages to reduce the alignment error rate on a state-of-the-art neural-based alignment model up to 59.6%.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Perso-Arabic scripts are a family of scripts that are widely adopted and used by various linguistic communities around the globe. Identifying various languages using such scripts is crucial to language technologies and challenging in low-resource setups. As such, this paper sheds light on the challenges of detecting languages using Perso-Arabic scripts, especially in bilingual communities where "unconventional" writing is practiced. To address this, we use a set of supervised techniques to classify sentences into their languages. Building on these, we also propose a hierarchical model that targets clusters of languages that are more often confused by the classifiers. Our experiment results indicate the effectiveness of our solutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>There has been recent interest in improving optical character recognition (OCR) for endangered languages, particularly because a large number of documents and books in these languages are not in machine-readable formats. The performance of OCR systems is typically evaluated using automatic metrics such as character and word error rates. While error rates are useful for the comparison of different models and systems, they do not measure whether and how the transcriptions produced from OCR tools are useful to downstream users. In this paper, we present a human-centric evaluation of OCR systems, focusing on the Kwak'wala language as a case study. With a user study, we show that utilizing OCR reduces the time spent in the manual transcription of culturally valuable documents – a task that is often undertaken by endangered language community members and researchers – by over 50%. Our results demonstrate the potential benefits that OCR tools can have on downstream language documentation and revitalization efforts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Through establishing and developing Sustainability Tools in Cultural Heritage (STiCH) we have learned valuable lessons that we will share in this presentation. The 30,000 hits on the STiCH website demonstrate the appetite for guidance in effective sustainable choices. Overall, we have learned the benefit in providing specific direction towards sustainable practices that professionals can grasp and initiate. The STiCH Carbon Calculator look-up tool and Library of Case Studies provide data that guides and empowers professionals as they continue to explore and implement new, lower impact methods. In this talk we will reference the findings of the Case Studies and the guidance provided by the Carbon Calculator to illustrate our overall lessons learned.  Through our project we have learned the importance in collaboration between fields to support sustainable practices. We will discuss lessons learned in creating effective tools for sustainable practices specific to cultural heritage preservation, and how the valuable, clear link between LCA methods and preservation practices provides a route for effective collaboration. Collaboration between these two specialties has opened the central question: "at what cost are we preserving our cultural heritage?" As conservators, we know that preserving our cultural heritage for future generations is sustainable at its core, and as we explore sustainable goals we emphasize that "green" practices are not about stopping work. Instead, informed choices and sustainable thinking improves professional methods, requires creative approaches, and reduces environmental impacts. Creative thinking is the core of conservation practices and integral to our work.  As useful as LCA is, it by no means provides an easy one-stop answer. Sustainability is a multi-pronged goal and conservators will achieve this goal and use their discoveries as they work to not only preserve our heritage but our planet.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Unruly Inmates" of Culion  Beginning in 1906, American colonial officials ordered the mandatory confinement of leprosy patients to the island of Culion. This paper explores female patient activism in Culion during the early twentieth century. It focuses on patients' reaction to restrictions on marriage and cohabitation, first implemented in 1907. These regulations generated several protests, including the 1932 protest dubbed "The Manchuria." There is a paucity of sources on patients' responses written by the patients themselves, but there are government reports, accounts of colonial officials, and accounts by the nuns and priests who lived in Culion. Government reports tended to characterize the male patients as the leaders. Accounts of nuns and priests illuminate their paternalistic view of female patients as wards who needed to be protected from male patients. Yet, a close reading of accounts of health officials and admission records reveal the presence of "unruly" women and the consequences of their participation in these "disturbances."   This paper seeks to advance our understanding of Filipino leprosy patients' engagement with American colonial authorities. This is an understudied theme in the existing literature on empire and public health policy and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. The existing literature on leprosy patients' resistance tends to focus on men. In this paper, I argue that some female leprosy patients asserted their sense of self and in so doing, rejected the notion of women as weak, mere followers of male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While most research on American race relations has utilized a binary analytical lens—examining either "black" vs. "white" or "Anglo" vs. "Mexican"—CRBB collects, interprets, and disseminates new oral histories with members of all three groups.   CRBB is a multifaceted project: directed by three history professors and a journalism professor and assisted by dozens of community partners, it employs graduate students who conduct and video-record the oral histories. Interviews are clipped, tagged, and uploaded along with metadata to a website that is already being used by K–12 teachers. The project directors are analyzing interviews and writing a statewide history of black and brown civil rights organizing in Texas. The roundtable will discuss issues that have arisen in each of these facets of the project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>References to slavery in the epistles of the apostle Paul play a climactic role in the oeuvre of influential political philosopher Giorgio Agamben. In order to challenge Agamben's account of what he terms "anthropogenesis"—the becoming human of the human being—I offer an alternative reading of selected passages in Paul.  The nine volumes of Agamben's Homo Sacer project begin with a distinction Agamben attributes to Aristotle, a distinction between mere biological life (zoe) and politically conditioned life (bios). The passage in the Politics giving rise to this distinction continues with a discussion of natural slavery. It is thus strange that in the first eight Homo Sacer volumes Agamben does not consider the figure of the slave to exemplify what he terms "bare life," precarious life supposedly shorn of bios. Instead, he names the banned man, the obscure homo sacer of Roman law. Against Agamben's nomination of the banned man as epitome of bare life, I propose instead a banned woman--Paul's Hagar. By "Paul's Hagar," I mean both the Hagar Paul reads in the pages of the Septuagint and the Hagar he writes in his allegory in Galatians (4:21-5:1). Readings of Hagar by feminist and womanist scholars both anticipate Agamben's account of bare life and expose the reductive limits of that account.  My paper primarily focuses on Hagar and bare life. As a coda, I conclude with a brief philological critique of The Use of Bodies, the final Homo Sacer installment. Fixating on Aristotle's definition of slavery in terms of "use of the body," Agamben at last considers implications of slavery for conceptions of the human. The useful Onesimus offers a counterweight to Agamben's claim that for Paul the figure of the slave represents a messianic hope for becoming human (cf. 1 Corinthians 7:21).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In recognition that NWA 2018 is held in a federally-recognized Tribal nation and in keeping with this year's theme, Moving Image Preservation of Puget Sound (MIPoPS) will screen archival footage relating to the Indigenous people's experience in the Pacific Northwest. All videotape was digitized at MIPoPS, in collaboration with partnering institutions (the University of Washington Libraries, Ethnomusicology Archives' Vi Hilbert Collection and the Seattle Municipal Archives' Seattle Channel collection), thanks to funding from NEH, NHPRC, and 4Culture grants. Selections include: Vi Hilbert (Upper Skagit Tribal Elder) presenting stories and songs from "Sharing Legends at Upper Skagit", a Lushootseed language and storytelling program; and excerpts from the documentary, "Bernie Whitebear: A Modern Warrior". To conclude, we will share two clips that are unrelated, but that are some fan favorites from Moving History (MIPoPS' quarterly screening night series) - two comedic PSAs created and animated by the Seattle Fire Department, featuring Big Red - the talking fire hydrant!</Abstract>

This has allowed us to redefine our outreach strategies which involve in-creased social media presence, forging new partnerships with local media outlets, improved planning and execution for community events, as well as tapping into our creativity to reach new users. In this presentation, we will outline the key components of our new marketing strategy and methods of monitoring success. We will provide example excerpts from Moving History (our quarterly screening night series) highlighting ways we've incorporated art and music to engage new users with archival video material. A community discussion will follow to provide support and resources to institutions with similar needs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From small regional archives to large academic institutions, portable recording formats such as compact cassettes and DV tapes abound in oral history and field recording collections. As such, they are a crucial element in the preservation of community voices and heritage. Since these formats are universally subject to the risk of "degralescence," a dual threat of physical deterioration and loss of playback equipment, it is paramount to create the truest digital proxy possible when any reformatting is undertaken. This talk will dive deep into the underlying technologies and methods involved in the reformatting of these items, touching on topics such as playback head demagnetization, the provenance metadata contained within DV videos, and reformatting tools (both existing and under development). Attendees will come away with an enhanced understanding of open resources and techniques involved in making the digital preservation of these items both optimal and attainable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The fact that the essays that make up the Hamburg Dramaturgy originally appeared in serial form has inspired us to consider how our project of translating and annotating the work might engage a 21st-century Anglophone readership in an analogous way.  We have negotiated an arrangement with Routledge Press that allows us to make use of an innovative, web-based "blog" process of public peer-review and commentary on the translation and annotations, and that grants us rights to a persistent online version of the project in that form.  Beginning in fall 2012, we began publishing the individual essays online as they were finalized.  We had two primary purposes for using digital methodologies for this project: 1) we wanted to make the translation widely available to students and scholars as quickly as possible, and 2) we wished to engage the worldwide community of Lessing scholars and theatre historians in "crowdsourcing" the most up-to-date research and understanding of the work while the translation is in progress.  The response to our invitation to the world of scholars and Lessing enthusiasts to weigh in on our work-in-progress has, however, not been particularly robust, and we seek to share this experiment in open, online peer review with other members of the Working Group so that we can reflect on both the advantages and challenges posed by the use of digital methodologies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation provides evidence for Level Ordering in Tetso?´t'ine´, using evidence from three dimensions of phonological variation across levels: tone association, foot-medial consonant deletion, and stress-tone interactions. This work shows that morphologically complex languages can have more levels than are usually assumed, which actually confirms the key idea behind Stratal OT--that levels are motivated by both phonology and morphology. We conclude that Stratal OT provides both a principled account of phonological opacity, as well as a restrictive theory of the phonology-morphology interface.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1909, the U.S Supreme Court, echoing the typical reasoning of earlier U.S. and British legal rulings regarding the distribution of media goods, held that a copyright holder's distribution rights for any single copy of a media good are exhausted upon the first sale of that copy. Later codified as "The First Sale Doctrine," this legal principle severely limited the ability of publishers and other content owners to control how the media goods they sold in the United States were priced, distributed, and consumed.   This paper argues that the First Sale Doctrine has been the legal bedrock for two key features of twentieth-century media distribution in the U.S.: the retail store and what is usually called the secondary (ie. used) market. In enabling these institutions, the Doctrine has provided consumers broader and cheaper access to media goods while also fostering new forms of entrepreneurial activity and participatory culture. Drawing from legal cases, congressional hearings, and trade articles, this paper also demonstrates and accounts for the Doctrine's surprising resilience throughout the twentieth century, during which time it had been the object of numerous attempts by American media companies to undermine or dismantle it. The paper concludes with an analysis of the Doctrine's continued meaning and validity during the twenty-first century, particularly with respect to new digital distribution systems and restrictive Terms of Service licenses.  Though the paper's main emphasis is U.S. copyright law and distribution systems, brief comparative reference will also be made to Europe's slightly different approach to the same legal issue.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past fifteen years, there has been an explosion of immigration policy-making at the state level, with some states taking an anti-immigrant stance while others support immigrant integration.  What explains this variation?  In this project, we focus on Arizona and New Mexico, which provide ideal comparative cases for study because of their many similarities.  Located in the southwest desert region of the United States, they share a common geographical history.  They were, to a large extent, part of the same jurisdictional territory in the mid-1800s, and they attained statehood the same year (1912).  Both states border Mexico, as well as each other.  Yet New Mexico and Arizona have taken widely divergent paths in the realm of immigration enforcement and immigrant integration over the past decade.  Their differences reflect the patchwork of approaches that has developed across the country, with these states representing the far ends of the spectrum:  a harsh, anti-immigrant enforcement-oriented model in Arizona, and a pro-immigrant incorporation model in New Mexico.  We hypothesize that these divergent approaches have roots deeply anchored in the racial political economies of these states, stretching from the territorial period (mid-1800s to 1910) to statehood (1912), and into the present.  In this paper, we focus specifically on the Chicano Movement (1962-1975), which we argue is a critical juncture for the development of contemporary immigration politics in both states.  Despite the Chicano Movement's shared inspirations and aspirations across the Southwest, each state's racial and political history shaped the Movement in important and specific ways, leading to widely divergent outcomes.  Our analysis suggests that every political movement is local, indelibly shaped by its socio-political environment, and that local conditions shape and constrain social movements in important ways.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This poster investigates vowel length in Tetsot'ine. It is argued that stem vowels are specified underlyingly as having either one or two moras (as part of the full ~ reduced vowel contrast, inherited from Proto-Dene), while prefix vowels have zero moras--that is, they do not contrast in length. This hypothesis is called "Systematic Underspecification". When combined with level ordering, this hypothesis explains nearly all of the observed vowel length alternations in prefixes. Specifically, long vowels in prefixes take at least two cycles to derive: a vowel acquires a mora on the first cycle, and then a consequent subsequently deletes on a later cycle, leaving behind a long vowel. On the other hand, if a vowel coalesces with another vowel immediately on the same cycle at which it is added, a short vowel will result, since the new vowel had zero moras in the input, and thus does not add any new vowel length.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Guillaume Du Fay's Nuper rosarum flores has been ground zero for symbolic interpretation in musicology ever since Charles Warren suggested that the structure of the motet reflects the architectural proportions of the cathedral of Florence. More recent analyses have continued to begin from the premise that the motet's form has extramusical significance—in particular, that mensural and architectural proportions can be directly analogized. And of course the very text of the motet makes clear that Du Fay wrote this music in conjunction with the 1436 dedication of Santa Maria del Fiore, possibly even for performance as part of the elaborate consecration rite. These tantalizing connections have caused scholars to canonize this motet, which has become a mainstay of music history textbooks. Indeed the extent and specificity of the extramusical associations Nuper rosarum flores enjoys—an occasion, place, patron, even an unquestioned attribution—is rare in the fifteenth century. This in itself makes the piece seem special.  This wealth of information makes it hard to read Nuper rosarum flores in any context other than the consecration ceremony. Nevertheless, it is just one of many motets Du Fay composed for specific occasions. In this paper I return to first principles, reading Nuper rosarum flores against the norms of genre and notation and against the grain of the work's modern historiography. I suggest that it is not all that special—or, at least, that it is no more special than Du Fay's other ceremonial motets. This, in turn, leads me to ask what Nuper rosarum flores and pieces like it can tell us about text, form, and notation, and about how fifteenth-century music constructs meaning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay aspires to conceptualize and historicize the use of photography for peace-building. I begin by posing some basic structuring questions: Are there specific genres of photography focused on peacebuilding and conflict transformation? If so, what are their properties and characteristics? Under what conditions did this photographic practice emerge: what were the essential political, institutional or international preconditions? When, that is, did the contemporary concern to foster transitional justice emerge as an "optic" – allowing groups to mobilize photography to invoke human rights claims against domestic oppressors, prosecute crimes of perpetrators, shape successor governments, and seek to heal post-conflict societies?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We moderns conceive of rhythm in terms of note shapes that contain stable numbers of beats, but in the 14th and early 15th centuries rhythm was conceptually based in the flexible and context-dependent symbols of the mensural system. The modern notion that rhythm is rooted in absolute durations has no real equivalent in late-medieval thought. Instead theorists talked about rhythm exclusively using the names for note shapes, which were meaningless when taken out of context. For late-medieval thinkers rhythm was inseparable from notation.  This paper asks: what would it be like to inhabit a musical world in which rhythm's very essence was contextual, with each note gaining meaning from a governing mensuration sign and the note shapes around it? I address this question with reference to pieces hitherto considered "isorhythmic," in which melodic and rhythmic repetitions proceed in tandem. In motets such as Egidius de Pusiex's Ida capillorum/Portio nature, tenors that are notated only once must be read in different mensurations and diminished. These transformations are indicated exclusively by means of a verbal instruction to the performer. Indeed in this period tenors governed by these instructions are never provided with written-out resolutions. All of this raises an intriguing possibility: that a late-medieval singer might have understood these four renditions to be essentially the same, even though he would have known them to sound very different. This alternative notion of rhythmic "sameness" grounded in notation stands to reform current thinking about the repetition and transformation of motet tenors, a practice that stretches from the start of the ars nova through Du Fay's Nuper rosarum flores and sets the stage for the masses of the following century.</Abstract>

This alternative notion of rhythmic "sameness" grounded in notation stands to reform current thinking about the repetition and transformation of motet tenors, a practice that stretches from the start of the ars nova through Du Fay's Nuper rosarum flores and sets the stage for the masses of the following century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Guillaume Du Fay's Nuper rosarum flores has been ground zero for symbolic interpretation in musicology ever since Charles Warren suggested that the structure of the motet reflects the architectural proportions of the cathedral of Florence. More recent analyses have continued to begin from the premise that the motet's form has extramusical significance—in particular, that mensural and architectural proportions can be directly analogized. And of course the very text of the motet makes clear that Du Fay wrote this music in conjunction with the 1436 dedication of Santa Maria del Fiore, possibly even for performance as part of the elaborate consecration rite. These tantalizing connections have caused scholars to canonize the motet, which has become a mainstay of music-history textbooks. Indeed the extent and specificity of the extramusical associations Nuper rosarum flores enjoys—an occasion, place, patron, even an unquestioned attribution—is rare in the fifteenth-century. This itself makes the piece seem special.   With this wealth of information it can be hard to see Nuper rosarum flores in any context except the consecration ceremony, but it remains just one of many motets Du Fay wrote for specific occasions. In this paper I return to first principles, reading Nuper rosarum flores against the norms of genre and notation and against the grain of the work's modern historiography, concluding that it isn't all that special—or at least no more special than Du Fay's other ceremonial motets. This, in turn, leads me to ask what Nuper rosarum flores and works like it can tell us about text, form, and notation, and about how fifteenth-century music constructs meaning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The only surviving source for the Missa Gross senen transmits the tenor in both canonic and resolved versions. The resolutions fit with the non-canonic voices, but don't clearly derive from the canonic tenor. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, I propose a reading of the canonic notation that is unorthodox but theoretically grounded. In a period when augmentation was new and subject to different interpretations, it is no surprise that composers found diverse solutions. Viewing this mass's notation as still coalescing invites us to reflect on the nature of augmentation and, by extension, the relationship between notation and musical ideas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines pro-war and anti-counter culture songs of the 1960s. Cultural memory of the Vietnam War era has ignored these songs. Examining these songs reveals the grievance and confusion and hostility that was generated by opposition to the war, a position that ultimately was exploited politically by Richard Nixon. These songs show the beginnings of a divide that continues to torment American politics and culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the transnational and transracial ties that linked French-language writers from Quebec, the Caribbean, and Africa from the mid 1950s to the mid 1970s. This period, during which independence was an essential concern in Africa and the Caribbean as well as in Quebec, nurtured solidarities defined by leftist politics and serious considerations of interregional, interracial, and interclass difference. The "tongue ties" of the paper's title has a double meaning: while francophone anticolonial intellectuals were "tied" linguistically through their use of the French tongue, their connection was also constricted (tied) by the inherent qualities of a language itself shaped by varied francophone histories and cultures. Language was fashioned by and simultaneously fashioned these solidarities. Specifically, my paper will lay the groundwork for an examination of the ways texts worked with and through language in this period, arguing that the linguistic tropes that authors used to express unity in difference reveal both gaps and unexpected connections in the francophone political imaginary. The analytical abecedary of these tropes constitutes a "poetics of solidarity" that defines a foundational moment in French-language world literature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>(This presentation was drawn from an article I wrote for The Philosopher's Magazine)       In this century, many meaningful and fulfilling jobs will be made obsolete by artificial intelligence, specifically, by machine learning.  Some predict that this will eventually lead to a post-work heaven of leisure, while others predict a hellish state of poverty and boredom.  It's thus worth thinking through a few questions: 1.) in the coming few decades, what sorts of jobs might be destroyed by machine learning, and what sorts might endure, and might be created?  2.) to remain employed, how might we prepare for this?  and 3.) how will these shifts affect how we find meaning in our work?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As part of two government grant projects, surveys of California world history teachers in 2002 and 2015 found that teachers skip the mandatory units on Islam.  As an undergraduate in 1995 it was obvious to me that Islam is important in the world and in the U.S., while it remains a low priority in our education system.  Scholars in the AAR such as Fred Denny, Michael Sells, and John Esposito have published excellent introductory texts that do not filter down to the training of history teachers.  There is a demonstrated need as evidenced by Pew Forum findings that prejudice against Islam is steady or increasing and the rate of hate crimes has not dropped back to pre-9-11 levels.   Since 2009 faculty in the U.S. are encountering students with lower real wages and rising expenses alongside cultural obstacles of underprepared students.  In addition, scholars of Islam find themselves working in an increasingly politicized environment.  There is ideological pressure to join neo-imperial or post-colonial camps or to promote neoliberal or religious nationalist worldviews.   This chapter presents the three leading efforts in the Americas to move beyond these binaries.  Leaders in Montreal, Quebec, Bogota, Colombia, and Boston, Massachusetts (Programme Éthique et culture religieuse, Programa de Competencias Ciudadanas, and Harvard Religious Literacy Project, respectively) have identified that in the 21st century religious literacy is an essential part of citizenship education.  One no longer needs to fly to Ankara, Turkey, like Annemarie Schimmel in 1954, to learn about Muslim cultures.  Muslims are already our neighbors, co-workers, and classmates.  Democracy and civil society may require Humanities scholars to unify in support of effective religious literacy education.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Public health was crucial to the success of the American pacification campaign and the "civilizing process" in the Philippines during the early twentieth century. In 1905, American colonial officials established a leper colony in Culion, southwest of Manila. To safeguard public health, officials deemed it necessary to forcibly remove "lepers" from their homes; however, in 1907, citing limited resources and the difficulty of pregnancy for women with leprosy, they banned cohabitation and marriage within Culion. Colonial officials had downplayed Filipino leprosy patients' opposition to the segregation order. But how did female patients respond to the segregation policy? How did they engage with authorities over such issues as the ban on cohabitation and marriage?  This paper advances our understanding of the engagement between Filipino women leprosy patients and colonial officials. This is an understudied theme in literature on empire, medicine, and public health, and U.S. colonialism in the Philippines. Very few studies of Culion address patients' – mostly men – oppositional views and practices. I argue that female patients, individually and collectively, asserted their sense of self and in so doing, rejected the notion of women as weak, mere followers of the male patients and wards of the nuns and the state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Spanish poet Gerardo Diego became reknown during his lifetime for his "classic" style, notably the incomparable sonnet "El ciprés de Silos," which generations of schoolchildren in Spain learned to recite from memory. Such classic poetry, led in great part to Diego's induction into the Real Academic Española as well as his receiving the Premio Cervantes in 1979. Before the Spanish Civil War, however, and among students of his work, Diego has also been known as a key figure in the Spanish avant-garde in relation to poetry; his volumes Imagen (1922) and Manual de espumas (1924) set the pace for the poetic vanguard in 1920s Spain, especially the Ultraísmo and Creacionismo movements.  Given both Diego's level of recognition and his achievement as poet, it remains surprising that another crucial aspect of his work has remained largely unexplored: the engagement with popular poetry and music. Moreover, Diego's fascination with popular and traditional poetry from the inception of his career augurs the stylization of popular and traditional forms—in the classic or avant-garde mode—which would become characteristic not only of his work, but also that of such Generation of 1927 figures as Rafael Alberti and Federico García Lorca. This paper centers on Diego's adoption of the at once popular and traditional romance form, from the time of his first poetry volume, El romancero de la novia (pub. 1920), to the various transformations of the romance that he incorporated into many of his subsequent volumes. It also explores the unique characteristics of Diego's romances in contrast with salient Generation of 1927 texts like Lorca's Romancero gitano (1928). For, as I argue, the adaptation of popular and traditional forms played a significant part in twentieth-century Spanish poetry, as well as a special role in the development of the Spanish avant-garde and its peculiar identity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When we think of the Spanish poet Gerardo Diego (1896-1987), what frequently comes to mind is the "classic" sonnet "El ciprés de Silos" or, perhaps, such avant-garde volumes as Imagen (1922) and Manual de espumas (1924). It may then come as a surprise that there existed another side to Diego—one which privileged and celebrated popular poetry and music. Unlike his fellow members of the Generation of 1927 Federico García Lorca and Rafael Alberti, Diego's interest in the popular has stayed largely unrecognized. Yet Diego was not only a proud son of his city of birth, Santander, but also, he remained a life-long student of Cantabrian culture and an accomplished concert-level pianist who perfectly understood the region´s musico-poetic production.   From his first poetry volume, Romancero la novia. Iniciales (1917; pub. 1920), to such mature works as Alondra de verdad (1941), Canciones a Violante (1959), Mi Santander, mi cuna, mi palabra (1961), and Sonetos a Violante (1962), Diego has given voice to the music and poetry of Cantabria. At the same time, Diego´s style should not be considered "folkloric"; rather, he articulates Cantabrian culture by mixing avant-garde and popular form. This paper will focus on how Cantabria's peculiar musico-poetic culture finds expression in Mi Santander, mi cuna, mi palabra, and the way in which Diego transforms and stylizes such music and poetry so that it acquires an abstract and markedly vanguard form, thus combining the popular and avant-garde in an idiosyncratic fashion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From Gerardo Diego's first poetry volume, Romancero la novia. Iniciales (1917; pub. 1920), to such mature works as Alondra de verdad (1941), the Canciones and Sonetos a Violante (1959; 1962), and Santander, mi cuna, mi palabra (1961), the poetry collection dedicated to his city of birth, Diego gives voice to the music and poetry of Cantabria. At the same time, Diego does not in general represent Cantabrian culture directly, nor should his style be considered "folkloric." Rather, he articulates Cantabrian culture, and the music and poetry that emerges from this culture, through abstraction and the avant-garde style that constitutes yet another important aspect of his work, from the time of the volumes Imagen (1922) and Manual de espumas (1924), which were inspired by the first Spanish vanguard movements Ultraísmo and Creacionismo, to the mature and highly idiosyncratic Poemas adrede - Fábula de Equis y Zeda (1932; 1943). This paper will focus on how Cantabria's peculiar musico-poetic culture finds expression in Diego and, in particular, the way in which he transforms and stylizes such music and poetry so that it acquires an abstract and often markedly vanguard form, thus combining the popular and the avant-garde in a unique and surprising fashion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper offers a comparative analysis of early modern historical and fictional figures who dressed in disguise. The principal narrative stems from a Spanish legal case from 1693-1694, El fiscal de su Majestad contra José Soller, peregrino mulato, por fingirse sacerdote y otros delitos. My talk will compare Soller's story and mode of disguise with those of other historical figures such as Catalina de Erauso, the monja alférez, and Martín Garatuza, also a priest impersonator, as well as fictional characters such as the morisco Ricote in the second part of Don Quijote.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Session proposal: Growing Community: "The Asparagus Capital of the Nation"  This session focuses on the history of migrant labor in Oceana County, Michigan – one of the state's most diverse agricultural counties, widely known as "The Asparagus Capital of the Nation." Papers presented as part of this session will assess what has been uncovered as a result of a two-year long effort, supported in part by a NEH Common Heritage Grant, to digitize oral histories, photographs, scrapbooks, and related materials from families who have made their homes in that area. Those materials include those who have settled in the area as well as those who continue to migrate seasonally, and their employers. In this way, the session engages with the larger conference theme that explores the history of commodity production and consumption across borders, focusing particularly on the United States and Latin America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The goal of session is to provide attendees with a brief overview of the "Growing Community in Oceana County" project, a public history initiative that was launched in January 2016 with support from a National Endowment for the Humanities Common Heritage Grant. This project aims to create a digital public archive documenting the agricultural history of Oceana County.  Known as "The Asparagus Capital of the Nation," the history of Oceana County and its people sheds light on not only regional identities, but also highlights local effects of federal and international policies including North American Free Trade Agreement, War on Drugs, immigration, and deportation, among others.   Panelists will provide reflections on what they see as the primary value of the work as well as the questions it raises. The participants represent a variety of gazes, academic and nonacademic, as well as disciplinary perspectives. The goal is to engage audience members in a dynamic conversation about the interdisciplinary and social justice challenges of agriculturally focused, collaborative, public history projects.  Dr. Andrew Schlewitz, assistant director of Latin American Studies and a consultant on the "Growing Community" project, will chair and moderate the session.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Architecture in the Roman Empire was essential for generating and shaping collective memories of cities, events, and people. But how does stationary architecture—and the complex messages it conveys—translate into a collective memory shared across space? I investigate how buildings could project desired images of cities and regions, establishing a collective memory of those sites—for example, of Puteoli as a city uniquely favored by Rome's emperors. I demonstrate how souvenir representations of architecture enabled this projected image to become collective memory not only locally but also around the empire. Finally, I argue that souvenirs of structures illuminate Roman notions of architecture and urban space. My approach draws on close visual and archaeological analysis and on neuro-cognitive studies of how visual imagery shapes memory. I also consider the cognitive science of how conversation and social interactions—precisely what the Roman souvenirs were designed to prompt—generate shared memories. Ultimately, to understand fully how architecture created memory and knowledge in an era before mechanical reproduction and digital technologies, we must look closely at buildings and their portable representations in tandem.</Abstract>

Ultimately, to understand fully how architecture created memory and knowledge in an era before mechanical reproduction and digital technologies, we must look closely at buildings and their portable representations in tandem.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ancient Romans had a rich if underappreciated tradition of souvenirs associated with religious experience. This paper examines two categories of religious souvenirs that transcended the boundaries of sanctuaries. The first category I term prospective souvenirs: objects commissioned for use before a visit to a sanctuary and then deposited there as votives. The second I call retrospective souvenirs: mementoes purchased during a visit to a sanctuary and then brought home for display. Both prospective and retrospective religious souvenirs generated narratives of religious experience that transcended the temporal limitations of visits to sanctuaries and that became integrated into daily life, on roads or in cities. Cognitive research about prospective memory, collaborative remembering, and semantic memory illuminates the agency of souvenirs to shape collective memories and knowledge of religious sites and rituals. Religious souvenirs are, therefore, critical to understanding how religious experience and sites were materialized, remembered, and conceptualized in cities and on roads far removed from classical sanctuaries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Defending Language Security: Letters from the Dakota, 1862-1865" will provide a description of the English translation of first-person narratives of those Dakota people writing in their own language during the mid-nineteenth century. The time period selected for this presentation encompasses the years of most drastic change for Dakota people—treaty negotiations, land loss, war, imprisonment, and exile. The selected letters provide insights into the lives of prominent and ordinary Dakota people held in prison in Minnesota and Iowa after the war with the United States in 1862, their opinions about their relationships with the federal government, and their attempts to negotiate the rapid changes brought on by Christianity, war, and exile.  A Dakota perspective—observations of the world written in their own words in their own language—will challenge accepted representations of their issues and concerns as written by missionaries and historians. This presentation will begin with a short general introduction that provides historical and interpretive information including explanations of events and historical figures relevant to an understanding of the importance of the letters and how they came to be written. The process of translating these letters and researching the historical context will be described in order to demonstrate their importance in preserving the Dakota language, both historically and in the present day, as well as highlighting the impact of prison conditions and eventual release on the context of their letters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In traditional Tunisian healing practices, one of the most common diagnoses is affliction by water spirits (ba?riyya). A wide variety of ritual healing musics feature songs dedicated to these water spirits, as well as the saints, such as Sidi Bu Sa‘id el-Baji, who are believed to control them. The praise song (nuba) for Sidi Bu Sa‘id called ra'is el-ab?ar (captain of the seas) is found in numerous healing and devotional musics, providing a shared reference for musics associated with a diversity of communities, including healing traditions of women (such as the mannubiyya), the Jewish community (rebaybiyya), and even drinking parties of laborers (mizwid). In this paper, I examine this song in relation to the cultural "work" of the silsila ("chain"), a flexible musical form that provides a sonic inventory of the saints of the local devotional landscape. In doing so, I explore the Jewish-Muslim convergences that defined the rebaybiyya tradition, the trans-Mediterranean (Tunis-Paris) traffic in musicians that nurtured it, and the faint traces of those collaborations and movements that remain in the Tunisian devotional musical landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Can musical form reflect, or even encourage, particular ethical stances? This paper approaches this question through a consideration of the devotional and healing rituals held at the shrines of Sayyda Mannubiyya in Tunisia, which have been high-profile targets of militant Islamist vandalism and threats in recent years. The women's trance healing ritual is based on a musical form called the silsila (lit. "chain"), a flexible succession of songs dedicated to different saints in the local devotional landscape. The silsila references the "home" traditions of these different saints, including those of Sufi orders that may have competing claims about the appropriateness of music and trance, while also bringing these disparate traditions into the distinctive soundworld of the Mannubiyya. Sayyda Mannubiyya is also unique in the local context as the only female saint to have inspired a men's devotional ritual. Male members of the Shadhuliyya Sufi order perform their liturgy immediately following the women's trance ceremony. The men's liturgy revolves around the dhikr (chanted repetitions of religious formulas), which has ritual objectives, aesthetics, and priorities that, at first glance, seem to stand in opposition to those of the women. Yet ethnographic and musical analysis reveals fissures that complicate binaries of male/female or dhikr/silsila to show how they each constitute a devotional niche within a shared ecology of saint-based ritual practices and espouse distinct yet complementary ethical work at the individual and community levels.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Women, black, and Jewish North Africans all co-participate in a musical and spiritual "commons" in which they co-participate in an ecology of saints and a system of devotion and healing that ascribes a song to each of those saints. They share a musical form called the silsila (chain), which is flexible and encourages borrowing. But each one also reveals the distinguishing characteristics of each ritual community: the women's silsila highlights women saints and the role of motherhood; the black Tunisian silsila highlights its history of trans-Saharan movements of people, spirits, and musical aesthetics; the Jewish silsila avoids mention of the Prophet but connects to ritually adjacent practices. This talk shows how music performs the work of integrating women and minorities into a shared spiritual ecology while simultaneously asserting each community's unique identity and ritual priorities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Much attention has focused on how academic museums employ object-based learning to make curricular use of collections that engage faculty and students. But how do academic museums develop intellectual points of access to collections that make these curricular connections possible?  This session will focus on how strategic planning, project development, and federal grant writing can foster greater access to collections and provide students invaluable experimental learning opportunities.  The Logan Museum of Anthropology has a successful track record of securing federal grants to facilitate collections preservation and access. The museum is currently implementing a National Endowment for the Humanities funded project focused on digitizing and cataloging a collection of textiles from Oaxaca, Mexico. Ms. Meister will speak to how the museum used strategic planning and project development to position itself to be "grant ready" and how infusing student opportunities in grant proposals can strengthen project significance and relevance.  Ms. Jenkinson will discuss the project's implementation and how to strike a balance between project objectives and meaningful experiential learning opportunities for students. By modeling best practices in project design and implementation this project can serve as an example of how these methods can engender positive student outcomes: critical thinking, problem-solving, confidence, and the ability to work independently.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The clothing weavers of the state of Oaxaca in Mexico create highly decorated "huipil" tunics, which generally consist of multiple geometric patterns woven together. As with many cultures that enjoy such designs, all 7 strip symmetry groups appear in the collection of huipils we investigated, but some strip patterns were substantially rarer than others. There appear to be weaving reasons for some of the difference in frequencies. One strip pattern, pmm2, essentially only appears on the shoulder bands of these tunics, and may be related to a desire for a 3-dimensional "front-to-back" symmetry imposed upon the symmetries that appear in a more "standard" Oaxaca design. A surprisingly large number of variations of strip symmetries appear in these huipil, including 3-color and 4-color symmetry; combinations of adjacent strips with varying symmetries; and deliberate symmetry breaking. One huipil gives the impression of a weaver consciously playing with, or experimenting with, glide reflections. We will look at this collection of huipil tunics as an example of the interaction between geometric art and the cultural standards of the Oaxaca weavers</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper looks at a 1950s conflict between market researchers Alfred Politz and Ernest Dichter as more than a methodological squabble in the behavioral sciences: it was a paradigmatic conflict over the possibility of subjective choice as a fundamental principle of democracy.  Dichter professed to use the psychoanalytic method to expose the "true" basis of consumers' motivations, but his fellow market researchers distrusted the scientific rigor of his method, and contemporary writers attacked his brand motivational research as a threat to the autonomy of American consumers who had become vulnerable to manipulation by a mysterious group of "depth probers."  For Politz, what people believed on a conscious level, or even what they desired on an unconscious level, was not getting to the truth in market research; for him, what was true was how consumers would behave in a marketplace situation.  The truth could be arrived at through the scientific design of the survey, calibrated to judge the likelihood of behaviors and actions, not the depth of attitudes.  Although it occurred within the provincial world of consumer market research, this conflict had profound implications for the concept of the individual as an autonomous agent in a commercial-democratic society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper considers how two key works of contemporary black women's visual culture, Issa Rae's HBO comedy, Insecure (2016-), and Ava DuVernay's OWN drama, Queen Sugar (2016-), represent black class privilege as embodied crisis, shaped by gender and sexuality. Using a critical black feminist lens, I consider how these popular works, both part of the emergent renaissance in African American television, grapple with the state of life-or-death emergency that is black American life in our immediate present moment. These works, particularly Duvernay's drama, Queen Sugar, delve into this sense of crisis even as they speak to nuances of black middle class experience that would initially seem to distance their characters from blackness's most immediate dangers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This presentation is centered in the U.S. tour of the Algerian theater troupe Istijmam in the fall of 2016. The troupe presented the play Apples, written in the early 1990s by the esteemed Algerian playwright Abdelkader Alloula three years before he was assassinated by Islamist insurgents during Algeria's bloody Dark Decade of civil war (1992-2000). I focus on how the actors shaped their bodies into artistic media. I consider how they brought together three theatrical lineages, putting the Algerian tradition known as halqa in dialogue with the theories and practices of Brecht and Grotowski. While the body is perhaps the oldest medium, this paper shows how it is made new in theatrical performance.  Video examples accompany the presentation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Theater practitioners and performance studies scholars have historically shared the project of putting aspects of culture on display for reflexive critique. In this paper, I consider the problem of translation of theatrical works for international consumption. I ask how the Algerian play "Apples," written by Abdelkader Alloula in 1993, was translated for performance in the US in 2016 by the Algerian troupe Istijmam. While the script posed issues in linguistic translation, the genre conventions and cultural dimensions proved more challenging. The play sets Algerian storytelling practices in relation to Brechtian techniques of epic theater, both of which forego linear development and feature actors moving among a range of roles. Such techniques, largely executed through the body, are intended to create distance between text, actors, and spectators that allow for cultural critique – a process Brecht called distantiation or alienation.  How did this Algero-Brechtian project resonate with audiences in the United States?  How was the apple, a luxury import in Algeria that symbolized the country's failed opening to neoliberal democracy, made intelligible in the US, where apples are available in every corner market? How did the embodied techniques of distantiation used by the actors serve both to translate and to critically stand apart from the theatrical work? By examining the US performances of Apples, I explore new intersections between ethnography and theater, asking whether and how theatrical critique translates when it travels. As part of the translation and coaching team, I also position myself between ethnographic and theatrical work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Most accounts of the Columbian voyages and the Age of Encounters describe Europeans' initial confusion of America with Asia: a confusion that quickly gave way to the realization that America was a New World. According to this way of thinking, such confusion—for instance, the idea that Jamaica might be Java, or that Tenochtitlan might be Quinsay—has been seen as a momentary, if not quaint, misunderstanding. A wide variety of evidence however demonstrates that learned Europeans continued to represent the Americas as Asia up to and beyond 1600. Mercator, for instance, labeled the central valley of Mexico as "India" in his influential 1569 atlas, and the French explorer Jean Nicolet believed that when he and his fellow mariners crossed Lake Michigan in 1634, they would be greeted by the Great Khan of China on the other side. This paper will focus in particular on a 1558 world map by Casper Vopel, a map that depicted Asia and America as the same continent, and Cathay and Mexico as the same province. Ideas about "Amerasia" so regularly inhabited the minds of early modern Europeans; this paper will use Vopel's map to explore how Amerasia functioned, culturally and intellectually and the claims it made; namely, how it served the needs of European imperialism, as well as how it it offered explanations about the universal and shared origins of humanity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Field studies have had the effect of bringing modern cultural categories into the world of early modern European collecting and anthropology.  The New World objects collected by, say, the Habsburgs or the Medici, are studied by Americanists, whereas the Asian objects in those collections are studied by specialists in those fields. Yet in the collections the objects mingled, and so did their provenances. New World objects were often called "indiane" or "dell'India;" almost never were they called American. Artifacts from New Spain were regularly studied in the context of knowledge about Egypt and Asia. As late as 1665, one Mesoamerican manuscript, the Cospi Codex, was inscribed "Libro della China" (and not long thereafter was corrected to "Libro del Messico," signaling, perhaps, the advent of a new era of designation). Rather than see these incidents as mistakes or confusions to be cleared up, this paper attempts to inhabit the Amerasian extension imagined by Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as a coherent if flexible system.  What would it mean to look at the Cospi Codex and think of it as Chinese? What did their China look like?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>War in the Pacific: Difficult Heritage recently engaged veterans, veteran families, and WWII survivors on the Pacific island of Saipan in considering how conflict heritage can be seen as universal to humanity and how it can be used to examine the veteran's experience. The starting point for this consideration was to focus on the historical and contemporary warrior/veteran's experiences as it relates to collective human experience of war and how we might come to understand and interpret the heritage created through past conflicts as shared, collective heritage. The project trained local community members to lead discussion focused on the Spanish-Chamorro Wars of the 17th century and the WWII Battle of Saipan, as bookends to the history of resistance and aggressions in the Mariana Islands. A multi-vocal approach was used to explore and discuss terrestrial and underwater heritage, film, memoirs, children's literature, poetry, and graphic novels on the subject of war.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>War in the Pacific: Difficult Heritage, a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project of East Carolina University in partnership with the Northern Marianas Humanities Council and the Saipan Historic Preservation Office, engages veterans of contemporary wars, surviving civilian participants of WWII, and families of military service personnel in considering how difficult heritage can be seen as universal to humanity and how it can be used to examine the veteran's experience and even heal and renew. The starting point for this consideration is to focus on the historical and contemporary warrior/veteran's experience as it relates to our collective human experience of war and how we might come to understand and interpret the heritage created through conflicts as shared, collective heritage.   This process is accomplished through the development of a program that train local Saipanese community members with experience and interest in humanities, history and veteran affairs to be discussion leaders who will conduct humanities discussion groups with local, primarily Chamorro and Carolinian, veterans. The wars chosen are the Spanish-Chamorro Wars of the 17th century and the WWII Battle of Saipan as bookends to the history of resistance and aggressions in the islands. Together these wars were chosen because they represent the complexities of all of the participants of war, combatant and non-combatant, in a colonial and post-colonial context. Through the exploration of terrestrial and underwater cultural heritage, film, history, memoirs, children's historical fiction, poetry, painting and graphic novels, a focus on multi-vocality will be critical to understanding the meanings of war from different perspectives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Ambient Rhetoric, Thomas Rickert offers a New Materialist approach to rhetoric and theorizes that rhetorical networks distribute agency between material and human actors. Rickert's work not only gives material objects a new importance in rhetorical situations, but it also challenges the subject/object divide in traditional rhetoric. Although New Materialist approaches to rhetoric are a relatively new development in Western thought (Rickert's text was published in 2013), the underlying principles have been operating in Byzantine Christian religious visual rhetoric for well over a thousand years. This presentation argues that the rhetorics of display that developed around Byzantine religious icons both challenge and reinforce traditional Western subject/object binaries and complicate our understand of ambient rhetoric.  When displayed in cathedrals, Byzantine icons exemplify ambient rhetoric by inviting viewers into an interactive space that breaks down the both subject/object and material/spiritual barriers. I use Sicily's twelfth-century Monreale Cathedral as a case study that demonstrates how icons surround the faithful with a great cloud of witnesses – a supernatural network – that they could experience with all five senses. This liminal space allows for a destabilizing reversal of the subject/object divide: icon viewers become a part of the images and are themselves transformed into religious subjects. As Kaufmann points out, however, contemporary experiences of religious sites are in no way equivalent to Byzantine experiences. Today, Monreale Cathedral is as much a tourist destination as a church. This presentation additionally considers how the frameworks of capitalism and tourism complicate both subject/object binaries and the notion of ambient rhetoric.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Marco Island Historical Museum is a non-profit organization with the goal of preserving the history and heritage of Marco Island and the surrounding area. The museum opened in 2011, with funds raised by the Marco Island Historical Society. The Marco Island Historical Society received a grant to catalog and curate the artifacts which had been both excavated and donated to the museum by Marco Island residents. Previously, these artifacts were housed in boxes and bags that would not aid in preservation. It was the responsibility of interns to catalog the artifacts and switch them over to museum grade storage materials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this essay, I examine the prominent place held by the writings, thought, missionary work, and overall personality of Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf, the founder of the Pietist Moravian Church, in American religious and literary culture of the nineteenth century—decades after his death in 1760. Specifically, the widely popular poet, activist, and educator Lydia Howard Huntley Sigourney credited Zinzendorf for her pacifist convictions and stance against Indian removal. The preface to her eponymous poem "Zinzendorff" reveals a "personal intercourse with that sect of Christians" (5). This essay thus hopes to reveal, via Sigourney's characterization of Zinzendorf, that German Pietism enjoyed a remarkable purchase among Anglo-phone Americans long after German religious immigrants first sought to establish the precepts of radical German Protestantism throughout the North American colonies. Although both the Moravians and Sigourney have enjoyed a modicum of interest in late 20th and early 21st century scholarship, their stories still appear as outliers in a literary and cultural history and consciousness dominated by the Edwards-to-Emerson narrative.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using Randall Kenan's 1989 novel A Visitation of Spirits as a fulcrum, "Quaring Childhood" aims to bring several fields that have developed substantially in the past two decades—childhood studies, critical race studies, queer theory, and new southern studies—into dialogue. In her influential 2009 study, The Queer Child, Kathryn Bond Stockton asserts that all children are "thoroughly, shockingly queer," a claim, as Michael Bibler has recently outlined ("Queer/Quare"), with many parallels in critical evaluations of the U.S. South. Responding to what he sees as a willful blindness toward race, class and ethnicity in queer theory, E. Patrick Johnson borrowed from the southern vernacular to advocate for a "quare studies" that accounts for tangible, material bodies as they are situated in local (regional, racialized, religious) practices of everyday life. "Quaring Childhood," puts the precepts of Johnson's "quare" in conversation with Stockton's theory of the "publicly impossible" "ghostly gay child" as a way of exploring Kenan's transformation of the southern gothic to address exclusionary discourses of community, region and nation in his tale of 16-year-old Horace Cross's struggle to reconcile his emergent "queer" sexuality with his experience of southern Baptist Christianity. In ways that supplement and complicate Stockton's queer theory, Kenan deploys gothic tropes of the monstrous, haunted and doppelganger South to assert the need for transformation, not of his gay African American protagonist, but of the "nation" that has formed and rejected him. Horace is, as Johnson would say, an instance of "theory in the flesh," and if Horace's flesh is graphically destroyed at the end of A Visitation of Spirits, I demonstrate, its implications resonate for the region and nation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With over 1100 distinct languages, the Pacific is one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world. At the same time, many of the materials written in or about those languages are difficult to locate in the world's libraries. This is because until recently libraries have lacked standards for accurately cataloging their collections according to the name of the language or dialect. This means that resources on or in languages of the Pacific have remained somewhat hidden from library users, including researchers and the public. In this presentation, we describe a three-year collaborative project between the University of Hawai'i at Ma¯noa (UHM) Library?s Pacific Collection and Department of Linguistics, in which we have been actively working to accurately describe the over 10,000 items in or about Pacific languages held in the UHM Pacific Collection. This project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, seeks to make discoverable a critical part of the Pacific social and cultural environment, as well as set a new standard for language description to ensure that Pacific voices are heard.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In April of 1969, Rabbi James Rudin wrote a report to Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, executive director of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), about a meeting with Clyde Ferguson, President Nixon's personal representative for responding to the Nigeria-Biafra war. Things were not going well in Biafra; the nightly relief flights were being shut down, and the option for a relief corridor through Nigeria did not look likely to get approval. Biafrans were dying, not just from starvation but attendant diseases like tuberculosis.  This paper explores how American Jews positioned themselves as part of the debate over Biafra, including their work in responding to what the Biafrans and others described as genocide. The claim was controversial, however, and many African and African American intellectuals felt that the division of Nigeria, so recently independent, was a travesty. The paper examine show American Jews were positioned as part of the global pro-Biafra movement. It considers not only the politics of Holocaust memory as it played out in the wake of Biafra, but also how American Jewish organizations (led by the AJC) took up the Biafran cause in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.  I ask how Biafra figured among the constellation of political causes that were of interest to American Jews from 1967 to 1970, including Vietnam, Israel, and anti-apartheid. I argue that Jews responded to the Biafran cause both because they saw resonances with Jewish history and because they saw in Biafra an opportunity for relatively non-controversial ecumenical cooperation.  At a time when Jews were at the heart of the liberal and left-wing coalitions against apartheid and the US war in Vietnam, and were also increasingly identifying with Israel in the wake of the 1967 war, Biafran relief was a non-political politics clothed in ecumenism, one that served well for a group still uncertain about its own whiteness, and its rapidly evolving status as an ethnic-religious minority.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper focuses on not state-strategies of colonial urban development, but on creative responses to it. Specifically, it examines how a group of middle-class clerks and civil servants reconceptualized and shaped Sekondi, a small port city that housed the first railway terminus of the West African colony of the Gold Coast. Using regular columns that appeared in an African-owned newspaper, I unearth how educated migrants from various parts of the Gold Coast, West Africa, and the Atlantic World "rebuilt" the city through musical and social activities. In the process, I challenge urban history's conviction that "real" city-building is a material process predominately driven by the state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historical maps are important resources for various kinds of studies, providing insights for natural science and social science studies such as biology, landscape changes, and history [1]. However, text recognition on maps remains a challenging task because map usually has a complex background in which textual content appears in numerous colors, fonts, sizes, and orientations. Even if we were able to acquire perfectly recognized words and characters automatically, it is still difficult to generate useful information because individual words are not meaningful. For example, a typical result from OCR scanning or manual map digitization is that each recognized bounding box only contains a single word (Figure 1).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Rev. J. G. Wood notes, in his popular book Common Objects of the Microscope (London, 1861), "Many seeds can be well examined when mounted in Canada balsam, the manner of performing which task is simple enough, and yet is often very perplexing to a beginner. Very little apparatus is required. … The great di?culty in mounting objects in Canada balsam is to keep them free from air bubbles; but by proceeding in the following manner, very little di?culty will be found."  In this passage, ostensibly about examining seeds, Wood is actually remarking upon one of the most commonly used substances of the microscopist's practice, Canada balsam. This is a turpentine made from the sap of (as the name suggests) the balsam ?r tree of Canada. It was used for mounting microscopic slides and for rendering microscopic objects transparent because pure dry Canada balsam has a very high refractive index, similar to crown glass.Wood's book is founded on this quintessential paradox of nineteenth-century microscopy, its juxtaposition of popular access and elite skill.  Canada Balsam is an ideal lens through which to examine microscopy's (and Wood's) mashup of ease and di?culty, man of the street and of the laboratory. This substance acts not only as glue and preservative but as an actual lens as well: Wood, speaking to a broad audience, does not scorn "those penny microscopes, composed of a pill-box and a drop of Canada balsam, which are hawked about the streets by the ingenious and deserving manufacturer."  While this familiar unguent was also a crucial ingredient in a popular cough syrup and in the almost mythical "Balm of Gilead," Canada Balsam was perhaps most valuable as a export to microscopists: this "common object" of Canada thus preserving the "common objects" -- and the rare ones, too -- of England.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Microscopical Society of London was founded in 1839 to promote microscopical science, achieving chartered status as the Royal Microscopical Society in 1866. In 1865, the Quekett Microscopical Club was founded as an amateur alternative ("club") to the RMS. But the divide was blurry: the membership overlapped, and Quekett meetings often consisted of outings and comic songs as well as informative sessions.  If the RMS and Quekett circulated microscopy through their meetings, both also did so by publishing journals. The Transactions of the Microscopical Society of London appeared in 1844, replacing an earlier journal. A reader's suggestion in Harkwicke's Science Gossip, taken up by M. C. Cooke, sparked the Quekett, whose Journal of Microscopy began in 1868.  The title of "circulating microscopy" best belongs to the Postal Microscopical Club, educating provincial microscopists from 1873. The PMS not only produced a journal but its members met virtually, via postal circulation of microscopic slides along various "circuits."  This paper examines the status of the amateur microscopist circulating in mid-Victorian science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Detailed knowledge of the natural and human-induced changes on Earth is crucial to understand human activities at the local, regional and global levels across the scale of time. Yet, the data sources that can provide such knowledge over a broad temporal or spatial scale are dispersed and not in a readily usable format for data analytic tasks. At the Spatial Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, we are building novel map processing technologies to unlock detailed geographic information from maps. Our open source software, Strabo, "reads" scanned maps for automatically identifying historical locations of places. Our recent collaboration with a title insurance company in the United Kingdom illustrates the significance of this work. Using Strabo, the insurance company is automatically reading historical Ordnance Survey maps (circa 1900 – 1970) covering the entire U.K. to identify likely locations of subterranean contamination, such as factories, mines, quarries, and gas works, which no longer exist and which otherwise would not be known today.  In 2016, we were awarded by the National Science Foundation for a three-year project to build spatially and temporally linked geographic datasets from all editions of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) historical topographic maps. This NSF project will develop an approach and software that automatically transform the geographic information in thousands of historical maps to machine-understandable datasets. With such large-scale datasets, researchers in biology, cancer and environmental epidemiology and social sciences will have unique opportunities for answering important questions in studies that require long-term geographic data analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historical spatiotemporal datasets are important for a variety of studies such as cancer and environmental epidemiology, urbanization, and landscape ecology. However, existing data sources typically contain only contemporary datasets. Historical maps hold a great deal of detailed geographic information at various times in the past. Yet, finding relevant maps is difficult and the map content are not machine readable. I envision a map processing, modeling, linking, and publishing framework that allows querying historical map collections as a unified and structured spatiotemporal source in which individual geographic phenomena (extracted from maps) are modeled with semantic descriptions and linked to other data sources (e.g., DBpedia). This framework will make it possible to efficiently study historical spatiotemporal datasets on a large scale. Realizing such a framework poses significant research challenges in multiple fields in computer science including digital map processing, data integration, and the Semantic Web technologies, and other disciplines such as spatial, earth, social, and health sciences. Tackling these challenges will not only advance research in computer science but also present a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With this contribution, I discuss how the notion of structural balance in networks can contribute to a greater understanding of the circulation of knowledge and ideas between Catholic Tuscany and the Calvinist Dutch Republic. It questions how scholars between these two opposite societies could maintain a balance between, on the other hand, the desire to circulate knowledge, and on the other, the need to avoid tensions. These tensions ranged from restrictions imposed by the Sant'Uffizio, to scholarly rivalries, jealously and competition. Drawing on insights from Social Network Analysis, this paper explores how structural balance can be used to reason about how fissures in an epistolary network may arise from the dynamics of conflicts, disagreement and antagonism between corresponding scholars. The notion of structural balance offers to capture positive and negative links to understand the tensions between these two forces, which either enables or blocks the flow of information throughout the early modern network.   In the context of EMDA2017, with the help of visiting faculty member Sebastian Ahnert, an algorithm was developed to assess the applicability of the structural balance theory in historical research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The aftermath of Hurricane Camille, which struck Mississippi, Louisiana, and Virginia in 1969, was a key moment in the broadening of federal responsibility for disaster victims, and can be rightly understood as an expansion of the Great Society public social safety net. At the same time, the policy shifts that unfolded after Camille also broadened the range of voluntary disaster relief organizations that would become highly visible components of post-disaster landscapes. Driving both transformations was the increasingly contested role of the American National Red Cross (ANRC), a non-governmental organization to which Congress had delegated disaster relief for individuals in the early 20th century. Following Camille, critiques of racial discrimination by local ANRC units in Mississippi led to calls for national, public provision; while at the same time, critics derided the organization's bureaucratic and insensitive relationship with disaster victims and obtained official recognition of faith-based groups such as the Salvation Army and Mennonite Disaster Relief.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Wellcome Library manuscript MS 7113 epitomizes the promise of working with recipe books to reconstruct early modern social networks. Owned by Lady Anne Fanshawe and later inherited by her daughter, MS 7113 shows the effects of marriages, politics, and social upheavals on early modern domestic life, and its yet-unstudied marginal notations and recipes written in English and Spanish bear the influence of Lady Anne's travels to France, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. As these notations often indicate who donated recipes to the household and as particular dishes such as "seviche" and "Spanish Bacon" specify recipe and ingredient location, MS 7113 hints at both the social networks within which the Fanshawes operated as well as the way English households engaged with foreign cookery and medicine.   This presentation will trace intersections between Lady Anne's travels and recipe collecting habits while also demonstrating how today's collaborative methods are bringing to light the networks that created early modern manuscript recipe collections. Taking MS 7113 as our model, we will also show how collaborations like The Early Modern Recipes Online Collective and the Herbal History Research Network allow scholars from disparate campuses to map similarly long-distance relationships that influence domestic practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In September, 1882, a piece of fiction entitled "Madame de Sade" appeared on the front pages of Le Figaro. In the story, the young writer Valérie Milotte is sentenced to three months in prison and a fine of two thousand francs because of her salacious publications.   When Marc de Montifaud read "Madame de Sade" in the daily paper, she was livid. At the time, there was only one woman in France who had been relentlessly pursued by the court system for salacious writing, and that woman was her. She felt she had no choice but to take the matter into her own hands, literally: she slapped Magnard across the face with his own newspaper at the premiere of the Comédie Francaise. She was in a tailcoat and pants at the time, because—as she noted in her account—having taken on the custom of wearing men's clothing a few years prior, she always wore the appropriate attire for the occasion.My talk will consider this episode as a unique vantage point for considering Marc de Montifaud as a nineteenth-century "gender outlaw"—to take up Kate Bornstein's notion, which designates someone whose very identity troubles social structures, even when they have no desire to rebel or flout the law. Montifaud did not fit into the available categories for understanding challenges to gender norms in her time. As a result, she worked to make sense of herself by drawing on historical figures who had similarly defied social expectations. By considering the role of gender in her self-defense, my paper will attempt to make sense of the disconnect between Montifaud's own proud self-image, inscribed in French history and tradition, and the scandalous reputation thrust upon her, which imagined her as a threat to those very forces.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This symposium brought together seventeen scholars from a variety of ranks, disciplines and countries doing groundbreaking work on the subject of impersonation/guising/embodiment in modern and early modern South Asia. The expected outcome of the symposium is an edited volume on Impersonation in South Asia, which will be the first scholarly source to examine impersonation both in contemporary performative and quotidian contexts across South Asia. We understand impersonation as the temporary assumption of an identity or guise of a group that is not one's own in social and aesthetic performative contexts, including the same as expressed in literature. Pamela Lothspeich organized the symposium and delivered a paper, "The Affective Work of Performing Divinity in the Theatre of Ramlila."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper considers how the figure of "motiveless" crime appeared in the work of certain mid-century southern writers, and in the work of non-southern writers interested in the racial violence of the Jim Crow south. In the staging of "true crime" stories by writers as diversely oriented as Gwendolyn Brooks, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Richard Wright, and Flannery O'Connor, we see a shared interest in capturing a kind of "criminal evidence" not admissible, or relevant, in the courts: the kind of psychological material that made coherent motive finally impossible to identify, thus asserting literature as an important form of "evidence" in its own right. This paper suggests that such depictions dramatize anxieties regarding punishment and justice in the context of an un-Constitutional regime, as well as concerns regarding the perceived threat of totalitarianism more broadly and paradoxes inherent to the figure of the abstracted individual posed by certain mid-century "procedural" liberalisms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Holt v. United States (1910), Justice Holmes established a formal distinction between the evidence of the voice and the evidence of the body, marking the Supreme Court's adoption of the Fifth Amendment as a privilege regarding testimonial evidence only. But by the 1950s, developments in police procedure, crossed with due process decisions of the Warren Court, provoked new deliberations on doctrinally held Cartesian distinctions between the mind and the body: that is, between registers according to which a legal person may be taken by the police as a voluntary source of their own "evidence." In Rochin v California (1952), Justices Black and Douglas extended the privilege of the Fifth Amendment by invoking the bodily boundaries implied by the Fourth, to include: "words taken from his lips, capsules taken from his stomach, blood taken from his veins." But 13 years later, in Schmerber v. California (1966), Justice Brennan would again limit the scope of the Fifth Amendment protection to "testimonial evidence," explicitly excluding all forms of "physical" evidence from the protection against self-incrimination: blood, fingerprints, voice and handwriting samples, and standing in a line-up. The decision split the Court 5-4, with each dissent (including that of Chief Justice Warren) citing due process concerns raised by allowing the forcible extraction of evidence from the body as excluded from the right to protection from self-incrimination.  This paper considers the stakes of such juridical distinctions in the context of how American writers dramatized resonant relations of power between the state and the individual throughout a period that put intense pressure on the limits of police power and the integrity of the body: that of de jure and de facto racial segregation. Texts to be considered include Richard Wright's The Man Who Lived Underground (1941), William Faulkner's Requiem for a Nun (1950), and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>New England's Hidden Histories, a project of the Congregational Library in Boston, seeks to identify, secure digitize, transcribe, and post online New England's most valuable early manuscript church records. We believe these documents cast more light on life and culture in early New England than any other discrete set of sources. This presentation discusses the birth and growth of our project, and the many ways in which scholars and the public will find value in these records.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this presentation I will present the early, NEH-funded prototype of a digital map of pre- and post-contact American Indian tribal and national regions, cultural histories, and tribally submitted and approved data that is non-archaeological in nature.  The prototype, upon completion, will consist of a national map with general information and dynamic details related to three indigenous nations: the Osage, Modoc, and the consolidated Pomo/Miwok.  This map will be available to scholars and the public, and envisions future collaboration with, and a centralized reference site for, existing indigenous maps and digital sites. We intend in this project to connect the study of humanities (specifically, indigenous histories and cultures) to conditions of social and cultural life by enabling the public, around the world, to access current and historical maps, cultural practices, and other data related to the life of indigenous peoples.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this presentation, I will invite commentary and suggestions for the construction of a collaborative digital resource, "Mapping Indigenous American Cultures and Living Histories," funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The primacy of Indigenous voices in constructing such resources is emphasized in the existing structure of the project.  In addition to presenting the digital map, I invite discussion on such issues as, how do we avoid the Western cartographic bias in mapmaking?  How can Mukurtu assist in creating culturally sensitive digital resources?  How can collaboration be achieved in a single resource when private and sacred materials and knowledge sets are involved?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At nearly every concert of Javanese gamelan music outside of Indonesia, there is a good chance that someone in the audience will want to know the answer to the following question: "What were they singing about just now?" And there is just as good a chance that no one present will be able to answer, because 1) the musicians themselves are unlikely to know fully what the words mean, and 2) the lyrics are extremely heterogeneous and include many lines that do not carry any propositional meaning (the first part of a riddle or of a rhymed couplet, for instance), such that a full answer to that question would take many hours to explain. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the texts in much traditional Javanese gamelan music, it is often impossible to summarize the meaning of the texts in a single piece, let alone in an entire concert. This leads to the following questions: is there an "about" in the lyrics of Javanese gamelan music, and, if not, what function might the lyrics play in gamelan performance?  After analyzing the different relations between words and music in various musical and literary genres in Javanese vocal music (which, to be sure, includes genres in which the music can be said to express the words, and the words are about something), I consider whether a distinctively Javanese way of incorporating poetry into music--which predominates in traditional gendhings (gamelan pieces)--isn't partly responsible for a decline in the popularity of traditional gamelan music in Java. That is, with mass-mediated popular music dominating the airwaves in Indonesia, listeners come to expect fairly straightforward, relatable lyrics that not only are about something, but are expressed in the music, as well. Yet, could it be that the more enigmatic, fragmentary, "aboutless" way of using texts in gamelan music could be seen as partaking of a postmodern aesthetic, and hence could help give it a newfound cachet?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digital humanities brings unique challenges and opportunities to "keeping data alive" that are leading to innovative cross- disciplinary solutions. Data preservation involves standards, guidelines, open-source vs. proprietary software, accessibility, and much more. While establishing best practices, cultivating a community of experts, and developing infrastructure for 3D data used in cultural heritage has been the focus of several coordinated efforts in Europe over the past decade, efforts have been less systematic in the United States. Recently, however, digital humanities practitioners have spearheaded 3D data preservation and sharing in the United States.   While humanities scholarship uses many types of 3D models, the case study focuses on 3D models of ancient Maya architecture generated from multiple data sources including architectural drawings, excavation reports, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and airborne LiDAR. To contribute to 3D data preservation efforts, while maintaining realistic goals, the MayaCityBuilder Project focuses on procedural modeling—rapid prototyping of 3D models from a set of rules. Procedural modeling is ideally suited for the development of 3D modeling standards that promote data interoperability, dissemination, and reuse because they bring with them the underlying metadata, paradata (information about modeling choices), and descriptive data.   We present an overview of the workflows we are developing to serve our objective of data reuse and more broadly access and preservation of 3D data. Additionally, we discuss how these workflows relate to the next phase of the project, i.e., prototype development. The prototype will take advantage of recent developments in web technology, namely the adoption of WebGL that renders interactive 2D and 3D computer graphics in browsers without plugins.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We are proposing a showcase that will present the findings of a NEH Digital Humanities Advancement grant-funded workshop, to take place in Spring 2018.  This workshop will bring together editors and technical experts currently engaged with or interested in two open-source content management systems—Omeka and Drupal—to explore how the platforms are currently being used at projects and the editorial and publication needs that drove each project's development as well as projects that are considering digital publication and/or technical solutions, review the project requirements, and compile a list of must have features and functionalities.  The showcase will consist of posters* and two computers.  Two of the posters will present "What is Drupal" and "What is Omeka," focusing on how both platforms can be used for editorial work and publication; additional posters will illustrate use cases: the Jane Addams Papers Project, the George Washington Financial Papers Project, and others (ie. Martin Van Buren Papers project, Civil War Governors of Kentucky, Howard Thurman Papers Project). Hajo and Stertzer (and other participating project directors) will be on hand to discuss the platforms and findings as well as solicit feedback and ideas for additional options and future development work.  There will also be two computers available for digital demonstrations of both platforms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The American Prison Writing Archive (APWA) is a digital platform for non-fiction essays by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside.  It seeks to disaggregate this population into singular minds and ideas. Narratives of the human costs of incarceration enable and invite humanists—with their highly nuanced methods of critical reading—to help counter the ‘big data' approach to carceral statehood with an unfolding of big narrative witness. In the 2,500,000+-word APWA, academic commitment to both professional scholarship and public activism can join in a project that removes scholars from the roles of leading voices and into the work of secondary witnesses facilitating the labor of the organic intellects now burgeoning at the receiving end of law's violence.  This capacity will be put into (preliminary) practice in real time among audience members.   The paper will begin with a five-minute PowerPoint history of the analog inception and into-digital growth of the APWA. It will then lead the audience through the basic search facets of the archive, asking readers to focus on essays by incarcerated women of color (nb: i-phones are adequate for this work).  After a few minutes given to reading among these essays, the session will enter open discussion of what readers have found; stepping off from this discussion, the presenter will conclude by suggesting ways to curate and make critical use of prison witness more generally.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although no Caribbean country has a Muslim majority population, Islam has been an important presence for at least five centuries. The major conduits of Islam in the region were labor schemes: African slavery and Indian indenture. At the same time, Islam's Caribbean journeys included explorers and emigrants who hailed from diverse societies and cultures around the globe, and who have been devotees of varying schools of Islamic thought. Scholarship on Caribbean Islam and Muslims typically has emphasized either Africans or Indians, although also acknowledging the heterogeneous practitioners and practices that define them. These complexities have important implications for the ways that racial and religious identities are characterized with regard to Caribbean Muslims. Based on my forthcoming book, my presentation considers the ways that "African" and "Indian" racial identities in the Caribbean are constituted through their historical intersection with ideas about religion and religious identities. I argue that this nexus—the racialization of religion and religionization of race—is key to understanding the hierarchies of human "types" that inform the perception and the practice of Islam in the colonial and post-independence eras. My discussion will draw from the Caribbean cultural phenomenon known as "Hosay," the region's local version of the Islamic mourning ritual, Muharram.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While many digital asset management platforms and digital libraries exist, most have been designed for technically savvy users and not the older adults who are a key audience for our Digital Drawer platform. In the domain of digital humanities collections, our project is significant in that we are utilizing a participatory design (PD) process wherein all of the stakeholders and potential users of a system are actively involved in the design process to help insure the result meets their needs and is usable. This paper presents a case study on the PD process and the challenges of designing a crowd-sourced media and metadata submission tool for the Historic Rural Churches of Georgia to accommodate older adult users with low technical savvy and disabilities. We report on the PD process to design the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) for this user demographic, present conclusions and plans for future work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk outlines the progress and problems of a three-year-old project to build an extensive, open, digital collection for studying the structure of nineteenth-century knowledge, based on historic editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Today, we readily recognize a pervasive Eurocentrism in these entries, among other flaws. But at the time, the Britannica editions were the most authoritative comprehensive representation in the English-speaking world of knowledge as a whole. Knowledge has changed since that time, and it changed during the publication of this material, from 1790-1911. This data set documents those changes. The goal of this project is identify patterns in the transformation of knowledge by mining the final data set. All of these works are available on the web, but their textual data is too inaccurate for valid text mining. This project thus creates the first accurate TEI edition of this valuable resource. The full corpus consists of 100,000 articles derived from 80,000 print pages. The TEI will be supplemented with metadata using Named Entity Recognition. The Metadata Research Center at Drexel University will further enrich the data by adding subject metadata from both current and historical vocabularies, using an automated recognition program they developed. When complete, all individual entries will be made freely available through the Oxford Text Archive. It will be uploaded for other researchers in bulk form to the CORE Repository of the Humanities Commons.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Komuz" is a Nilo-Saharan (N-S) language family first proposed by Bender (1989, 1991) based on Greenberg's (1963) initial subgrouping of Koman and Gumuz languages within the N-S phylum.  Bender 1989 originally proposed that Gumuz and Koman had a distant relationship within the same subfamily labeled "Komuz", but he later recanted (1997, 2000) stating these two groups had "no special relationship" (2000: 56).   Since then, others have maintained that these two groups do indeed show special relationship to each other (save Dimmendaal 2011), offering competing classifications which disagree as to a) whether these two are part of the greater N-S phylum and b) where they might fit within the phylum; Ehret (2001), Blench (personal communication), and Ahland (2013) maintain its N-S membership while Dimmendaal (2008, 2011) casts some doubt on its membership, stating that "very few of the more widespread nominal and verbal morphological markers of Nilo-Saharan are attested in the Coman languages plus Gumuz" (2008: 843). More recently, Dimmendaal et al. tentatively have placed Koman and Gumuz as an outlier branch in an N-S tree (forthcoming) even though Dimmendaal had previously listed Koman as an "independent family" and Gumuz as an "isolate" (2011: 408). All of these classifications differ greatly from each other as well as from Bender's 1991 Komuz proposal.   In this paper, I present evidence further supporting a Komuz subgroup within N-S and explore evidence for establishing a distant relationship with the Eastern Sudanic subfamily, which together form the "Core" subgroup of N-S as Bender had initially proposed. New evidence from the previously unknown language Daats'i´in further supports this proposal. Similarities between a possible Komuz family and Eastern Sudanic are assessed in terms of whether there is evidence for shared retentions versus shared innovations, keeping in mind areal patterns and borrowing as possible explanations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Coptic is the last stage of the Egyptian language. Before Coptic, Ancient Egyptian was written in Hieroglyphs, Hieratic, and Demotic scripts. Starting in the third century CE (excluding "Old Coptic"), Coptic used an alphabet based on the Greek and several added Demotic letters. A large but understudied corpus of literary texts exists in Coptic, including important Gnostic, monastic and Manichaean texts, as well as early Biblical translations. Efforts to build a digital Coptic corpus are still in their initial phases. In this paper, we present the most recent work in a partnership of Digital Humanities projects. Coptic SCRIPTORIUM (Schroeder and Zeldes, 2016) is a major initiative endeavoring to put corpora online which are linguistically and philologically annotated (i.e. supporting grammatical, paleographical and literary annotations), while projects in Göttingen are producing digital editions of Coptic texts focusing on philological standards and critical editions: A project at the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities is preparing a complete digital edition of the Coptic Old Testament (Behlmer and Feder, 2017), and in a project of Collaborative Research Centre 1136 "Education and Religion" digital diplomatic editions of selected works of Shenoute and Besa, 4th-5th century abbots of the White Monastery in Upper Egypt, are being prepared for text reuse research. Based on our experiences, we have schematized workflows for building Coptic corpora with linguistic and literary information by using open source programs, merging data from OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and transcription sources, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, and manual annotation interfaces allowing for the correction of automatic tool output.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents a novel approach to the segmentation of orthographic word forms in contemporary Hebrew, focusing purely on splitting without carrying out morphological analysis or disambiguation. Casting the analysis task as character-wise binary classification and using adjacent character and wordbased lexicon-lookup features, this approach achieves over 98% accuracy on the benchmark SPMRL shared task data for Hebrew, and 97% accuracy on a new out of domain Wikipedia dataset, an improvement of ˜4% and 5% over previous state of the art performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents the Coptic Universal Dependency Treebank, the first dependency treebank within the Egyptian subfamily of the Afro-Asiatic languages. We discuss the composition of the corpus, challenges in adapting the UD annotation scheme to existing conventions for annotating Coptic, and evaluate inter-annotator agreement on UD annotation for the language. Some specific constructions are taken as a starting point for discussing several more general UD annotation guidelines, in particular for appositions, ambiguous passivization, incorporation and object-doubling.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Paper for a seminar on scrapbooks and Shakespeare at the 2018 Shakespeare Association conference. The paper discussed the work of the Philadelphia Playbills Project in relation to the Furness Shakespeare Libary collection of scrapbooks, comparing the way people of the past collected playbills, actor images, and more and pasted them together in scrapbooks to document a performance they had seen, with the virtual "scrapbooking" at work in connecting the playbills data produced in the project with images of theatrical ephemera in the Penn Libraries collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper looks at famed chemist (or chymist) Robert Boyle's Origin of Forms and Qualities and considers an un-named target of Boyle: William Harvey. Boyle published Origin of Forms and Qualities in 1666 as an attempt to eliminate reliance on Aristotelian forms, promoting instead his own corpuscular philosophy. In "The Historical Part" of Origin of Forms and Qualities, Boyle provides examples and experiments historically understood as involving substantial change, which he attempts to describe in terms of quality-less, uniform corpuscles.  His very first example involves the hatching of an egg, or the development of a chick from diaphanous fluid. This paper argues that Boyle's use of this example —from his introduction of it, to his description of how the egg develops, to his concluding remarks regarding the explanatory power of Harvey's "plastick principle"— is a direct response to. Harvey had communicated his own views on the generation of chick eggs some fifteen years prior in Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium.  A detailed analysis of his reply to Harvey can allow us to understand not only Boyle's own account of animal generation but his methodical commitments more generally. Harvey holds that proper explanation lies in an account of the four Aristotelian causes, and his description of the plastic principle within the chick-egg is closely tied to his account of those causes. Boyle, however, rejects this approach and places the explanatory focus upon the material effects and modes of operations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the nineteenth century, the Ottoman state took punitive steps against bureaucrats who failed to meet the new standards of efficiency. Bureaucrats who neglected their duties were fined, demoted, transferred, suspended, and even dismissed. This paper explores the changing perceptions of productivity and efficiency in the Ottoman bureaucracy. By focusing on the bureaucratic offices of the period, I aim to shed light on the role of social practice in this emergent culture of productivity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper investigates the historical development of writing on morality as form of social intervention in the late Ottoman society (1870s-1920). Ottoman moralists, composed of lowbrow public intellectuals (mid-rank bureaucrats, school instructors, doctors, and military men) took upon themselves an entrepreneurial role in guiding their nation to "progress," both morally and materially. Between the 1870s and 1910s, they published more than a hundred morality books as well as numerous articles and sermons in periodicals, dramatically changing not only the format but also the content of this longstanding genre on many levels. They codified an ethic that is focused on right behavior, right emotions, and civic duties. Thus, Ottoman moralists were involved in shaping the emerging civic culture through their normativized and popularized narratives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The varied intersections of war and worldwide temperance activism in the early 20th century provide unique contexts for analysis at both national and international scales. Though categorized commonly as part of an "Islamic world"—and thus omitted from many would-be global histories of alcohol, the Ottoman Empire included many sites and situations meriting consideration.  Though Ottoman leaders pronounced firm proscriptions during the war for its military, it often relied on religious and moral arguments when offering justification for prohibition. Following WWI, added rationale emerged from both state and society.  Proposed, debated, and passed in 1920, the Turkish republic's prohibition only lasted until 1924, when the costs of the experiment were more evident and once Kemalists consolidated their authority.  By exploring this transitional period, we can discern that the ban was not just the product of an odd internal coalition between conservatives and socio-medical reformers; it shared profound connections to ongoing temperance narratives and activism observable at the global scale, particularly in the US.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a Poster at the Digital Heritage Conference:  The Digital Lab Notebook (DLN) project is an open source software tool chain that simplifies scientific imaging. The DLN's user-friendly tools collect scientific metadata during information capture and processing, essential for building reliable and reusable "digital surrogates" of our cultural heritage. Then the DLN organizes these reusable digital representations and their data into standards-based Submission Information Packages (SIPs) for archival delivery and intake.   The tools are for use by cultural heritage practitioners in scholarly disciplines, museums, libraries, and historic sites, as well as by local citizen scientists and caretakers around the world. Software internationalization and an initial translation into Arabic will foster the DLN's adoption. The goal is to help save humanity's imperiled cultural legacy through the widespread democratization of documentary technology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scale (which encompasses time, space, and causation) has become the most relevant topic in 21st century historiography. And while most historians think intensely about scale (namely, how to deal with it themselves), they have only recently (with a few exceptions, of course) started to both historicize and theorize the very term that divides the profession, its subfields, and its methodologies. Many historians—while confronting the Anthropocene—are calling for "global" histories, "deeper" histories, and "bigger" histories (to use the adjectives that are being employed in new course titles, including my own). But many others are rightfully skeptical, for how much nuance is lost (how much violence is done) as we amalgamate the particularities of the human experience into sweeping narratives that can account for global phenomena like Climate Change.  I would like to suggest that animals may provide one solution to the problem of Scale. Seeing animals as subjects in the past, and looking for their lives, biographies, cultures, and particularities can help us tie together the "scale gaps" that divide historiography. Furthermore, seeing animals can help us enact a more ecological vision.   In particular, this paper will think about historical scales by following fish through the Great Lakes. It will reinvigorate ecological niche theory for the purpose of placing fish and humans into history, or more precisely, into different, yet overlapping, histories, calibrated to different scalar visions. This paper will suggest that niche models may be useful in 1.) finding "agencies" in, around, and between animal collectivities without anthropomorphizing or essentializing any single individual, 2.) conceptualizing various scales together, and 3.) fusing animal history with historical ecology in a manner that foregrounds both human and nonhuman subjects at the same time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Shortly after the Civil War ended, the zoo movement, alongside other urban cultural movements, swept the United States, both in the North and the South. The history of American zoos, of course, have much to say about the history of conservation, animal history, historical ecology, the history of science and medicine, and evolutionary history as they, in turn, inform histories of nation-building, urbanization, and empire. Zoos, though, can also tell (bio)political stories. While zoogoers themselves rarely encountered politics along zoo footpaths, in the halls of Congress the ties that bound the National Zoo and its animals to politics proved more visible, especially when the topic of the zoo exploded into years of intense sectional debate in the House of Representatives. The National Zoological Park, as the only zoo in American history whose governance fell under the purview of the federal legislature, offers a unique window into a semiology that fused animals to debates about government that divided a nation through and after the Civil War. Animals were used by Congressmen to conjure sectional ideologies that could not be wielded as aggressively in an era of reconciliation. Using methods derived from animal studies, this essay will call attention to the sectionalism of the National Zoo.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This work will entail an examination of Folger sources including manuscript travel diaries and letters, such as Henry Belasyse's "A voyage or journey from London into France" (Folger G.a.5), as well as rare examples of expense reports, travel licenses, and passports like the one signed by Elizabeth I for Thomas Knevet of Norfolk (Folger Z.c.24 (23)), and ars apodemica (art of travel) treatises such as Sir Thomas Palmer's 1606 treatise, An essay of the meanes hovv to make our trauailes (Folger STC 19156). These sources will help to paint a broad and informative picture of travel for both men and women in the period, and to situate women's travel in relation to a larger discourse of travel in the early modern period, a discourse in which women's travel was not often deemed necessary or even desirable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This poster will focus on best practices for creating experiential education partnerships, modeled on the efforts of Texas Woman's University to connect with Dallas/Fort Worth-area organizations for the NEH-funded project "Building Global Perspectives in the Humanities." This project aligns with LEAP Essential Learning Outcomes and Principles of Excellence to create an opportunity for students to go global without going abroad by incorporating experiential learning into global perspectives courses. The presenters will help attendees imagine how to launch their own such partnerships, focusing on four key stages: evaluating institutional and student needs, identifying prospective partners, communicating stakeholder contributions and benefits, and establishing institutional agreements. Discussion will focus on inclusivity, since the primary goal of this project is to increase access to global learning. Because many students find traditional education abroad programs time and cost prohibitive, the facilitators will focus on leveraging local resources to create global experiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper argues for a reconceptualization of early-nineteenthcentury federalism that augments the familiar federal-state dichotomy with a third zone: concurrent authority. As commentators struggled to make sense of the nation's expanding markets, transportation networks, and territory, they developed a view of concurrent power as a zone of governmental authority analytically distinct from national or state power. It was a domain of overlapping, authority requiring constant negotiation. In a line of cases concerning people moving on waterways, the Court explicitly undertook to draw a line between federal and state regulation of commerce: Gibbons v. Ogden (1824, steamboats); Mayor of New York v. Miln (1837, passenger lists); the Passenger Cases (1849, passenger taxes) and Cooley v. Board of Wardens (1852, piloting fees).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Early-nineteenth-century Americans were consumed by conflicts over concurrent power – areas in which the Constitution had left the line between federal and state authority unclear, and in which states had a colorable claim to autonomous power.    Many of these lawyers and statecrafters took a much more favorable view of concurrent power than modern scholars have acknowledged.    This paper argues for a reconceptualization of early-nineteenth-century federalism that augments the familiar federal-state dichotomy with a third zone: concurrent authority.  As commentators struggled to make sense of the nation's expanding markets, transportation networks, and territory, they developed a view of concurrent power as a zone of governmental authority analytically distinct from national or state power.  It was a domain of overlapping, authority requiring constant negotiation.  In a line of cases that all concerned people moving on waterways, the Court explicitly undertook to draw a line between federal and state regulation of commerce: Gibbons v. Ogden (1824, steamboats); Mayor of New York v. Miln (1837, passenger lists); the Passenger Cases (1849, passenger taxes) and Cooley v. Board of Wardens (1852, piloting fees).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Commerce was the key constitutional frame through which early-nineteenth-century Americans understood their rapidly changing landscape.  During this period, the United States developed into a federal, commercial republic.  Local activities in one state were understood potentially to "affect other States," as Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in Gibbons v. Ogden (1824).  But another powerful strand of constitutional thought resisted this expansive notion of federal commerce.  This imperative was an unsettled but deep commitment to concurrent power.  States clearly had the power to regulate some forms of commerce under their traditional police powers.  Between 1801 and 1835, the Marshall Court confronted a series of prominent cases that required it to define the federal power to regulate commerce.  These controversies concerned diverse areas of activity, including the use of the waterways; the importation of foreign goods; and the status of free black sailors in southern ports.  All these cases concerned crossings of borders, whether by vessels, goods, or people.  Which sovereign could govern those vessels, goods, and people when they crossed those borders was the central issue connecting this disparate array of cases.  Yet the text of the Constitution provided no clear answer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Way of the Poet-King (Kavirajamarga?), composed around 870, has a strong claim to be the earliest Kannada text to survive in manuscript form, and arguable did more than any other text to establish this "regional language" of South India as a literary idiom more or less on par with Sanskrit. The Way can be characterized, fairly, as a product of the Imperial Ra??raku?a court, as a transcreation of an important work of poetics in Sanskrit, namely Da??in's Mirror of Poetry (Kavyadarsa), and as a watershed moment in the history of Kannada literature. Our talk will take another look at these three aspects of the Way, but we will emphasize the "twos" that make each of them more complex: its two authors (Srivijaya and Nr?patu?ga), the two works of poetics that served as its primary models (Da??in's Mirror and Bhamaha's Ornament), and the two languages whose relationship to each other is one of the text's primary concerns (Sanskrit and Kannada).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What makes a poetic fault a fault? Inversely, what makes a poetic virtue a virtue? What are the different frameworks of assessment internal to a language that determine such good and bad qualities? When Sanskrit and vernacular languages came into contact, how were these different linguistic frameworks negotiated? As is clear from Sheldon Pollock's work, S´ri¯vijaya's ninth-century Kavira¯jama¯rgam?, the first extant text to theorize the Kannada language, is an ideal case study for thinking about the relationship Sanskrit and vernacular languages, in this case Kannada. However, beyond the larger meta-theoretical point about vernacularization, much work remains to be done in clarifying the precise ways in which vernacular languages emerged through and alongside Sanskrit. This paper closely reads S´ri¯vijaya's Kavira¯jama¯rgam?, paying close attention to the moments of negotiation and adaptation between Sanskrit and Kannada. I focus, in particular, on S´ri¯vijaya's section on poetic flaws or do¯s?as. Spanning over a hundred verses, this lengthy section of the first chapter delineates poetic faults in relation to various parts of language including mixed Sanskrit and Kannada compounds, meter, and similes among many others. Here we see S´ri¯vijaya artfully incorporate material from both Dan?d?in's Ka¯vyadars´a and Bha¯maha's Ka¯vya¯lan?ka¯ra. However, this section is also a moment when S´ri¯vijaya inverts a preexistent Sanskrit rule that metrically violating the caesura (yatibhan?ga) is considered a fault. Following ancient Kannada scholars who "lovingly proposed even faults as virtues," S´ri¯vijaya renames yatibhan?ga as khanda pra¯sa and states that it is preeminent (atis´aya) (KRM, v. 1.75). This example brings us to the limits of a Sanskrit driven model of vernacularization. If Kannada as a literary language emerged through the lexical invasion of Sanskrit, then there are limits to that encounter such as when a Sanskrit fault becomes a Kannada virtue.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Ornaments," or "figures of speech," were the starting point for systematic reflection on literature in South Asia, which came to be known as "the Science of Ornaments." Among these ornaments, there was one, called "taking it back," about which there were a number of different opinions regarding its definition and scope. An examination of the attempts to characterize and exemplify "taking it back" during the early period of South Asian poetics—that is, between the sixth and the ninth centuries ce—shows us how that discourse evolved, and in particular, how ideas of literary ornamentation circulated between different languages and literary traditions. This talk will address two well-known works of poetics in Sanskrit, but it will focus on how they ended up connecting two lesser-known works of poetics, one in Prakrit and the other in Kannada, and the traditions that these works represent.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Consideration a recent monument to the memory of slavery in Alexandria: Path of Thorns and Roses (2014). The artist, Mario Chiodo—a California-based sculptor—modeled the bodies of the enslaved men, women, and children as abject and grief-stricken. Indebted to the modernist handling of materials of Auguste Rodin (Gates of Hell, 1880-1917), Chiodo created a dramatic upward spiral of bodies, clothing, and rose canes. Framed as allegories of Oppression, Struggle, Loss, Sacrifice, Compassion, and Hope, the enfolded bronze bodies suggest the sorrow of slavery with the promise of freedom in the standing male figure high above. The sculptor realized a linear progressive narrative in bronze.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Lecture focused on two kinds of contested space in relation to race and memorializing Harriet Tubman: the physical public space of the city and the virtual space of the digital realm. The first half of this talk considers the representation of Harriet Tubman as a mythic figure, and then looks closely at Alison Saar's Swing Low: Harriet Tubman Memorial. Saar's Swing Low re-inscribes the iconic Tubman on New York City's landscape and within the contested space of Harlem, a historic black neighborhood since the 1900s, now undergoing rapid gentrification and changing demographics. The second half of the paper approaches Saar's memorial in the context of the black digital humanities and the attendant issues of recovery and empathy; race, gender, and identity politics (intersectionality); the archive (data and computation); collaboration; access to resources; and sustainability.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Even before the ink had dried on the Armistice, Western feminists were strategizing for the peace negotiations to come.  "The world," American President Woodrow Wilson had famously declared upon leading his country into World War I, "must be made safe for democracy."  If the peace to be forged in Paris was to bring democratic governance to the nations of the world, women needed to be there to remind global statesmen that neither democracy nor peace could be secured were they to exclude half of humanity.  This paper examines Western feminists' lobbying efforts in Paris in spring 1919, focusing on their attempts to secure women's representation at the peace conference itself and to promote women's political participation at both the national and international levels in the global order to come.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines African American feminist and civil rights activist Mary Church Terrell's advocacy of racial justice and sexual equality in Europe in 1919.  A delegate to the pacifist, feminist congress convening in Zurich, Terrell saw it as her duty to sow disorder among all those who would complacently accept peace terms that did not grapple with the global issue of race relations.  In Europe in 1919, Terrell divided her time between networking with powerful African and Asian statesmen in Paris, imploring white feminists to recognize racial inequality as an impediment to peace and freedom, and fighting the segregated American military for the right to visit the devastated regions of northern France.  Terrell was a powerful spokeswoman for racial justice and women's equality, but her arguments on behalf of the "darker races" of the world sometimes worked unintentionally to undermine both her feminist and civil rights goals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I focus here upon the work of one prolific scribe: John Cok, an Augustinian priest and brother of St. Bartholomew's by 1421. In keeping with the aims of the 2018 Symposium, I consider the crucial importance of visual display and design in one of Cok's books, a small Latin devotional collection (now BL MS Additional 10392), as a means of linking penance, prayer, and meditation for individual or shared reading. I ask what this book might teach us about Cok's pastoral and spiritual life within St. Bartholomew's Hospital and how we may understand his copying as attuned to the overlapping needs of religious and lay readers residing there.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I want to suggest that the treatment of women is central to the literary history of St. Bartholomew's. The dynamic of contamination and purification that always attends the hospital, in its liminal location, is urgently embodied by women, with their inherent physical and mental weaknesses. Today I briefly consider the treatment of women in two works probably written around the turn of the fifteenth century: a Middle English religious narrative (The Book of the Foundation of St. Bartholomew's Church), and a Latin medical compendium (Breviarium Bartholomei, or the Breviary of Bartholomew). My discussion juxtaposes the Book and Breviarium on the topics of losing and regaining, or at least simulating, virginity. I argue that while the priory's foundation narrative represents women as vulnerable to sexual contamination that is exacerbated by the hospital, and can only be purified by a flight from sexuality, the hospital's medical text offers a much more nuanced view of the sexual lives of single women. In these two works we see competing views of virginity: on the one hand, as a "treasure" that once lost, can never be regained, and on the other, as both a physical state and an ongoing social performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Earlier histories of Hansen's disease in colonial Philippines focus on the American policy of forced segregation, while recent studies highlight patients' resistance in Culion, with special emphasis on men. One of the challenges that confront historians of Hansen's disease worldwide is the dearth of patients' accounts of their experiences, and this problem is compounded when dealing with women.  Gendering patient activism in colonial Philippines, this study focuses on women who were forcibly confined in Culion and the San Lazaro hospital during the early twentieth century.  Drawing on multilingual sources, including petitions and letters, I argue that many women consistently expressed and acted upon their desire for freedom from the U.S.-imposed policy of forced confinement and treatment, and from the Catholic nuns' strict dormitory rules, while others focused on daily necessities as they petitioned for improved food rations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2016, the Marco Island Historical Society (MIHS) received a Preservation Assistance Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to purchase preservation supplies necessary to rehouse the entirety of its archaeological holdings from Marco Island, Florida. Sites represented in the collections include Key Marco, Caxambas Point, and Horr's Island, which have been well-known to archaeologists in Florida for a century. Between January 2017 and July 2018, with the assistance of student interns, the MIHS successfully rehabilitated these collections so that they not only be adequately preserved, but also be made readily available to academic researchers and the general public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 2014 to the present, the Moravian Archives, Bethlehem (MAB) has addressed poor access and physical conditions of its Eastern West Indies Collection (EWI), a 120-linear foot collection of records from Moravian congregations in the Caribbean region. The fragile records, transferred to Bethlehem in the 1960s and 1970s, are now in the process of being conserved and digitized, thanks to generous grants in 2018 from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). A selection of these records – documenting Moravian life and worship in St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, Trinidad, Tobago, Dominican Republic, Antigua and St. Kitts – are soon to be accessible online through the Digital Library of the Caribbean. Perhaps owing to limited access conditions, the EWI Collection constitutes a significant but underutilized source body of minutes, correspondence, personnel records, membership records, diaries, school records, linguistic materials, memoirs, and finances. The coinciding conservation and digitization projects warranted improved understandings and descriptions of such records by MAB archivists. During this time, unique opportunities were discovered and considered for researchers working in the fields of Caribbean studies, Moravian studies, and digital humanities. Using unique examples from the Collection, this paper aims to encourage new scholarship and start a conversation with scholars about future opportunities, namely "Citizen Science" crowdsourcing projects, made possible through the 16,814+ images soon to be freely accessible online.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ethnographic studies of hunter-gatherer societies reveal a richness of lifeways that weave together interrelated aspects of society, economy, technology and symbolism. Yet, reconstructions of the lifeways of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers often involves working from a highly fragmented and only partially preserved archaeological record. Here, I assess our current understandings of the Palaeolithic and Epipalaeolithic of Southwest Asia based on the contributions of several foundational interdisciplinary long-term research projects in the region, with a specific focus on those employing microscale analyses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Southwest Asia, the archaeological record of the late Pleistocene exhibits a wide diversity of economic, technological, social and symbolic practices, providing an increasingly nuanced picture of prehistoric behavior. Traditional approaches that focused on the distinctions between hunter-gatherers and food-producers are proving overly simplistic as economic categories are blurred, and the social and ideological practices of these peoples are emphasized. Isolating economic events are difficult, as are reconstructing the impetuses and processes by which these events might have occurred. Much research on contemporary hunter-gatherers has abandoned economic labels in favor of understanding and contextualizing hunter-gatherer ontologies. With a rich dataset over the transition from hunter-gatherer to food-producer in Southwest Asia, we are beginning to explore the value of focusing on the social and ideological worlds of these Pleistocene groups. Much of this work, however, relies on ethnographic analogy and requires a critical approach to its use. With recognition of a ‘long Neolithic' (and debates about whether this is a valid approach to transition), one must ask whether there is a mismatch between archaeological and anthropological usage of the term ‘hunter-gatherer'? Is ethnoarchaeology and ethnography relevant for identifying, defining and interpreting the behavior of archaeological hunter-gatherers? These issues are explored here using the Epipalaeolithic site of Kharaneh IV and the concept of place-making as a case study.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Artistic objects are thought to be one of the hallmarks of the Natufian period, marking a florescence of artistic behavior appearing prior to the origins of agriculture. However, with continuing research into Early and Middle Epipalaeolithic sites in the Levant, new discoveries of ‘symbolic' artifacts are increasing our understanding of even earlier artistic and symbolic pursuits. In this paper we present an engraved plaquette from the Middle Epipalaeolithic context of Kharaneh IV, eastern Jordan. Using white-light confocal microscopy, we analyze manufacturing traces to identify the gestures and tools used to create the plaquette. This artifact, although the only engraved piece recovered from Kharaneh IV thus far, links into wider networks of Epipalaeolithic interaction and cultural exchange. Placing the Kharaneh IV engraved object into regional context with other Early/Middle Epipalaeolithic artistic artifacts, we explore wider networks of interaction prior to the Natufian.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Searching for the origin points of major cultural revolutions and transitions has long been a driver of archaeological research, yet led to research focused on perceived boundaries, rather than continuity. Research into the origins of so-called modern human behavior, the origins of social complexity, the earliest domesticates, among others, all focus on defining moments of change that may be undetectable in the archaeological record. Perhaps some of the most enduring archaeological questions revolve around the ‘origins of agriculture'. In this paper, we explore changing historical conceptions of the ‘origins of agriculture' in Southwest Asia in archaeological discourse and how, through the lens of the longue durée, we can trace aspects of material culture, human action, and complex human-landscape dynamics in deep time. Using examples from the Epipalaeolithic of eastern Jordan, we address current debates on Neolithization by exploring the implications of perspectives that focus on ‘becoming' Neolithic and ‘being' a hunter-gatherer. Through this perspective we discuss different scales of material culture analysis; from the ‘ethnographic' lens identifying individual behaviors in the past, to the longue durée of material culture trends. This multi-scalar perspective gives insights into how we construct cultural boundaries and understand change during the ‘origins of agriculture'.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What constitutes small and unusual will mean different things to different people, so keep in mind that [the author] always be speaking in relative terms. [The author's] working definition of small and unusual data will be texts and languages that are typically not used for developing and testing the tools, methods, and techniques used for Big Data analysis. [The author will] be using "Big Data" as my straw man, even though most data sets in the Humanities are much smaller than those for whom the term is typically used in other fields. But [the author] want[s] to distinguish the types of data [the author] will be discussing the from large corpora of hundreds or thousands of novels in Modern English which are the basis of important Digital Humanities work. {The author will] also be primarily concerned with the application of machine-learning, statistical, and quantitative approaches to the analysis of unstructured texts, which forms one part of what might be called the core of activity in the Digital Humanities. But the issues [the author will] be addressing overlap significantly with other DH activities such as the application of linked data and digital editing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A musical performance can convey both the musicians' interpretation of the written score as well as emphasize, or even manipulate, the emotional content of the music through small variations in timing, dynamics, and tuning. This paper describes the latest developments in a suite of automatic software tools for quantitatively analyzing musical performances for which a corresponding musical score is available, entitled the Automatic Music Performance Analysis and Comparison Toolkit (AMPACT). AMPACT uses a score-informed approach to estimate timing, pitch, and loudness parameters from both monophonic and, now, polyphonic audio. Robust extraction of higher-level timing, pitch, and loudness performance descriptors requires precise frame-level estimation of note onsets and offsets, fundamental frequency, and power. This paper describes the score-informed approaches implemented in AMPACT for this frame-level estimation in polyphonic audio.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper argues for the need to develop a representation for music performance data that is linked with corresponding score information at the note, beat, and measure levels. Building on the results of a survey of music scholars about their music performance data encoding needs, we propose best-practices for encoding perceptually relevant descriptors of the timing, pitch, loudness, and timbral aspects of performance. We are specifically interested in using descriptors that are sufficiently generalized that multiple performances of the same piece can be directly compared with one another. This paper also proposes a specific representation for encoding performance data and presents prototypes of this representation in both Humdrum and Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) formats.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Robust extraction of performance data from polyphonic musical performances requires precise frame-level estimation of fundamental frequency (f0) and power. This paper evaluates a new score-guided approach to f0 and power estimation in polyphonic audio and compares the use of four different input features: the central bin frequencies of the spectrogram, the instantaneous frequency, and two variants of a high resolution spectral analysis. These four features were evaluated on four-part multi-track ensemble recordings, consisting of either four vocalists or bassoon, clarinet, saxophone, and violin (the Bach10 data set) created from polyphonic mixes of the monophonic tracks both with and without artificial reverberation. Score information was used to identify time-frequency regions of interest in the polyphonic mixes for each note in a corresponding aligned score, from which f0 and power estimates were made. The approach was able to recover ground truth f0 within 20 cents on average in reverberation and power within 5 dB for anechoic mixtures, but only within 10 dB for reverberant.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is a framework of geospatial data, metadata, users and tools intended to provide an efficient and flexible way to use spatial information. One of the key software components of an SDI is the catalogue service which is needed to discover, query, and manage the metadata. Catalogue services in an SDI are typically based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) standard which defines common interfaces for accessing the metadata information.  A search engine is a software system capable of supporting fast and reliable search, which may use "any means necessary" to get users to the resources they need quickly and efficiently. These techniques may include features such as full text search, natural language processing, weighted results, fuzzy tolerance results, faceting, hit highlighting, recommendations, feedback mechanisms based on log mining, usage statistic gathering, and many others. In this paper we will be focusing on improving geospatial search with a search engine platform that uses Lucene, a Java-based search library, at its core.  In work funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Centre for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard University is in the process of re-engineering the search component of its public domain SDI (WorldMap http://worldmap.harvard.edu ) which is based on the GeoNode platform. In the process the CGA has developed Harvard Hypermap (HHypermap), a map services registry and search platform independent from WorldMap.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Community reading initiatives, in which a book is selected for system-wide reading and discussion, have become common in many library systems. This paper describes the initial findings in a demographic study of the "One Book, One Chicago" initiative by the Chicago Public Library. Using a multilevel linear model, we show that, over six recent offerings of the "One Book" program, the books vary widely in their uptake by library patrons at different branches, and these differences cannot be entirely explained by demographics or the library's promotional strategies. We thus motivate the next stage of our project, which is to incorporate representations of book content and reader response into the model.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An important dimension of digital humanities pedagogy involves engaging students with what lies "under the hood": with the intellectual architecture of familiar tools and resources. Text markup is an especially compelling topic in the literature and history classroom, for a number of reasons. It engages students in a very close analytical examination of the text, and makes the results of that examination explicit. It prompts a discussion of how we read and interpret documents and for what purpose. It supports inquiry into textual materiality, the significance of print cultures, and historical contexts of primary source documents. It offers an introduction to basic methods of editing, annotation, and explication, and it offers an introduction to a set of tools that are increasingly central to digital humanities scholarship—which have significant professional value outside the academy as well. For all of these reasons, the TEI is a tool of growing importance and pedagogical value for the humanities classroom.   The TEI Archiving, Publishing, and Access Service (TAPAS) offers a repository-based framework for scholars to publish and archive their TEI-encoded materials, including scholarly editions, text anthologies, digitized archival materials, historical papers, manuscripts, and a wide range of other TEI data.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What possibilities exist for digital projects in Indian Country? As video gamers, artists, educators, authors, activists, and scholars grow the field of Digital Native American and Indigenous Studies, this panel looks to explore, articulate, and critique the relationship between digital technologies and NAIS. Weaving together interconnected experiences with digital projects and the questions their non-digital approaches to Native American and Indigenous Studies introduce, this three scholar panel will suggest the benefits and limitations of digital research, teaching, and community engagement for scholarly and public audiences. Meredith McCoy delves into her scholarly platform, the web-based literary magazine/blog The 90%: Stories of Diaspora from Indian Country, to reveal the possibilities for digital communities of Native artists and writers to interrogate colonial constructs, center Indigenous voices, and increase the visibility of diversity within Indian Country. Jennifer Guiliano explores the limitations of open access philosophies including the ways in which digital technologies encourage the reliance on historically problematic colonial archives that obscure Indigenous authority and knowledge. Ricardo Punzalan considers the implications and ethics of bringing Indigenous collections into digital aggregates given the legacy of collecting and social histories confronted by Indigenous communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>[final paragraph of much longer abstract] Digital Humanities articulates three parallel interdisciplinary commitments to "openness": 1) a commitment to open access publishing; 2) a commitment to open access/open source software development; and 3) a commitment to open access data. While the first two trends have received deep and lasting attention via scholarly publishing and digital commons enterprises and the open source development movement promoted by github and other code repositories, the commitment to open access data has been largely undertheorized. Using case studies of Digital Humanities projects that have been developed using Native American and Indigenous content, this submission suggests that Native and Indigenous content complicates the current technical application of open source development driven by digital aggregators and application programming interface development. By highlighting ethical issues around the use, reuse, and distributed architectures encouraged by common digital humanities technologies, this submission suggests that the rhetoric and practice of the open access data movement obscures both Native agency in determining the use of community materials as well as the role of technical determinism in proliferating the violence of colonial archives on Native communities. Questions this submission engages with include: How do we deal with born-digital research data in Native American and Indigenous contexts? How do we as scholars responsibly engage in digital research in Native communities? How do organizations and institutions navigate the cultural, legal, and ethical contexts of the communities whose objects they hold? How can free and open source software solutions be leveraged to build community engagement? Finally, what might be recommended for tribal communities who desire to launch their own digital projects but may have concerns about resources, access, infrastructure, and preservation?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Creating digital scholarly editions of accounts and including references to a shared ontology in the markup can enable comparison of these historical sources using the affordances of the Semantic Web. Tomasek and Vogeler have been working separately for several years, exploring ways to use the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative as a first step in developing models for interoperable digital scholarly editions of accounts. "Transactionography," an XML serialization of information found in accounts that Tomasek and her co-author Bauman proposed in 2013 is the model that grounds the markup for transactions from ancient Japan discussed by Kokaze, Goto, and Nagasaki in their presentation. Orlowska describes factors in choosing a model for producing editions of a large number of documents from widely dispersed archives that will contribute not only to a current project focus on reconstructing networks of annual fairs in late medieval and early modern Poland but also to future projects. And Vogeler demonstrates the value of recommendations for using a common bookkeeping ontology to facilitate interoperability of digital scholarly editions of accounts through the technologies of the semantic web.Presenters on this panel participated in MEDEA activities funded through a Bilateral Digital Humanities award from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the German Research Foundation in 2015-2016.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent developments in reception studies, world literature, and the digital humanities have made effective use of enlarged scale in posing and answering new research questions. The continuously expanding database of the Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama (APGRD; represented in Macintosh et al. 2005), the encompassing of substantial non-western material in comparative literary studies (Damrosch 2003), and the inclusion of vast quantities of non-canonical works enabled by text digitisation (Moretti 2009, Barker and Terras 2016, Long and So 2016) collectively entail new forms of data gathering and visual presentation, which in turn open new hermeneutic horizons.  This paper draws inspiration from computational biology to offer a new method of organising, visualising, and interpreting the reception histories of literary works, focusing on classical drama. We repurpose a technique known as phylogenetic profiling to chart the evolution of Plautus' Amphitryon through a sample of 22 adaptations ranging from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. The paper describes the new methodology, presents resulting analyses about the treatment of dramatic characters across the tradition, and discusses implications for the practice of classical reception studies. To demonstrate the scalability of the approach, we conclude by briefly describing a similar profile of Sophocles' Antigone, which incorporates 129 adaptations spanning four continents.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1524, the German printer and book dealer, Frederick Peypus, published the Nuremberg Map and Hernán Cortés' Second Letter under the title Praeclara Ferdinandi Cortesii de Nova Maris Oceani Hispania Narratio Sacratissio ac. Inuictissimo Carolo Romanorum Imperatori Semper Augusto. Acting as a theatrical space for historical events and Cortés' chivalric fantasies of conquest, the map's intended effect was to capture European sensibilities, drawing the viewer into an unimaginable world across a distant ocean, ultimately bringing the Aztec and Tenochtitlan into the European cultural imagination. Yet, the Nuremberg Map was not the only sixteenth-century image produced of Tenochtitlan for a European audience. Early modern indigenous artists also took line and color to page to offer their own interpretation about the Aztec capital. Study of indigenous pictorials not only suggest different epistemes at work from their European counterpart but equally as important, they inscribe, in picture, the underlying conceptions of Tenochtitlan, its geographic setting, and its most iconic feature: water.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using Norma Cantu's novel Canicula and Roberta Fernandez's novel Intaglio, I examine the extent to which South Texas women writers participate in a "women's" tradition, employing such theoretical tools as feminist standpoint theory to postulate an epistemology that begins with women's "'direct experience of the everyday world."  I also seek to examine the ways that "geographical borders create psychic and epistemic structures for the person who straddles worlds on both sides of the border . . ." (Fetterley and Pryse 252, 257).  With a history fraught with tensions between Native Americans, Hispanics, and Anglos, South Texas is a borderland location that as Gloria Anzaldúa claims, "es una herida abierta where Third World grates against the first and bleeds" (25), a location that asks its writers to explore its multiple borderlands. Indeed, excavating the gaps and borders, the third space, the "decolonial imaginary" (Perez xvi) that women who live in the borderlands straddle provides a way of thinking about person, place, and identity, and the connections between geography and poetics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The IRIS Center at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) partners digital humanities scholars with the public through cross-disciplinary initiatives that encourage innovative solutions to global problems. SIUE is located in Illinois near St. Louis–a diverse region of urban, suburban, and rural areas, divided along racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines. IRIS brings digital humanities programming to the region by embedding itself in the community through partnerships with local organizations. IRIS works with middle and high schools through projects such as Digital East St. Louis, Conversation Toward a Brighter Future, and the STEM meets Humanities initiative's digital humanities clubs–all helping local youth develop independent perspectives and devise solutions to issues important to them. Students document their work through oral histories, podcasts, videos, photographs, and other digital formats that are shared online. These students have created everything from interactive area water quality maps to podcasts about the culture of their hometowns to digital stories about instances of intergenerational conflict in their schools and their proposed solutions. Despite SIUE's status as a regional university, IRIS has managed to have a significant international impact.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At a regional, masters-comprehensive university located in a county characteristic of the rust belt's declining industries and falling populations, significant creativity is needed for a digital humanities center to develop innovative projects that engage a variety of communities while attempting to combat the digital divide. The panel will begin with a brief overview of the center's projects and methods that foster collaboration and creation of local and international communities through digital humanities programming. Center faculty will then provide specific examples of community-focused initiatives.  One collaborative effort is Conversation Toward a Brighter Future 2.0, involving partnerships with a public humanities center and local schools, which aims to mitigate intergenerational conflict by studying concepts of aging alongside social and cultural narratives on these topics and by creating digital storytelling projects about personal and local experiences. The Digital Community Engagement Pathway directly recruits underserved students to take their education outside the walls of the classroom by partnering with community organizations to address major social problems through digital humanities methods. The Manang Languages and Nepal Earthquakes projects highlight the unique challenges of international community engagement and how technology obstacles can reshape the meaning of community collaboration.  When working with any community, we provide training and facilitate program activities in a way that gives participants agency and, by extension, greater ownership over projects they create. We will conclude by examining how these projects provide people opportunities to use digital humanities methods to ensure their voices are heard regarding issues that directly affect their communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper will briefly review the inception and analog-into-digital growth that prison writers forced into being in the APWA; it will address the status of "witness literature" in an era of both mass incarceration and the digital means to make such witness accessible to a global readership.. Even as it disaggregates a mass population into singular voices, hearts and minds, the essays in the APWA reveal larger patterns in prison witness. In 1982, legal scholar Robert Cover observed that the law establishes and maintains its authority on the basis of its monopoly on legally sanctioned violence and the suffering threatened and delivered by such violence. The APWA's writers reveal Cover's unwritten corollary: We cannot know the full human cost or the moral status of any legal state without human witness to the depth and manner of suffering meted out by such violence. This paper will discuss the ethics of managing the APWA and of early work on text analysis, describing decisions to bracket all editorial intervention, subordinating the scholar, digital humanist, and data miner to the roles of facilitators of the unregulated interface of prison testimony and global readers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The purpose of this roundtable session is to acquaint the SHEAR audience with a newly launched website, MAPPING EARLY AMERICAN ELECTIONS (MEAE) (www.earlyamericanelecttions.org), a project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and created by a team at George Mason University's Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. The project uses information from the New Nation Votes database, the most complete set of election returns available for the period before 1825. Unlike previously printed congressional atlases, the maps in this project depict election returns in a granular fashion--at the country level rather than at the district or state level. They are also interactive in nature. While the maps are based on the NNV data, the project team had to create what amounts to a new dataset in order to be able to map the election returns. This included associating the election data with the spatial data in the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries and United States Congressional District Shapefiles, creating links to the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, and identifying party affiliations for many Congressional candidates. Changes in election laws and procedures in each state have also been taken into account, thus allowing for easier comparison of the results over time and across states.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents my findings regarding Numak'aki [Mandan, now Nu'eta] painted buffalo robes from the Five Village Alliance period (1781–1837) along the Upper Missouri River. Closely looking at materials and designs, a pattern emerges that suggests these robes bore cosmological imagery that was then overlaid with political meanings during the Five Village Alliance, a political and military agreement between five earthlodge villages of Numak'aki and neighboring Minitari [Hidatsa] peoples that emerged after the smallpox epidemic of 1781. Utilizing ka-ka (elder) interviews from the 1830s and 1910s as well as historical Nu'eta language, this paper advocates for a "local art history" (Fred Myers, Painting Culture) that seeks to understand historical Native-made objects through the terms and beliefs of a specific local community. In contrast to the dominant iconographic methods of Native art history, where a symbol has a singular interpretation and political possibilities have been ignored, this paper analyzes these robes as creative material records that bear the marks of specific Native historical experience and practice. Created during a period of massive historical change and survival pressures, Numak'aki robes potentially visualized the political and social creativity, flexibility, and adaptation that underwrote Native survivance and the Alliance itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper shows how the authors and redactors of the Islamic psalms reconciled the traditional image of David's psalmody with a Qur'anic conception of scripture. Only in psalm 1 was the Biblical text preserved. Psalm 2 was modified to preempt Christian interpretations that made it a proclamation of Jesus' divine sonship, and the beginning of Psalm 3, retained only in the Sufi recension, had to be marked as "the words of David" because the rest of the text is framed as God's speech, not the psalmist's. From that point on the Biblical text disappears, but the Qur'an is often quoted or paraphrased, and the coming of Muhammad is duly announced. The Koranic recension ends each psalm with a Qur'anic–sounding phrase such as "I am Mighty and Wise." Some manuscripts label each psalm a sura, and lay out the text as in a mu??af. Yet the Biblical Psalms are not forgotten. Amid snippets of wisdom, exhortations to prepare for the afterlife, and admonitions about a variety of sins, there appear hymns of praise, human calls for divine assistance, and echoes of the penitential Psalms. David laments his transgressions quite explicitly in some versions, though in others he is shielded from grave sin. In form, style, and content these rewritten psalms are more Qur'anic than Biblical, yet their ethos of piety, penitence, and praise have much in common with the scripture they purport to replace. Indeed, they were not intended as a challenge to the supposedly corrupted Psalms of Jews and Christians. Rather than interreligious polemic, appropriation, or forgery (as Ignaz Goldziher called them), these psalms constitute an intrareligious polemic against worldly fellow Muslims, constructed from a repertoire of motifs, aphorisms, characters, and imagined books that, in the minds of their Muslim authors, were the common property of all scrupulously pious believers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Some Arabic manuscripts of the "Psalms of David" contain not the Biblical Psalms but Muslim compositions that sound more like the Qur'an: not human praises and prayers to God, but God's admonitions to the prophet David, urging him to flee the pleasures of this world, spend his nights in repentant prayer, and prepare for the Day of Judgment. This new scripture exists in several recensions stemming from a single eighth– or ninth–century collection of one hundred psalms. Only a small fragment of that text has been preserved in its original form, but it was edited, rewritten, rearranged, and expanded by later editors, each of whom sought to align it to his or her own religious vision, resulting in what I call the Koranic, Orthodox, Pious, and Sufi versions. By purporting to present the authentic Psalms of David, these texts appear to embody the common Muslim claim that the Bible is textually corrupt, but in fact they show little concern for textual authenticity. Each editor freely rewrote and improved the text, using the concept of "the Psalms of David" as an opportunity for creative writing in a Qur'anic style. When these psalms were last studied by orientalists over a century ago, they were dismissed as polemical forgeries, but that misses the point. Their interreligious polemic is incidental; their main target is worldly Muslims. In fact, they illustrate vividly how many symbols and values their Muslim authors shared with Jews and Christians: the figure of David, his Psalms and his sins, virtue and repentance, asceticism and spirituality, heaven and hell, and a rich common stock of maxims and metaphors. At a time when both scholars of religion and the American public are probing the boundaries of western and Islamic civilizations, and making crucial decisions about whether to imagine them as distinct or bound together, this curious instance of "rewritten Bible" provides a concrete manifestation of the contested but interwoven moral landscape that they share.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Numerous Arabic manuscripts of "the Psalms of David" contain not translations of the Biblical Psalms but original Islamic compositions in which God exhorts David to repent of his sin and pursue a life of otherworldly devotional piety. When several of these manuscripts were studied piecemeal in the early twentieth century they appeared to be unrelated, and were dismissed as so many forgeries. A comparative study of a dozen manuscripts shows that they are all revisions and expansions of a lost source text consisting of one hundred psalms, which newly discovered evidence (described by Ursula Bsees in another paper at this conference) allows us to date to the late eighth or early ninth century. This confirms that the source text was an early literary expression of an ascetical renunciant piety (described by Christopher Melchert and others) that flourished in the seventh, eighth, and early ninth centuries, when similar forms of Christian monastic piety were still regarded positively by some Muslims, and before Islamic asceticism lost ground to more inward and mystical forms of piety. The original text reflected what Nimrod Hurvitz calls mild asceticism, urging disdain for this world and total dependence on God without entirely rejecting private property or marriage. Later recensions of the text, however, softened and modified its ascetical tone in various ways, the Pious recension emphasizing adherence to the letter of the law, and the Sufi recension transforming David's piety from tearful fear of hell into loving devotion. These recensions reflect divergent strands in the development of Islamic piety, while testifying to David's continuing appeal as an exemplar of repentance and otherworldliness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Numerous Arabic manuscripts of "the Psalms of David" contain not translations of the Biblical Psalms but original Islamic compositions in which God exhorts David to repent of his sin and pursue a life of ascetic devotional piety. These rewritten psalms exist in several recensions based on one original source text that is now mostly lost. In form and content they are more Qur'anic than Biblical, but they preserve occasional echoes and quotations of Biblical material. Only in the twelfth–century "Sufi" recension is there evidence that the redactor made use of an Arabic translation of the Bible. The other recensions, like the original source text, contain paraphrases of Biblical passages that were learned by early Muslims and then preserved and embellished in historical and pietistic literature. They also contain Qur'anic material and Islamic traditions such as divine sayings, parables, and wise maxims of a distinctly ascetic character. The recent discovery of a fragmentary copy of the original source text, on papyrus, confirms that it originated among early Muslim ascetics (partly inspired by Christian monks) who flourished in the seventh, eighth, and early ninth centuries before losing ground to advocates of more mystical and legal forms of piety.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On the Adriatic coast of southern Italy, the site of Salapia has been the focus of archaeological excavations since 2014. As a town established in the 1st c. BCE, with a long occupation into the late 8th c. CE, and later resettled by a medieval castrum, Salapia provides a unique opportunity to theorize the relationship between successive phases of settlement and social meaning in the long-term. Evidence from the 2018 campaign has detailed how, starting in the late 5th c. CE and continuing for the duration of the 6th c. CE, inhabitants repurposed the structures of the Roman and Late Antique town, with each room reworked and re-inhabited, attesting to the concentration and intensity of occupation. Such patterns continue into the 7th c. CE, although the remains of the former Roman structures were in an ever more ruined state. The continuous reoccupation wore them away, just as it was dependent on them both materially and conceptually. These standing remains appear to have still helped solidify the community connections in this landscape, and to make it distinct from other places along the coast. By the 8th c. CE, the ruins of Salapia were barely visible across the eastern portion of the coastal plain, where the new village of huts was organized differently from previous settlements. We might then identify a more decisive break with what had come before, and a transformation in the relationship between people and this landscape that was diversely (perhaps less) cohesive and sustaining of community ties, as a period of abandonment shortly followed. If the ruins were better preserved further west, they did not entice new inhabitants to them for at least another two centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent studies of both long-lived and extinct towns in Italy, and the empire generally, have turned to interrogating the later centuries of habitation to model patterns of continuity and abandonment in myriad forms. The site of Salapia on the Adriatic Coast of Southern Italy offers a compelling example through which to investigate the character of such settlement transformations over more nearly fifteen hundred years. While the Roman settlement was primarily located on the extensive plain adjacent to the Salpi lagoon, its western portion forms the initial deposit atop which subsequent occupations were installed, forming the topographic feature of the Monte di Salpi. The Monte's latest habitation phases are dated to the late 13th c.-early 14th c. C.E., attesting to the spatial continuity of settlement through time. New evidence from the 2017 season allows us to theorize the shifts from the Roman and late antique phases to the medieval town, providing material manifestations of how such persistent but consistently fluctuating occupation strategies were brought about. It is a narrative written through negative archaeological features as much as through positive ones. Two new trenches, one on the Monte and one at its base on the plain, provide evidence of the link between the end of late antiquity to the emergence of the medieval community.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Are you an accidental archive? Like many counties in Kentucky, Boone County doesn't have a county-wide organization to accept historical artifacts or family collections.  BCPL was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to accept family collections of papers, photographs and memorabilia. If we didn't, the collections would most likely be tossed in the dumpster, but we were not prepared for the long-term care of fragile materials. We had become an accidental archive.    In 2017, BCPL applied for and received an NEH Collection Assessment grant to take a serious look at its ever-growing physical repository. The department is using the assessment as a tool to help develop future strategic planning for overall BCPL facility improvements, as the Local History Department continues to grow in demand as a local repository. The presentation will discuss what we learned from the process and if an NEH Collection Assessment grant is right for your library.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Complied Service Records of Confederate Soldiers Who Served in Organizations Raised Directly by the Confederate Government" for the 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles provide a window into the experiences of Civil War soldiers in Indian Territory.  These troops often did not leave other kinds of records such as journals or diaries, and letters home were rare indeed.  Service records include important information about when and where soldiers mustered for battle and for how long they enlisted.  The accompanying records in the service jackets, while uneven and unpredictable, offer further glimpses of daily life for the troops.  The importance of horses, for instance, becomes apparent.  The records tracked the movement of federal prisoners of war from camp to camp and showed that some soldiers chose to swear the Oath of Loyalty and even joined federal units.  Other prisoners of war were exchanged.  The records also included more mundane, though consequential, information such as petitions for promotion, letters of resignation, and certificates of disability.  The records offer the opportunity to add meat to barebones data about troop movements and battle losses. A picture emerges of enthusiastic Choctaw enlistees at the beginning of the war, whose support of the war waned as they were plagued by poor provisions and desertion as the war progressed.  Thus, Choctaw Confederates were not so different from Southern Confederates in many respects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2016, the Marco Island Historical Society (MIHS) received a Preservation Assistance Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to purchase preservation supplies necessary to rehouse the entirety of its archaeological holdings from Marco Island, Florida. Sites represented in the collections are world-renowned and have been well-known to archaeologists in Florida for a century. Between January 2017 and July 2018, with the assistance of student interns, the MIHS successfully rehabilitated these collections so that they not only be adequately preserved, but also be made readily available to academic researchers and the general public. The MIHS was the only organization to receive a Preservation Assistance Grant for Smaller Institutions in Florida and the only non-university organization to receive an NEH grant of any kind in the State of Florida in 2016.</Abstract>

In much of China, a more illiberal political climate under Xi Jinping, crackdowns on human rights lawyers and unauthorized religious groups, new limits on nongovernmental organizations, and an increasingly pervasive surveillance state.  In Xinjiang, there are detention and internment of Uyghurs on a massive scale, and mounting state-created threats to ethnic and Muslim identity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This international conference on landscape archaeology was held at the German Archaeological Institute in Istanbul.  It aimed to bring together archaeologists and other professional researchers that are interested in landscape and landscape-based approaches, with a special focus on the Near East.  Dr. Skotheim presented a landscape approach to ancient festivals, focusing particularly on the festivals of Aphrodisias and the Demostheneia festival at Oinoanda. She argued that these festivals can be viewed as manipulating movement of goods and people through the landscape, and that ephemeral products such as food, drink, vegetal decorations, and vegetal prizes may have evoked the seasonality and locality of the festivals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Skotheim examined the lamps of Knidos, which are decorated with theatrical imagery, particularly masks, along with vegetal motifs. These lamps were found in votive deposits at the sanctuary of Demeter at Knidos.  They are part of a broader trend in many areas of the Mediterranean (in Sicily, Greece, and Asia Minor) in which terracotta lamps with theatrical imagery, as well as terracotta figurines of actors, were associated with Demeter. She discussed the relationship of drama to the cult of Demeter which reflect the similarities between Demeter and Dionysus.  Both were agricultural deities, with cult celebrations at harvest-time, and both were associated with death and rebirth.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In September 1920, following months of contentious debate in the renegade parliament of what later became the Republic of Turkey (1923-), MPs approved a law that prohibited the production, sale, importation, and consumption of alcohol. This history provides not only a crucial foundation for grasping today's anti-alcoholism and Islamism under PM Erdogan; it also must be understood as an episode integral to the global dynamics of temperance and prohibitionism that impacted many states of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper analyzes gendered practices of divination in Turkey as a subaltern vernacular for those disadvantaged along the multiple axes of hetero-patriachal hierarchies and as a medium of navigating gendered and sexualized marginalization. Intimate publics formed around divination offer a safer venue for women and queer folk to explore their desires in context of a disciplining and moralizing public sphere colored by a reinvented gender traditionalism and masculinist violence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1929, Federico García Lorca left Spain for New York in order to find solutions to his depressed emotional state and artistic crisis. Lorca arrived in time to witness the Wall Street Crash, which emblematized capitalist modernity's inequalities. Such inequities were nowhere more apparent to Lorca than in Harlem, the refuge of New York's African-Americans, which he portrayed in a three-poem section of his volume Poet in New York [Poeta en Nueva York; 1929-30]. Lorca encountered modernity's antithesis in Harlem's vernacular and ‘high' art forms, from jazz, blues, and gospel to the Harlem Renaissance. Yet Lorca also found inspiration in the very modernity that he criticized. For not only did Lorca draw on art particular to Harlem—with its own fraught relationship to the modern—but also in forms originating in Spain and other parts of Europe—including Surrealism's embrace of individual desires.   I examine the way in which, on the one hand, Lorca looks to the vernacular art forms of the oppressed—African-Americans and Spain's rural and Roma peoples. On the other hand, the Surrealist and Harlem-Renaissance forms that he uses to portray New York are at once skeptical, and part and parcel, of capitalist modernity. Ironically, wrestling with such paradoxes provides Lorca with a means to resolve the tensions underlying his artistic and personal crises. For these paradoxes become paradigmatic of how ‘high' modernist and ‘low' vernacular forms may ethically engage each other—resisting the vernacular's recuperation and neo-Romantic notions of authenticity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Spanish poet Gerardo Diego (Santander, 1896-1987) became renown during his lifetime for his ‘classic' style, notably the incomparable sonnet "El ciprés de Silos," which generations of schoolchildren in Spain learned by heart. Such classic poetry, regarded favorably by the Spanish academic and cultural establishment, led in great part to Diego's induction into the Real Academic Española (1947) as well as the award of the Premio Cervantes to him (and Jorge Luis Borges) in 1979. Before the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), however, and among students of his work, Diego was also recognized as a key figure in the Spanish avant-garde; his poetry volumes Imagen (1922) and Manual de espumas (1924) set the pace for the poetic vanguard in 1920s Spain, especially the Creacionismo movement, although it must be emphasized that Diego should be considered as an essentially idiosyncratic poet who used different styles as he saw fit throughout his prolific corpus.   Given Diego's level of recognition as well as his achievement as a poet, it remains surprising that another crucial aspect of his work has remained largely unexplored: the engagement with popular and traditional poetry (poesía popular and poesía de tipo tradicional) and music. In actuality, Diego's fascination with popular and traditional poetry and music from the inception of his career augurs the stylization of popular and traditional forms which would become characteristic not only of his work, but also that of such Generation of 1927 figures as Rafael Alberti (1902-1999) and Federico García Lorca (1898-1936). Diego's great knowledge of music and gift for the piano informs this affinity for the popular and traditional.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the early 1900s, before the earliest known work on the Northern Paiute language was published, a skilled amateur linguist and physician named Dr. W. L. Marsden began documenting the language of Captain (Patotzi) Louie in the town of Burns in eastern Oregon. As a doctoral student of Mary Haas at the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages (SCOIL), Michael J. P. Nichols spent three summers conducting field research near Burns, Oregon, with Marian Jim Louie, the daughter-in- law of Captain Louie. Nearly thirty years after Nichols' time in Burns, the co-authors began working together to document the stories of elders of the Burns Paiute Tribe, including those recollected by two of Marian Louie's children, among others. This presentation explores the changes that can be traced both in the Northern Paiute language itself across three generations of speakers of the same communolect and in the approaches to and products of documentation by evaluating both in terms of language maintenance efforts and linguistic science. Greater understanding of variation can contribute to revitalization efforts through the incorporation of legacy materials into the process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To stoke fears and hatred of foreign nations to serve internal needs is a recurring pattern in modern Chinese national identity discourse. Drawing upon a vast collection of Chinese leaders' political rhetoric and memoirs, party documents, and propaganda materials, as well as secondary literature, this paper investigates Mao Zendong's manipulation of anti-Soviet discourse between 1959-1969 to discredit domestic opponents and push through radical economic and political adventures. In summer 1959, facing sharp criticisms of the Great Leap Forward modeled on Revolutionary Stalinism, Mao at the Lushan Conference purged party dissidents like Peng Dehuai as "right-ward opportunists" with "illicit ties" to Moscow that also disapproved Mao's policies. Thereafter, Beijing brought Sino-Soviet ideological conflict into the open. By refuting Khrushchev's de-Stalinization and condemning his "revisionist" deviations from orthodox socialism, Mao silenced domestic opposition while relaunching the Leap. As the intra-party rift widened following the Leap's fiasco, Mao escalated anti-Soviet polemics and further intertwined it with internal campaigns bashing Soviet-style revisionism. This two-front war culminated in the Cultural Revolution, when "capitalist roaders in power" like Liu Shaoqi and just anyone who disagreed with Mao in and outside his own party were accused of being revisionists or even "China's Khrushchev."  At the same time, in order to justify and reinforce the great revolution at home, the Maoist faction kept the tension level with Moscow high, to the point of disrupting a normal diplomatic relationship and eventually sliding to the brink of war.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first is to release the shipwreck's narrative from its dependence on Justinian; recent finds raise doubts regarding this connection and its required chronology, freeing the vessel to serve as a broader marker of routine Late Antique connectivity. The second is to examine how this assemblage can inform our understanding of the shape and resilience of the maritime economy in the decades preceding Justinian's reign. By evaluating the potential scale and radiating effects of this ship's loss, we argue for a much broader impact on connectivity that went beyond simply one expensive architectural project. Framing the shipwreck as an economic disaster opens an alternative window into the individuals, communities, and institutions whose investments—at least on more fortuitous occasions—sustained connections across the early sixth-century Mediterranean.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ongoing underwater survey off southeast Sicily aims to explore more than two millennia of maritime activity at the fishing and commercial port of Vendicari. Undertaken as part of the Marzamemi Maritime Heritage Project, investigations here have recently focused on the rich late antique material record, which offers a window into this strategic crossroads of Mediterranean connectivity during a transformative period. This paper introduces the maritime cultural landscape of Vendicari and discusses the first results, with particularly emphasis on the utility of systematic transect survey for revealing seabed site formation processes and broad patterns of seaborne interaction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 2013, investigations of the famous Marzamemi "church wreck" have aimed to shed new light on this monumental 6th-century CE assemblage off the Sicilian coast. With a load of more than one hundred tons of prefabricated religious and decorative architectural elements, the site has long been associated with the massive building program that followed Justinian's brief re-conquest of the late Roman west. Five fieldwork campaigns to date, however, have raised critical questions about the longstanding narrative of an imperially sponsored "flat-pack" structure designed for rote assembly at a single destination. Alongside re-evaluation of the major architectural elements, analysis of the shipboard assemblage, secondary cargo, and broader historical context provides new clues about private commercial and directed exchange, local and imperial patronage and propaganda, and maritime connectivity more generally. From cooking pots, iron fasteners and tools, to transport amphora lids, mineral pigments, and stone and glass "samples," recent finds offer a window into the logistics and mechanisms of stone transport that were fundamental to massive late antique elite urban building programs. At the same time, a more holistic view of the shipwreck assemblage demonstrates the complexity of interrelated processes that fostered and sustained socioeconomic connectivity more generally through these final years of large-scale trans-Mediterranean exchange.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As an outspoken voice of Haitian democracy under station director Jean Dominique, Radio Haiti occupied a unique place in Haitian culture and politics from the early 1970s until 2003.  As the first news outlet in Haiti to broadcast serious reporting in Haitian Creole – the language of the Haitian majority – Radio Haiti provided a platform to amplify the voices of people who had long been socially and politically excluded. Broadcasting in Haitian Creole was itself a critique of the power structure that favored the French-speaking political and economic elite.  In its news, interviews, and programming, Radio Haiti also undertook devoir de mémoire --memory work, the duty to remember – –  by revisiting their own archives and commemorating  key moments in Haitian history as part of a battle against erasure and forgetting.  We contend that the interviews that make up a significant portion of the collection are oral history, representing rare real-time accounts of events that are not recorded in written histories, and voices of rural farmers, factory workers, marketwomen, Vodou adherents, and other people whose words are largely absent from written histories. This archive is itself an act of devoir de mémoire -- preserving Haitian history as part of a duty to remember. Speakers include J.J. Dominique (Jean Dominique's daughter and Radio Haiti station manager), as well as Laura Wagner, Radio Haiti Archivist, and Craig Breaden, Audiovisual Archivist, from Duke University's Rubenstein Library.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past several years, many digital humanities projects have emerged on various platforms that have paid special attention to Haiti. These projects include: A Colony in Crisis: The Saint-Domingue Grain Shortage of 1789, Haiti: An Island Luminous, the Haitian History Blog, the Haiti Memory Project, Radio Haiti Archives (Achiv Radyo Ayiti), La Gazette Royal, HaitiDOI.com, and others. Apart from the creation of projects, archivists, students, scholars and teachers have begun adopting digital methods for classroom and practical use to help further the study and preservation of knowledge pertaining to Haiti and its diaspora. This roundtable will discuss existing and forthcoming digital humanities projects in Kreyòl, English, and French.  In addition, we will consider issues relating to digital project creation, interaction with Haitian archives, classroom uses, and public engagement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This round table discussion examines Haitian journalism in a rapidly-changing world, in which technological innovations such as social media have democratized the production and circulation of information while also creating new avenues for misinformation, rumor, division, and unfounded opinion. Who can be a journalist in Haiti today? How have notions of truth and objectivity in Haitian journalism evolved through the late 20th century to the early 21st century? As technology increasingly allows for preservation of what were once impermanent media, might journalists consider themselves not only collectors and disseminators of information, but also documentarians of the past and of history. How might the digitized archives of a radio station -- ephemeral broadcasts now transformed into historical documents -- inform and shape contemporary journalistic practice?  Specifically, what is the significance and relevance of the digital online archives of Radio Haïti-Inter to investigative journalists on the ground in Haiti today?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As my study of George Jardine now has led me to a study of religion and philosophy in my pursuit of investigating Jardine's influence in North America, I feel I am only now after 18 years of study, ¬¬presentations and publications getting at the heart of Jardine's contributions to pedagogy and ultimately what I think is his rhetorical theory—epistemic writing.  Questions from the philosophers at this conference also open other avenues of Jardine study that I must follow and include—namely Jardine's instruction in philosophy. I am the researcher and pupil of an influential, yes, but also impressive predecessor.  One who continues to engage my attention as a supreme teacher and administrator, but also as an intellectually compassionate rhetorician who took the time to fully understand his students and fellow teachers' needs –at the expense of self-promotion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Robinson (47-ON-27) and Squirrel Dam (47-ON-21) sites are two of the largest sites excavated during the Northern Lakes Project. Both sites were excavated in all four years of the project (1965-1968), but Robert Salzer's 1969 dissertation and his follow-up 1974 publication on the project include data from the first two years only. This means that the published record discusses only a portion of the work done at both sites. Recent examination, inventory, and rehousing of the entire collection (over 67,000 objects and samples) and associated documentation from both sites has made the recovered material as well as numerous features, activity areas, post molds possibly representing structures, and deposits associated with specific cultural periods more easily amenable to study. The rehousing project did not incorporate in-depth analysis, but the new inventory and improved access to the collections can help archaeologists form research questions appropriate to the hitherto underappreciated range and richness of the two sites' data sets.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Robert Salzer's 1969 dissertation on the Northern Lakes discussed 12 sites in detail, but 76 additional sites were surveyed during the first two years of the Northern Lakes Project (1965-1966). Recently inventoried and rehoused collections from these sites contain 7,787 artifacts, and 43 of the sites produced potentially diagnostic material. These sites helped form Salzer's cultural chronology of the Northern Lakes region. An example of such a site is Mohawk Point (47-ON-28) where over 2,000 artifacts were collected including Late Paleo-Indian, Middle Woodland, and Late Woodland projectile points and portions of at least 35 ceramic vessels. These sites provide important information on settlement patterns, economic systems, and technology, and the survey data form a baseline for resource management and preservation efforts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Logan Museum of Anthropology is engaged in a multi-stage collections improvement project whose goal is to improve preservation of and access to the museum's archaeological and ethnographic collections. Substantial staff and student effort has been allocated to the project, supported largely by grants. At the start of the project, archaeological collections deriving from field schools, CRM work, and other sources were housed in a wide range of conditions and had varying levels of physical and intellectual accessibility. In previous papers and presentations we supplied progress reports on our efforts to curate these generally neglected and poorly known collections. Here, we discuss specific curation strategies we have applied to particularly challenging collections with poor documentation and inappropriate storage containers and to collections deriving from injudicious collecting strategies. We also show how this curatorial work has benefited current research projects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Physical and intellectual accessibly are essential if archaeological collections are to be utilized for research, teaching, and interpretation. The curation crisis brought an acute awareness of the value and irreplaceable nature of these collections and heightened the standards for their preservation and access. The Logan Museum of Anthropology's Collections Accessibility Project is one model of how previously neglected and underutilized archaeological collections have been given new life through cataloguing, computerization, and proper documentation. Collection assessments and pilot projects laid the foundation for federal and private funding that enabled the Logan Museum to dramatically improve preservation of and access to over 100,000 archaeological artifacts and associated documentation resulting from the Northern Lakes Project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>John Chrysostom's Exegetical Homilies on the Gospel of John were translated into Syriac in the fifth century and enjoyed great popularity in Syriac-speaking churches. As instances of cross-cultural reception and recontextualization, they put the voice of the Golden Mouth into an oriental idiom, drawing him into various conversations that were fundamental to the development of the Syriac heritage. His impact on that heritage is signalled by the number of Syriac manuscripts containing the Homilies, the controversy alleged to have surrounded his exegetical legacy in the Syriac Church of the East (i.e. "Nestorians"), and his continuing Nachleben in the broader Syriac interpretive, ascetic, and liturgical traditions. The Homilies are saturated with biblical citation and exposition, supplying early evidence pertinent to the rich Syriac biblical tradition and illuminating the ways in which Greek Antiochene exegesis was being appropriated into oriental Christian communities. The Syriac Homilies have even been heralded as a principal source of evidence for a pre-canonical form of the Greek text of John's Gospel.  Despite the remarkable age and inherent richness of the texts, only preliminary studies have been done so far. Indeed, it has only recently become possible to gain access to portions of the extant Syriac evidence in Damascus, and due to recent work, it has also now become possible to identify previously unknown manuscripts and fragments containing portions of the text and to "reunite" formerly separated portions of important early evidence from Sinai that had been scattered across Europe. This paper briefly presents the results of a thorough analysis of these texts, including those having recently come to light, in order to clarify their significance as early evidence for Chrysostom's Homilies and for multiple avenues of other research across a wide range of interests in Greek and Syriac patristics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Religious World of Late Antiquity, Word as Object: The centrality of scripture in early Syriac Christian tradition is obvious. Less well-understood are the methods by which the power of scripture was brought to bear on the ordinary lives of common Christian folk, outside the official contexts of liturgical practice. A unique early Syriac manuscript of John's Gospel supplies a glimpse into the practices of specialized interpreters who sought mystical guidance in the Bible according to methods that were often considered illicit. The manuscript includes an apparatus unlike that of any known collection of sortes, incorporated directly into the biblical text. In response to specific questions, the volume offers inspired words of guidance to the inquirer in a process superintended by clergy who were considered unconventional. Although its true function was effectively disguised by means of a spurious scribal association with Chrysostom's Commentary on John, this paper makes evident the true nature of the volume as a biblical text interspersed throughout a magical framework. That the practice of consulting Bibles in such a manner was fairly widespread and long-lived is evident both from the repeated canonical attempts to suppress the practice and from the fragmentary, often vestigial testimony in the Greek, Latin, Armenian, Georgian, and Syriac biblical traditions. The proposed paper will present a summary of the unique evidence of the Syriac manuscript and compare it to other pertinent evidence. The study focuses interest on the text as an expression of popular faith in scripture's authority and as evidence for a particular mode of Christian interpretation, one that seeks to establish dynamic connections between the biblical text and the daily lives of common folk within a sophisticated context of clerical practice, institutional prohibition, and widespread popular use.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Syriac Literature and Interpretations of Sacred Texts, Interdisciplinary Approaches. Focusing especially on John Chrysostom's Exegetical Homilies on the Gospel of John, this paper traces and interprets important ways in which Syriac versions of his texts were being used within the Syriac tradition. It follows some of the lines of reception from the original versions to their adaptation into such applications as homiliaries, polemical florilegia, doctrinal anthologies, and so forth. For this work, the paper draws on West Syrian, Melkite, and Eastern sources.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The lance of St. Maurice was a real weapon; it was also an imperial insigne visible in coin, seal, and miniature portraits of the Saxon emperors.  This spear, in whose blade was embedded a nail from Christ's Crucifixion, was believed to have been carried by the third-century martyr particularly venerated in the Middle Ages for his stand against paganism; legend also associated it with Constantine.  Otto I (r. 936-973) defended an internal assault on his authority while bearing the lance at the Battle of Birten in 939, and scholarship to date has emphasized the role of the lance in the assertion of legitimate kingship.  However, Otto also carried the spear during his rout of the pagan Hungarians at the Battle of the Lech in 955.  In this paper, I place the lance and representations of it in the context of the Ottonian campaign to subjugate and convert to Christianity the Slavs and Hungarians whose agitative presence along the Elbe River had long been a concern for western rulers.  I view the lance and related images as one facet of a military-missionary strategy, developed initially by Otto I and carried forward by his successors, that employed visual and symbolic means in addition to strong-arm tactics to prosecute its cause.  The importance to Otto of the lance and the soldier-saint who first carried it was evident by 937, when the newly crowned German king founded and dedicated to St. Maurice a monastery at Magdeburg on the Elbe.  Magdeburg, elevated in 968 to an archbishopric, was conceived by Otto as the primary locus of representation of Holy Roman Imperial authority, with its intertwined secular and sacred dimensions.  I thus place the lance in the Magdeburg context, discussing surviving elements from the Ottonian cathedral that likewise suggest a visual strategy in the proselytizing expansionism of the Ottonian rulers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Most critical analyses on Claudio Magris explore the complex question of individual and collective identity in his essayistic and creative works through the motifs of fluidity (embodied above all by the sea) and of travel (especially in connection with the ambivalence of the frontier). &amp;#x0D; However, less attention has been paid to the significance of a related cluster of images and concepts, namely, actual dwelling or symbolic homeliness, which, in a dialectical tension with fluidity and travel, play an equally crucial role in Magris's writing, interweaving the biographical sphere of personal experiences and memories with the historical, political and cultural underpinnings of the idea of homeland, ranging from the local and regional levels to the national and transnational dimensions (Europe in particular).&amp;#x0D;  This presentation highlights how notions like ‘temporary housing', ‘literature as relocation' or the more general concept of ‘threshold' emerging from such essays as  Lontano da dove ,  Utopia e disincanto ,  Itaca e Oltre  and  L'infinito viaggiare  find fertile ground in the form and content of Magris's own narrative and plays, where they frame what I define as the "poetics and ethics of Europeanness" contained in Magris's overall oeuvre. As my analysis aims to show, Magris's creative production hence authenticates a theoretical reflection on the significance of ‘home' for identitarian, linguistic, and political purposes that also reconceptualizes Europe as geographical and temporal lodging and dislodgement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The destiny of democracy in Europe is being discussed from multiple perspectives. However, very little attention has been devoted so far to literature as an expressive form able not only to reelaborate creatively the main issues of the process of Europeanization but also to contribute to the very formation of the debate on European questions, anticipating positions that take shape only later in other disciplines. &amp;#x0D; My paper intends to examine the modalities with which the notion of democracy intervenes in the many literary transfigurations of the idea of Europe. Through the discussion of essays and novels representative of an explicitly European AND democratic consciousness, I linger on the ideological, political, cultural and linguistic implications of such a connection, highlighting potentialities and problems.&amp;#x0D; From the Europeanist idylss of Denis De Rougemont, to Stefan Zweig's "Europe of yesterday", from Diego Marani's "europanto" to the pseudo-Europeanization of Ben Jelloun's migrants, from Claudio Magris's anti-globalization Europe to Tim Parks's "euro-scepticism", I emphasize how, in the realm of imagination, to think and rethink Europe means, above all, to think and rethink democracy inside and outside its mobile boundaries, laying bare its aporiae. The literature of Europe plays an ethical role. It monitors and denounces the inconsistencies and hypcrisies of the connection between Europe and democracy. &amp;#x0D; In my essay, the literary thematization of the European question provides the context to analyze the role of the narrative dimension in the critique of democracy. Narrating Europe, writing constructs and deconstructs, in the Derridian sense, its democratic ambitions. It reduces the exportability of concepts and values upon which its alleged "society of citizens" is founded or should be founded, and warns against inauthentic egalitarianism and "political correctness".</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although ethnomusicologists and dance scholars have long been interested in the ways that culture is transmitted, which involves processes of learning and creativity, related studies are a recent development in both fields.  One such learning/creative process that remains to be researched in depth is dance/music improvisation (Hayes 2003; Nettl 2005).  Analysis of how dance is improvised to improvised musical accompaniment, for example, can contribute towards the understanding of these processes and show how music and dance come together--another topic worthy of research (Hanna 1992).  In this paper, I discuss Argentine malambo, the lone solo dance in the country's folklore repertoire, which is performed to improvised accompaniment.  Danced only by men, associated with the virile gaucho and Argentine identity/tradition, and done in both northern and southern styles, malambo survives mostly in formal competitions at which prizes are awarded to either solo dancers—who execute semi-improvised steps and foot tapping--or to choreographed groups of performers.  In my presentation, I draw on scholarly work, dance manuals, competition guidelines, and an interview with a malambo champion to explain how malambo "moves" are learned by imitation and practice and later developed individually using "flow" (inside/outside world sensations, memory, and intentionality) and personal ability (De Spain 2003).  I also discuss the improvised guitar/drum accompaniment associated with both malambo styles, use video footage to show how dance and music come/fit together in live performances, and address how malambo is judged at the Pre-Cosquín Competition for amateur talent.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Desde el momento que el antropólogo Alan P. Merriam escribió sobre la importancia de la enseñanza y el aprendizaje musical en la cultura, los etnomusicólogos han estudiado estos procesos para entender los sistemas musicales y cómo se transmiten/se cambian.  Aunque ya existen publicaciones dedicadas a algunas de las maneras formales e informales de aprender música en EE.UU. y otros paises (e.g., en los conservatorios y en el jazz), queda mucho por hacer--especialmente con la música popular--en Latinoamérica.  En el caso de la Argentina, ya hay algunos trabajos académicos escritos sobre la enseñanza formal de la música popular; sin embargo, no se ha investigado mucho todavía el aprendizaje semi-formal/informal del folklore musical--un tema fundamental porque el estudio formal del folklore no está al alcance de todos.  Una vía semi-formal muy común de aprender el género allá es participar de las oportunidades ofrecidas por la Comisión Municipal de Folklore de Cosquín:  el Certamen Pre-Cosquín, el Festival Nacional de Folklore (los espectáculos callejeros, las peñas, etc.), el Festival de la Canción y el Cosquín de Peñas.  Por medio de estas actividades es posible recibir comentarios "técnicos" y artísticos de los jurados--que siguen el Reglamento de la Comisión--para perfeccionarse; tocar en público; escuchar/conocer a otros músicos; ganar algún premio; grabar; y ver cómo es el "sistema" para llegar al escenario mayor y triunfar.  En esta ponencia, muestro cómo es el rol actual de la Comisión en cuanto a la fomentación del folklore musical argentino y la formación de nuevos valores y qué espera hacer la Comisión en el futuro.  Analizo también el aprendizaje semi-formal/informal en Cosquín a base de trabajo etnográfico realizado entre 2004 y 2009:  entrevistas hechas con participantes/organizadores del Pre-Cosquín, miembros de la Comisión y jurados; observaciones personales; y la experiencia de haber trabajado como veedora.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this presentation, I discuss the tension between collective access and the need for companies and artists to financially benefit from copyright royalties in Argentina, a topic I have become acquainted with while writing my 2001 book about cuarteto music and my recent one about Argentina's Cosquín National Folklore Festival.  In my comment, I stress the gap between theory and practice in the country and the many contradictions involved.  Although a variety of copyright regulations do exist in Argentina, the situation is a problematic one for academics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Much has been written in the international media about Argentina's "Dirty War" (1976-1983), a time when the country's military junta and leaders attempted to wipe out leftist guerillas, "subversives," and political activists thought to be dangerous. Human rights abuses (e.g., "disappearances," torture, and murder), the trial and eventual pardon of those in power, and the weekly marches of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo have all been widely covered.  Repressive measures began as early as 1973, when ex-President Juan Perón returned to the country from exile, and continued during the rule of his wife Isabel (1974-1976).  Much less has been written about either the short or long term influence of this period on musical genres and festivals in Argentina, some of which were censored, regulated, and/or banned.  In this paper, I discuss the consequences of the "Dirty War" and the repressive years preceding it on the Cosquín National Folklore Festival, the major musical event of its kind in Latin America, and the Municipal Folklore Commission (MFC), the institution that produces it.  Drawing on information gathered from archives, the MFC, and singers/ensembles involved, I address issues such as Festival intervention in 1974, attempted Festival cancellation in 1975, imprisonment of MFC organizers, government edicts passed regarding Festival production, censorship of song lyrics, blacklisted artists, and persecution/exile/death of performers.  I also explain how the "Dirty War" and prior years of repression are said to have permanently changed the evolution of Argentine folk music, especially the art of song writing, to this day.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The interrelationship of tradition, modernity, and identity in Latin America, a process which has long been misunderstood, has played a major role in the sanction of music and dance performed at Argentina's Cosquín National Folklore Festival since its creation in 1961.  Participants who have wanted to preserve Argentine national sentiment and the Festival's essence have supported traditional music and dance styles, whereas modernists have preferred updated versions based upon them ("projected folk music" and "stylized dance").  Although these issues of authenticity have affected the coming together of music and dance-- an important topic little addressed by ethnomusicologists--in many aspects of the Festival, only two cases are highlighted in this paper.  I first discuss the attempt of the Municipal Folklore Commission, which plans the Festival, to define both traditional and "stylized" dance in the Rules and Regulations of its related Pre-Cosquín Competition for amateur talent through codification of the music required to accompany each; video examples provide clarification.  I then address the dilemma of how to best present the music and choreography of the "Hymn to Cosquín," the Festival anthem.  Traditionalists have objected to changing the original musical version of this work and the dances prescribed within, but modernists have attempted to introduce new elements, such as tango.  The novel rendition of the "Hymn to Cosquín" at the Festival in 2005 is used to illustrate how tradition, modernity, and national identity can be negotiated through the relationship of music and dance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the National Folklore Festival held in Cosquín, Argentina, the relationship of tradition, modernity, and identity so present in Latin America is manifested through music:  a conflict exists regarding what "musical folklore" is and thus which genres, styles, and musical instruments to permit.  Some involved think that "authentic" folklore is only the most traditional type, but others believe it includes modernized folk/popular music.  By means of this aesthetic controversy, Argentine identity is negotiated.  Cosquín Festival organizers want to preserve "authentic" national culture yet at the same time permit originality of creation in folk/popular music and dance amidst globalization and the arrival of other musics, ideologies, and technologies.  The Pre-Cosquín Competition for new talent, held the two weeks prior to the Festival proper each year, carries out this objective:  2500 semifinalists from over 50 regional centers compete to earn the right to perform at the Festival and be named the Festival's "Revelation."  In this paper, I explain what is being done to negotiate the confrontation of musical values in the Pre-Cosquín Competition process.  Data are based on fieldwork done with Festival organizers, Pre-Cosquín jury members (criteria used), participants, and the experience of having served as a Pre-Cosquín Festival inspector. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>En el Festival Nacional de Folklore que se realiza en Cosquín, Argentina, se manifiesta por medio de la música la relación entre la tradición, la modernidad y la identidad tan presente en Latinoamérica.  En dicho evento, hay un conflicto de opiniones en cuanto a lo que es el "folklore" musical y por ende los géneros, estilos e instrumentos musicales que habría que incluir.  Algunas personas involucradas piensan que el folklore "auténtico" es solamente lo más tradicional (con guitarra criolla, bombo, etc.), pero para otras incluye la música de proyección folklórica y la música popular.  Por medio de esta polémica estética, que aparece en muchos aspectos del festival, se negocia la identidad argentina.  El objetivo de Cosquín es preservar la "auténtica" cultura nacional ante la globalización y la llegada de músicas, ideologías y tecnologías de otros lados.  A la vez, la Comisión Municipal de Folklore, que organiza el evento, quiere "promover y afianzar la identidad cultural argentina a través de la autenticidad y la originalidad de la creación en la música y la danza folklórica y/o popular argentina" (Reglamento 2004: 1).  Una de las vías más importantes para realizar este objetivo es el Certamen Pre-Cosquín para nuevos valores.  Se proyectan a los ganadores hacia circuitos artísticos nacionales e internacionales como representantes del arte popular argentino.  En este trabajo, doy ejemplos específicos de cómo se manifiesta esta polémica estética en Cosquín y sus implicaciones para el futuro del Festival.  La ponencia está basada en trabajo de campo realizado con organizadores del Festival, fundadores, jurados del Pre-Cosquín, músicos, el pueblo coscoíno y la experiencia personal de haber trabajado como veedora.  Explico lo que está haciendo la Comisión Municipal de Folklore para negociar esta confrontación de valores musicales y para construir y preservar la identidad nacional argentina por medio de la música.   </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the various incarnations of Orson Welles' unfinished Brazilian project, It's All True, a pseudo-documentary that studied racial and class politics manifest in the cultural ritual of Carnival.  It's All True represents the furthest step in a concept Welles had been exploring for some time: documentary fiction.  His merger of politics and fiction while filming, however, resulted in the tragic drowning of a Brazilian national hero.  His film, too, became submerged in studio reluctance and red-tape, and parts of it were literally thrown into the ocean </Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1937, Orson Welles was a respected young performer/director associated primarily with the New York theater.  By December of 1938, he had secured one of the most lucrative film contracts ever granted to a young writer, director and actor from RKO studios in Hollywood.  During this single year, Welles devoted himself primarily to radio performance, developing his radio series First Person Singular, later to become sponsored by Campbell's Soup and retitled Mercury Theater on the Air.  Two concepts were central to this radio series: first-person narration, and adaptation of classic literature.  Welles excelled at a performance style that positioned his voice as the conduit for adaptation, a recognizable guide for the listener through a literary experience deemed "classic" by its association with Welles.  The first-person approach placed Welles in the school of American star directors, or auteurs, but his consistent interest in the adaptation of literature written by others troubles the concept of auteurism, which often demands that the director be seen as a primary author of the text.  Studying Welles's radio plays as they relate to his cinema projects suggests that one of our most famous film directors was deeply indebted to radio for his unconventional notions of "text," "author," and "audience."  Welles's genius was one of cultural adaptation and media manipulation, twin strategies which he articulated through a first-person narrator. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Orson Welles's exploration of the line between fact and fiction, most famously exhibited in his 1938 Halloween War of the Worlds broadcast left two very different entertainment legacies.  First, the broadcast offered a template for how to forge collective American identity through media-projected fear.  But the broadcast had a secondary impact as well—to help foster an emerging distrust of broadcast media itself.  Radio in 1938 occupied a similar rhetorical spaces to that of television today in the American imagination.  Both act as media sources that Americans turn to for reliable, real-time information about the world outside their homes, but these media sources are sources of both tricks and treats for the American public. Increasingly, misleading the American public by media manipulation, which was regarded as dangerous and transgressive in Welles' era, has become a common political strategy.   This paper will suggest that Welles' experimentation with the line between fact and fiction—a theme often explored in his cinema work-- originated in radio broadcast and reflects a postmodern concept of erosions of the "real."   In an era of seemingly unbelievable political events, it appears the entertainment values hyperbolically matched social values.  That is to say, Welles became adept at representing the disorienting state of modern consciousness as it evolved toward postmodern disorientation.  His characters often represent the inability to construct any single "truth" when it comes to personal or public history.  </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Before there was Citizen Kane, there was Orson Welles the radio persona, the creative director and star of the show Mercury Theatre on the Air, which gave us the infamous War of the Worlds Halloween broadcast, and which also left behind many more radio adaptations of famous texts. Each of these radio broadcasts offers significant insight into Welles' emerging adaptation strategies, as well as his methods of negotiating between commercial sponsors, audience expectations, and his own creative expression, all of which are key to understanding his emerging cinematic style. This paper studies the controversy over a 1939 Orson Welles radio broadcast of "Liliom," the Molnar tale that formed the basis of the later musical adaptation, Carousel.  The Liliom controversy lasted from August to November of 1939, during which time Welles had to defend his creative freedom against attempts at censorship by religious organizations and commercial sponsors. The controversy centered on representations of scenes of heaven and the afterlife, and Welles felt frustrated and yet intrigued by the challenge of bringing it to broadcast—enough so that it influenced an initial proposal for a film about the Life of Christ to RKO. The "Liliom" controversy tells us much about the process of generating mass entertainment in this era, and the role that commercial sponsors, religious organizations, and the media played in the creation of Welles' creative vision.  The controversy also illuminates what was not deemed controversial at the time--namely the graphic depiction of domestic violence.  </Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the last decade, scholars of the Renaissance have turned their attention towards the materials used by artists to create their beautiful and much-studied work, as well as the trade networks that valued and circulated these materials.   This article draws on material from the archives of the well-known late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century merchant Francesco di Marco Datini from Prato, using in particular the little-studied ‘valute' or  valuation documents made by Datini agents or hired appraisers in numerous cities around western Europe and the Mediterranean.  It uses these documents to explore a number of issues in relation to Datini's involvement with trade of materials for artists including:  how would Tuscan merchants such as Datini have viewed these goods?  To which cities would he have turned for their supply?  What might they tell us about overall networks during the period?  An understanding of the way in which colouring materials came into Italy, were processed, and arrived on the artists' palette lays the vital groundwork for our understanding of both painters' attitudes to their materials as well as the reactions of their viewers and audiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We describe here in detail our work toward creating a dynamic lexicon from the texts in a large digital library. By leveraging a small structured knowledge source (a 30,457 word treebank), we are able to extract selectional preferences for words from a 3.5 million word Latin corpus. This is promising news for low-resource languages and digital collections seeking to leverage a small human investment into much larger gain. The library architecture in which this work is developed allows us to query customized subcorpora to report on lexical usage by author, genre or era and allows us to continually update the lexicon as new texts are added to the collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We describe here a method for automatically identifying word sense variation in a dated collection of historical books in a large digital library. By leveraging a small set of known translation book pairs to induce a bilingual sense inventory and labeled training data for a WSD classifier, we are able to automatically classify the Latin word senses in a 389 million word corpus and track the rise and fall of those senses over a span of two thousand years. We evaluate the performance of seven different classifiers both in a tenfold test on 83,892 words from the aligned parallel corpus and on a smaller, manually annotated sample of 525 words, measuring both the overall accuracy of each system and how well that accuracy correlates (via mean square error) to the observed historical variation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We present here a method for automatically projecting structural information across translations, including canonical citation structure (such as chapters and sections), speaker information, quotations, markup for people and places, and any other element in TEI-compliant XML that delimits spans of text that are linguistically symmetrical in two languages. We evaluate this technique on two datasets, one containing perfectly transcribed texts and one containing errorful OCR, and achieve an accuracy rate of 88.2% projecting 13,023 XML tags from source documents to their transcribed translations, with an 83.6% accuracy rate when projecting to texts containing uncorrected OCR. This approach has the potential to allow a highly granular multilingual digital library to be bootstrapped by applying the knowledge contained in a small, heavily curated collection to a much larger but unstructured one.</Abstract>

While the far larger works of Hesiod and Homer (142,705 words) have been annotated under a standard treebank production method of soliciting annotations from two independent reviewers and then reconciling their differences, we also put forth with Aeschylus (48,198 words) a new model of treebank production that draws on the methods of classical philology to take into account the personal responsibility of the annotator in the publication and ownership of a "scholarly" treebank.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper discusses the main issues encountered in the design of domain ontology to represent ancient literary texts that survive only in fragments, i.e. through quotations embedded in other texts. The design approach presented in the paper combines a knowledge domain analysis conducted through semantic spaces with the integration of well established ontologies and the application of ontology design patterns. After briefly describing the specific meaning of "fragment" in a literary context, the paper gives insights into the main conceptual issues of the ontology design process. Lastly, it outlines the overall architecture of protocols, services and data repositories which is required to implement a digital edition of fragments based on the proposed ontology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper discusses new work to represent, in a digital library of classical sources, authors whose works themselves are lost and who survive only where surviving authors quote, paraphrase or allude to them. It describes initial works from a digital collection of such fragmentary authors designed not only to capture but to extend the ontologies that traditional scholarship has developed over generations: the aim is representing every nuance of print conventions while using the capabilities of digital libraries to extend our ability to identify fragments, to represent what we have identified, and to render the results of that work intellectually and physically more accessible than was possible in print culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The folklore of French- and Creole-speaking Louisiana is composed of many influences that reflect the diverse cultural landscape of the region. In the field of folklore, the linguistic barrier has posed problems of accessibility and accuracy of analyses. Earlier work (Bascom, Abraham) presented these tales exclusively in English translation and simply as part "Southern folklore". On the other hand, francophone scholars (Ancelet 1994, Rabalais 2015) have focused on the repertoire in the context of the greater francophonie.  This presentation questions the prevalence of a folklore "pantheon" consisting of a handful of figures in popular representations, children's books, cultural festivals, etc. I argue that characters, especially the Rougarou and Bouki and Lapin, have enjoyed increased popularity over recent years because they are easily identifiable and similar to figures already present in American folklore (i.e. Werewolf and Brer Rabbit). Moreover, a survey of available collections (e.g. Fortier, Saucier, Claudel, Ancelet) indicate a much more varied cast of animal characters without a clear affinity for a few specific figures. This line of questioning can shed light on the specificity of Louisiana's French and Creole folklore, the interplay between French Louisiana and mainstream American culture, and the status of folklore's place in the popular imagination today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Small fields of research, such as Coptic Studies, bring challenges: Few departments have specialists. Resources with established funding structures are rare.  Individuals produce valuable text editions, but in print or heterogeneous digital editions. Complex morphology (e.g., in Coptic, word forms containing verbs and objects) make quantitative work and search difficult. Additionally, due to colonial history, many Coptic texts are unpublished, fragmentary, or dismembered (in different libraries around the globe).  Coptic Scriptorium brings cultural heritage resources online in machine readable and open formats to address these challenges. This paper demonstrates how the project's collaborative annotation tools and natural language processing tools leverage interdisciplinary methods to produce open corpora for research and cultural heritage preservation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Coptic Scriptorium is an interdisciplinary project dedicated to the digital and computational study of Coptic Language and Literature. The last phase of the ancient Egyptian language, Coptic was prominent in Egypt during the Roman and early Byzantine periods and is important for research in Religious Studies, Linguistics, Biblical Studies, Papyrology, Classics, Egyptology, and other fields. This presentation will introduce the project and goals, demonstrate the tools and technology available for researchers, provide an overview of key aspects "under the hood" that go into making the project, and assess challenges in this kind of work. We will end with a summary of future directions in the project and an invitation for researchers to get involved.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With the increasing availability of wordnets for ancient languages, such as Ancient Greek and Latin, gaps remain in the coverage of less studied languages of antiquity. This paper reports on the construction and evaluation of a new wordnet for Coptic, the language of Late Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic Egypt in the first millenium CE. We present our approach to constructing the wordnet which uses multilingual Coptic dictionaries and wordnets for five different languages. We further discuss the results of this effort and outline our on-going/future work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This conference addresses the connections between consciousness, free will, and the sense of agency. The conference brings together researchers from various disciplines, including, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, sociology, and medical history, to present and discuss a range of perspectives: (i) empirical and conceptual questions concerning the neural correlates of consciousness and intentional action; (ii) the theory of mind debate and the varieties of consciousness; and (iii) the implications of empirical data on folk intuitions about agency and moral responsibility. Contributions from cognitive neuroscience focus on the dynamic regulation of perception and cognition by memory and attention, and on the neural mechanisms that underpin anticipation and choice. Contributions from philosophy address the conceptual problem of other minds, embodied cognition and the extended mind thesis, and the phenomenology of moral experience. And contributions from medical historians and sociologists examine the impact that disorders of consciousness and a diminished sense of agency can have on the health and well-being of vulnerable groups in low- and middle-income countries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper argues that in Guatemala and Chiapas, by the late colonial period marriage and nuclear families were in fact central to native social structures and experiences.  The analysis focuses especially on the processes of household formation, tribute, and migration.  It shows that households were registered in censuses based on monogamous marriages and nuclear families.  Marriage was also a basis of the tribute system; native marriages were embedded both in the laws that regulated tribute and in the tribute amassment and collection practices within native communities.  Finally, the paper draws evidence from censuses and judicial cases to depict outmigration from native communities.  The evidence suggests that although long-term migrants sometimes left their nuclear families behind, more often they did not.  People migrating into the colonial world generally wanted to keep their spouses and children with them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the course of a project to transcribe and translate the lyrics of central Javanese gamelan music, it became clear that something highly unusual was going on in the way some of the texts were being used. Indeed, the lyrics of a typical gendhing (gamelan piece) represent an extreme, among the world's vocal musics, of fragmentation and discontinuity. Moreover, many of the texts are difficult for the average listener to understand because of their heavy doses of archaic words and their subtle word play, made all the more incomprehensible by melisma, the surrounding thick instrumental texture, breaths taken mid word, and the aforementioned fragmentation. In traditional gendhings, it is usually impossible to summarize what the words are "about": not only are they not tied to the music—singers can choose whatever texts fit the appropriate poetic meter—but a huge proportion of them are only there for the sound or in order to set up a riddle. Santosa (2001:375), in his study of the role of gamelan music in certain villages of central Java, while emphasizing that competencies vary, says, "[a]mong ‘ordinary audiences' texts can mean the rendering of syllables or even the ‘noise of vowels' because the ‘literal meanings' are not significant to some of them." In other words, the audiences in question heard texts as absolute music, devoid of propositional or even semantic content. And yet, gamelan lyrics contain some of the most beautiful, evocative poetry in the Javanese language. The following questions arise: What role do these lyrics play? Why do singers emphasize correct pronunciation, if meaning is unimportant? Why are certain texts overwhelmingly favored over others?  Santosa. 2001.

		<Abstract>This paper analyzes British children's fiction and nonfiction from 1800 to 1860 about global trade and political economy, exploring early representations of economic justice in children's literature. I identify popular authors who engage children in ethical debates over what kind of economic activities are mutually beneficial for producers and consumers. Children's books by Maria Edgeworth and Jane Marcet (the "mother of political economy" who inspired Harriet Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy (1834)), and children's manufacturing tour books by Isaac Taylor (the brother of poets Jane and Ann Taylor) represent cooperation as the happy result of competition and the division of labor, using personal gifts and face-to-face conversation to humanize capitalist exchange. Concurrently, Robert Owen and the Cooperative Society developed radical education curricula for children that rejects capitalist competition, developing the principles behind the Fair Trade movement.  My research investigates these competing visions of cooperation using Marcet's Willy's Holidays (1836), with children's articles from Cooperative newspapers, obtained with research from the Nation Co-operative Archive in Manchester. I call particular attention to representations of global and local trade, and gender, class, and race in labor contexts. Scholars have previously assessed literature by Charles Dickens, Charlotte Tonna, Harriet Martineau, and Elizabeth Gaskell about industrialization and political economy. My approach, however, places children at the center of these ethical debates—as readers and consumers, but also as children who worked alongside adults to produce goods for trade.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In my talk, I will describe the project website for the Heraion currently under development (2018–2019) with the support of an NEH/Mellon Fellowship for Digital Publication. First, I have "flattened" the monument into raster imagery embedding depth information, thus retaining the 3D data while compressing the files to about 100th their original size. Second, the temple is represented in a series of orthographic plan and elevation views, which has been the norm for architectural study and publication. The goal is not to develop an experiential, game-like environment—that through simplification deletes the vast majority of the original 3D scans—but rather a comprehensive research platform for understanding the architecture of the Heraion in detail. An interactive environment built on mapping technologies will enable visitors to pan and zoom around visualizations of the remains, even with limited bandwidth. During the talk, I will present a preview of the site, comment on the underlying technologies, and consider the advantages and disadvantages of this new method for architectural presentation and study.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As a classically trained studio artist and draftsperson who has also adopted photogrammetric recording in recent years, I am concerned at how digital recording is changing our ability to perceive, investigate, and communicate our findings about a monument. I will consider the impacts in particular on my recent work at the temple of Hera at Olympia (2013–2018), which relied exclusively on 3D recording. I argue that the technological efficiency of photogrammetry offers some solutions to the potential loss of close-looking and introspective research, although not necessarily those often promoted in current discussions of new technology. I also suggest that photogrammetrists should continue to activate the valuable eye-hand-mind pathways induced by traditional drawing, although they must make several deliberate choices in how they spend their time in order to do so. Overall, I am optimistic that the field of ancient architecture will blossom as it integrates an exceptionally powerful and potentially revolutionary new recording tool that allows researchers, on the one hand, to reassess to the original remains of an ancient building with immense speed and clarity, while on the other to rethink architecture at greater scale and with more creativity than could possibly be conceived just one decade ago.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Air Manchuria: the Army Behind the Mask Kathryn Meyer, Wright State University  In 1932 the Japanese sponsored government of Manchukuo created a civilian airline--the Manchuria Aviation Company. Although commercial in nature, Japanese Imperial Army personnel were instrumental in its creation. It functioned as logistical backup to the initial military operations as Manchukuo expanded its boundaries in the years leading up to the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Its pilots were military trained. They flew scouting missions, brought supplies to battlefields, removed the wounded, developed aerial photography techniques, and ferried opium to finance military adventure. The company also promoted its commercial operation at a time when few civilians flew. Articles in the company's in house monthly magazine, Man Ko describe the experiences of the early days of flight. In doing so the entries reveal the concerns of those creating a new nation. Themes of Manchukuo boosterism and modern Japan versus exotic China come across in the many descriptions promoting air tourism. This paper will examine the rhetoric of modern tourism and Manchukuo nationalism used by the journal even as the airline made its money from military support operations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>in cooperation with Greg Sarris, the Chairman of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, and Victor Temprano, the Canadian creator of the social media resource Native Land, I received an NEH grant to begin creating what we hoped would be an outward facing, resource of many nations.  Among the features of this resource in progress are a Google earth depiction of the continent with regions and names of Indigenous nations, a directory of research and tribal resources and resources for children, and the groundwork for telling the story chosen by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria—the story of first contact with the Pomo and Miwok and the reclamation of that story by the establishment of a monument at Drake's Landing in northern California.  In this talk we will discuss the first year of creating a prototype of MIAC-LH, and discuss options for collaboration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1936, Orson Welles' Federal Theater Production of Macbeth went on national tour with an integrated cast and crew of 100 African and African American dancers, actors, and musicians. The first stop was at the Texas Centennial Celebration, which commemorated Texan independence from Mexico. The production was documented by Exhibition General Manager and National Urban League officer Jesse O. Thomas, who framed the Centennial and its Hall of Negro Life as an important moment in black history.   The 1936 Texas Centennial Macbeth is rarely referenced in either the context of Welles' career or as a major moment in African American theater. This presentation seeks to rectify an important omission from African American performance history by studying the  unique performance context of the Centennial for the 1936 Macbeth, directed by Orson Welles.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A 1977 photo of "The Sisterhood," a writers' group in New York in the late 1970s that included June Jordan, Toni Morrison, Ntozake Shange, and Alice Walker has circulated as a source of inspiration since it was first published in 2004. This paper tells the story of a research journey from that photo to my book manuscript, The Sisterhood and Black Women's Literary Organizing.  Taking my project as a case study, I consider the possibilities and challenges of engaging archives of contemporary African American literature. This paper describes a number of Black Feminist research methods including simultaneously constructing and using archives, engaging Black women writers across genres as theorists, rendering women's work visible, and grappling with loss.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Looking ahead to the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment, Professor Robyn Muncy of the History Department offered a senior seminar in the spring semester of 2019 (History 408W: Votes for Women in Maryland! ) with an unusual assignment. The students were to write biographies of obscure Maryland suffragists for possible inclusion in Women and Social Movements in the U.S., an online subscription resource. (The UMD Libraries subscribe.) Because the women concerned are obscure, such a task would have been virtually impossible until fairly recently, but the digitization of many primary sources has greatly increased the possibilities in this kind of research. The course presented an excellent opportunity for close collaboration with the Libraries. UMD librarians and curators held two sessions for the course. In the first, Eric Lindquist and Doug McElrath showed how digitized newspapers and digitized census records could be used to create surprisingly rich pictures of even the obscurest of suffragists. In the second session, the class met with Ashleigh Coren in Hornbake to be introduced to other resources that would help them. The collaboration between course and Libraries might continue beyond the spring. The Libraries' Special Collections and University Archives are planning an exhibit on women's activism to mark the centennial of the 19th amendment, and some work arising from the course might be included.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jemmy (James) LaRoche made his London theatrical debut at Lincoln's Inn Fields in late December 1695 in George Granville's The She-Gallants. Specializing in the theatrical music of John Eccles, LaRoche appeared in several entertainments, singing intricate lute ayres and duets. In late 1697, LaRoche was cast as an itinerant Savoyard in Peter Motteux and Eccles's Europe's revels for the Peace of Ryswick, in which he sings a simple and repetitive ballad-style tune whilst exhibiting a portable cabinet of moving figurines and curiosities. LaRoche's tune, "Raree Show," is quite different from the previous songs assigned to him. Simplistic and limited in range, it approximates a street performance by an untrained musician—in other words, LaRoche was meant to sing badly.   After Europe's revels, evidence of LaRoche's performing career with Betterton disappears. While musicologists Katherine Lowerre and Amanda Eubanks Winkler have examined the contextual history of Europe's revels and Restoration theatrical music, little research exists on juvenile performers from this period and the circulation of their music.  Using performance studies as a theoretical frame, I examine the extant music written for LaRoche and the afterlife of his "Raree Show" tune. While musicology often privileges an ideal text or a perfectly rehearsed performance, it is vital to remember that failure was a hallmark of the seventeenth century soundscape and theatrical experience. By attending to evidence of "bad singing" and marginalized performers in early modern England, we can reconceive the networks of musical circulation, performance practices, and "illegitimate" theatrical spaces of seventeenth century London.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines Marita Bonner's Chicago stories that begin in 1933 with the serialized "A Possible Triad of Black Notes" and culminate with "One True Love" (1941). More specifically, I argue that Bonner's portrayals of Frye Street women upend narratives of domesticity and respectability that characterize New Negro women's literature. In this way, Bonner anticipates the transition to social realism that was embraced by Alain Locke and further promulgated by Richard Wright in his "Blueprint for Negro Writers" as well as his fiction. Wright, among other mostly male social realists, was preoccupied with how racism and class oppression impacted black men. Hence, social realist fiction often depicts the representative and "authentic" black urban subject as a proletarian male. However, Bonner's focus on black women workers broadens the "narrow orbit" Wright affords black northern women and privileges black women as urban subjects. Bonner's representations of urban black womanhood signal the postwar fiction of Ann Petry and Gwendolyn Brooks, whose female protagonists also moved in and throughout the streets of Harlem and Bronzeville.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) opened in the fall of 2016, it contained among its trove of artifacts an object called Ashley's Sack. This singular item of African American material culture is displayed in the Slavery and Freedom gallery of the museum. My comments for the plenary session of MLA's Textual Transactions themed conference will focus on this seed sack and its stories. In my preliminary and exploratory interpretation of this rare and beautiful thing, I will address how we have characterized the experiences of enslaved black women through a reliance on slave narratives as our principle texts and raise questions about how our understanding might change and expand if we looked for and spent time with different kinds of textual testimony. My talk will explore what counts as text, how we might read the stories of enigmatic textual things, and how certain things – particularly textiles – are tactile carriers that prompt extraordinary transactions of emotion, meaning and memory.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While historical documents are common sources of digital humanities collections, many digital projects still do not use controlled terminologies to represent their content and aid search, discoverability, and use. There are often pragmatic reasons for this. The art of identifying appropriate descriptive terms is a valuable skill. Unfortunately, too few DH projects have access to information specialists who can index their documents for them. We are addressing these challenges with the Nineteenth-Century Knowledge Project, an ongoing initiative to create the first standards-compliant digital version of historical editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica. The sheer scale of the project precludes human indexing, because it would take an estimated six-to-eight years to read through all of the entries. Instead, we use an innovative method to add automatically generated content metadata using linked open terminologies and the HIVE-approach. This method has allowed us to experiment on the optimal controlled vocabulary to use for indexing historical documents. Our presentation will focus on the results of this experiment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As political scientists grapple with how to understand and explain the rise to power of self-identified populist movements around the globe, we argue that the role of conservative, religious, and/or non-feminist women—understudied in the field as a whole—becomes ever more critical as a lens to understand and explain how populist movements come to power. Much of the research on the politics of conservative, religious and/or non-feminist women has been pioneered outside the discipline of political science. We argue that gender scholars of political science—in particular those who are studying the role of women in populist movements—have much to contribute to our theoretical and empirical understanding of the rise, and the effects, of populism in global and domestic contexts. In fact, we would argue that these phenomena cannot be adequately understood or explained without attention to the role of women in such movements. To address this gap, this roundtable brings together scholars doing leading-edge research on issues of substantive representation of religious, conservative, and non-feminist women across a range of countries and regions, all of which have experienced the recent (within the last five years) electoral success of populist movements, and/or have grappled with right-wing populist political movements and discourses holding significant sway in their political landscapes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The alarming rise of conservative populist movements in democracies around the world raises critically important theoretical and policy questions for scholars of women and politics. Gender scholars have much to contribute to our theoretical and empirical understanding of these dynamics in both global and domestic contexts. Because the participation of women lends an air of legitimacy to such movements—and an air of empowerment to women—it is urgent to understand the role of women and gender in populist movements. The role of gender and elections in Asia remains underexplored as a lens through which to understand these global political trends.   In India, the growing participation of women in the BJP has correlated with increasing electoral success of the party. But as the descriptive representation of women in the party has grown over time, we do not know how if at all the party's stances on women's issues (substantive representation of women) have changed, and how they have aligned (or not aligned) with the priorities of feminist scholars and activists in India. A key part of the BJP's strategy to incorporate women involves challenging feminist claims to represent Indian women and their interests. This paper thus seeks to explore whether and how the descriptive representation of women in religious nationalist politics in India corresponds to changes in the substantive representation of women, and to feminist positions on the substantive representation of women. Have the BJP's stances on women's issues changed as women have become increasingly incorporated into the party? How do the BJP's positions on women's issues differ from or correspond to feminist positions?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>By late 1619, 15 of the first 25 enslaved Africans imported into British North America were laboring at Flowerdew Hundred, a thousand acre plantation on the James River in Virginia. They joined indentured Europeans, neighboring Weanock Indians, and elite European landowners in shaping the mid-17th century expansion of plantation settlements across the Chesapeake, an expansion which led to the emergence of a tobacco plantation labor force comprised almost entirely of enslaved Africans and their descendants by 1700. Since the 1970s, archaeological research at Flowerdew has produced hundreds of thousands of artifacts and dozens of linear feet of unbound field records and maps. A new project led by the Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery (www.daacs.org) is re-analyzing collections from four of the earliest and most significant 17th-century archaeological sites at Flowerdew. We describe the protocols used to parse these documents into a relational PostgreSQL database that allows us to directly link legacy field data to related artifacts, images, and maps. We also illustrate how the standardized digital data produced by DAACS will enable students, scholars, and the public to advance our understanding of the multicultural dynamics behind the emergence of a slave society in British North America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Podcasting is just over ten years old as a media form and practice, but it has ushered in an explosion of amateur and professional cultural production. There are now over one million podcast feeds in over one hundred languages. There's a podcast on almost every subject imaginable, from popular shows like Serial and Radiolab to lighter fare like the wrestling podcast Wrestlespective or shows that cover a social issues like sexuality, identity, race or politics (e.g. Strange Fruit, This Week in Blackness, etc.). We are in the midst of what many are calling a "Golden Age of Podcasts"; a moment where the choice for quality digital audio abounds, and where new voices and new listeners connect daily through earbuds, car stereos, or office computers. The audience keeps growing as well, exceeding 60 million American listeners last year.  Yet despite the excitement over this vital media form, and despite the plethora of content being produced, the sounds of podcasting's nascent history remain mystifyingly difficult to analyze. There are few resources for anyone interested in researching the form, content, or history of podcasts and even fewer tools for preserving and analyzing the sonic artifacts being produced during this golden age of audio. What today's podcasters are producing will have value in the future, not just for its content, but for what it tells us about audio's longer history, about who has the right to communicate and by what means. We may be in a "Golden Age" of podcasts but if we're not making efforts to preserve and analyze these resources now, we'll find ourselves in the same conundrum many radio, film or television historians find themselves: writing, researching and thinking about a past they can't fully see or hear.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Podcasting's increasing popularity has resulted in a number of distribution platforms seeking to incorporate podcasting into their content offerings. While podcasting used to be largely delivered through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed subscriptions via software like iTunes or mobile apps like Overcast, digital content distributors like Spotify and Google have begun including podcasts as part of their streaming offerings. Some, like Spotify, have even commissioned original podcasts available exclusively on their platform. On the one hand, these seem like relatively innocuous business strategies; content providers want to provide listeners with popular audio content, so they add podcasts to their services. However, the inclusion of podcasts as part of streaming services that also include music, audiobooks, and other audio content represents a significant infrastructural shift for podcasting; a shift that may make it harder for lesser-known and niche podcasts to stand out in these spaces.   Using data from a large podcast database, PodcastRE (http://podcastre.org), this paper examines the role open technologies like RSS and XML play in creating a vibrant environment for audio and investigates the logics streaming services deploy for podcast display and discovery on their platforms. The Spotification of podcasting, I argue, may represent a welcome push towards more user-friendly and mainstream consumption of podcasts but, in the process, might threaten the very format these companies hope to popularize. In other words, podcasting may be more ubiquitous than ever but visibility may not equal diversity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper documents one effort to save these new sounds: a database I have been building called PodcastRE (short for Podcast Research). Currently the site (http://podcaster.org) tracks over 1300 podcast feeds, and indexes and stores over 250,000 audio files, along with all the associated metadata from the RSS feeds. The web interface allows users to search the database via keyword (e.g. title, author, description elements, etc.). There are also several thousand interactive transcripts which allow users to find specific keywords within individual episodes (e.g. Election, ISIS, Hamilton, etc.) and narrow their search results accordingly.  The database raises a number of significant challenges regarding saving and researching digital audio. There's the incredible inconsistency of podcast metadata, which comes via both RSS feeds and the ID3 tags within the audio files themselves, both of which depend on which platform hosts the podcast and which program was used to created it. There's also the instability of the object itself…podcasts are no longer static audio files like they were in podcasting's early years. Technologies like dynamic advertising and dynamic insertion mean that the audio file itself can change periodically over time. Beyond these technical questions, there are the more serious cultural questions the database raises about what to save (which voices, which sounds) and how to go about doing so; it's easy to automate scraping the most popular podcasts but sourcing the more marginalized more independent shows is a much more manual affair.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite an explosion in popular interest in digital soundwork (e.g. podcasts, internet radio) and increased academic attention to the study of sound (e.g. Sound Studies), sound itself remains mystifyingly difficult to analyze. The challenges of both qualitative and quantitative audio analyses mean that sound remains far less usable than textual resources. Fortunately, podcasting creates new opportunities for archiving, discovering, and analyzing audio content. This paper reports on an on-going project I am developing, called PodcastRE (http://podcastre.org) to create a searchable, researchable database of podcasts for media studies and communications scholars interested in the practices, politics, and potentials of podcasting. This web-based database of podcasts currently allows researchers to conduct key word searches within over 250,000 podcasts at the feed and episode level. It allows for macro analyses of general characteristics (e.g. show length, producer affiliation, topic, date and other metadata) and will eventually include the ability to visualize search results. Given the lack of metadata standards for podcasts, the dynamic nature of audio files, and the ephemerality of expired links and RSS feeds, I argue podcasts are ubiquitous yet highly vulnerable cultural artifacts. Despite these challenges, I researchers to turn their ears towards this media form; to consider sound as scholarship and what might be possible when such a large collection of audio culture becomes analyzable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What does it mean to represent—visually and textually—a people who are unconvinced of their own agency and indeed humanity within the postcolonial world as they feel victimized by ensuing civil wars and political unrest in their nations? In this paper, I focus on Amir and Khalil's Zahra's Paradise and Hamid Sulaiman's Freedom Hospital, two graphic novels set in Iran and Syria respectively, each addressing a range of issues related to human rights—from free speech to the policing of values and morality under theocratic and/or totalitarian regimes, from torture to state-sanctioned murder. Focusing on the disappearance of a protestor after the fraudulent elections of 2009, Zahra's Paradise follows one mother's quest for justice. This emblematic story, weaving fact with fiction, illustrates the chaotic environment in which the Green Revolution has led to a "major purge of reform-oriented individuals" by the authoritarian state, using Islam as a façade to legitimize its power. As one reviewer puts it, as Zahra moves from hospital to courtroom to prison to cemetery, she is "confronted with doublespeak worthy of Orwell and confounded by a labyrinthine bureaucratic nightmare worthy of Kafka." Freedom Hospital also features a woman, Yasmine, who navigates between different militarized fractions fighting for the control of her town as she tries to build a hospital. The war-torn territory forms the backdrop of panels that feature faceless, nameless figures – casualties of war – scattered across the pages. Suleiman also makes a point of giving a count of the dead on each passing day before he embarks on a new story line. Both works focus on people trapped in a state of exception, attempting to work out how to respond to their chaotic environment as humans—even when their positive rights are violated so severely that, in Hannah Arendt's words, they face "expulsion from humanity altogether."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper pursues a comparative analysis of two graphic novels set in the Arab world that engage with violence and unrest: Sherine Hamdy's Lissa (2017) and Hamid Sulaiman's Freedom Hospital (2016). Hamdy's Lissa sheds light on the Egyptian uprisings against government corruption by focusing on the friendship between an American and Egyptian girl. In Freedom Hospital, Sulaiman takes the reader through the contested territories of the Syrian revolution as various military operations create an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Cultural translation remain at the heart of both works as they explore how to communicate and thus educate the "West" about the banality of violence, as marked, for example, by the number of dead on each page in Freedom Hospital. The suspension of law and therefore the transformation of the citizen to bare life not only point to the collective traumatic experienced by those who remain trapped within repressive regimes, but also show the futility of human rights discourse in war-ridden territories. Santesso ends her paper with a discussion of how the two texts represent visually people who are unconvinced of their own agency and indeed humanity within the isolated, insulated worlds they inhabit.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talks focusses on the discourse use of the nominal classification system of Secoya (Western Tukanoan, ISO: sey), as spoken in Peruvian Amazonia. The hypothesis at play is that Secoya has a single but complex classification system. The data examined here suggests that the language has concurring subsystems that complement each other, in the sense of Gomez-Imbert (2007), Seifart and Payne (2007), and Fedden and Corbett (2017). Secoya, as many other languages in the world, has formal mechanisms to organize nominal referents following three semantic parameters: animacy, biological sex, and shape. Animacy, refers to the degree to which entities are capable of human-like volition behavior (Silverstein 1976). Gender is a complex socio-culturally constructed classification on the basis of biological differences between males and females (McConnell-Ginet 1988). Shape includes dimensionality, axial geometry, curved/straight edges, negative spaces, and orientated axis, properties that play a crucial role in object recognition, visual processing, and language acquisition (Seifart 2005). In Secoya, these three semantic parameters have ramifications in grammatical subsystems. They have their own markers, their own loci, but share the functional load.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper reports on the achievements of VHL's work during the first  two years of its existence, as a platform for collaborative research in the humanities  Authors discuss two components of  the editing process as they envision it (encoding and annotating): as a form of interdisciplinary and collaborative knowledge work. Namely, they discuss issues raising from their experiment with subjective (or "idiosyncratic") text encoding; the challenges they face in organizing the work of an international group of collaborators and the procedures for their collaboration; the process of annotating and indexing large texts collaboratively; finally, they hint at the potential applications of VHL work for pedagogical purposes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Few analytic philosophers have more effectively freed Anglo-American aesthetics from correspondence theories of truth than the late Nelson Goodman.  Contrary to mainstream analytic discussions of "artistic truth" prior to 1968, Goodman insists that art has important cognitive functions and questions whether science is the paradigmatic field of knowledge.  He also rejects propositions as truth bearers and doubts that correspondence governs cognitive functions.  By wresting "representation" and "expression" from the grip of correspondence theories, Languages of Art gives these concepts an insightful new account.  This paper summarizes Goodman's account and examines the alternative theory of truth it implies.  The paper argues that, while freeing aesthetics from propositionally inflected correspondence theories, Goodman misconstrues artistic import and overlooks the intersubjective dimensions of artistic truth.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nicholas Wolterstorff's Works and Worlds of Art regards mimesis or "fictive world projection" as "pervasive and fundamental in the arts."  On his theory of fictive world projection, what the artist presents can be true to actuality, but it can not be true about anything.  The paper suggests that this theory gives art cognitive status without cognitive substance.  It recommends instead that asserted propositions not be considered primary bearers of "truth-about," and that artistic import not be equated with propositional content, thereby eliminating the motivation for distinguishing between "truth-to" and "truth-about."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Let's start on Wednesday, December 26, 1900. We're at the Garden Theatre in New York City. William Dean Howells is there to watch Sarah Bernhardt play Hamlet, and finds himself deeply pained by it. After running through a long inventory of points of evidence for the failure of her performance—wrong line readings, flattened dramatic arcs, a bad wig—he moves to a generalizing mode in which he concludes that women just should not be playing Hamlet. "The strongest reason against any woman Hamlet," he declares, "is that it does violence to an ideal. . . in a true civilization such a thing as that Hamlet would be forbidden, as an offence against public morals, a violence to something precious and sacred." How had things gotten to such a point to where Hamlet had become precious and sacred, an object of idealization, that women and other interlopers would want to claim for themselves, and that critics would become apoplectic fighting to keep their own interpretation?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Explores how the non-linear and non-hierarchical aspects of reading that have been identified as a unique dimension of digital texts, particularly hypertexts, have always been present in how readers have processed print texts. Draws on the growing emphasis in Shakespeare studies over the last 25 years on text variants and the concept of revision in Shakespeare to make this point. Specifically uses the materials presented by visiting scholars and teacher participants in the 2004 NEH Summer Institute to document this perspective on digital and printed texts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Description and analysis of domestic units, reporting on the excavation of Archaic houses (6th–early 5th century B.C.) in 2002-2005 at Azoria in eastern Crete. Five houses are discussed: four on the South Acropolis on the periphery of the civic center, and one on the North Acropolis. Well-preserved floor deposits provide evidence for room functions and permit a preliminary analysis of domestic space. The houses fill a lacuna in the published record of the 6th and early 5th centuries and contribute to our understanding of the form of Archaic houses in the Aegean and the integration of domestic space into an urban context.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The increasing prevalence of digitized source material in the humanities has led to uncertainty about how this suddenly available information will change scholars' research methods. What balance will scholars strike between in-depth examination of a few sources, and a more "distant reading" (Moretti 2005) of a large number of them? Our focus is specifically on text collections: comparing texts, and identifying and tracing patterns of language use. These tasks are not widely supported by any current software, but if humanities researchers want to use digitized text collections on a larger scale, they will need to do exactly such things.  We restrict ourselves to a particular collection: the North American antebellum slave narratives, written by fugitive slaves in the decades before the Civil War with the support of abolitionist sponsors. Scholars agree about the slave narrative's most basic conventions but it is likely that these narratives, with their extreme repetitiveness, may also manifest other regular features that have yet to be detected by scholars. This project aims to assist literary scholars in uncovering these patterns with computational techniques.  In collaboration with English scholars, we have built WordSeer, a system that can compare two or more narratives' grammatical features, and analyze the distribution of textual patterns throughout an entire collection. Our goal is for English scholars to be able to use our system to gather accurate information about language use patterns in a way that is intuitive, and natural to them.  We will present the system currently under development, and share the lessons we have learned while building a text exploration interface for use in the humanities. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Increasing numbers of primary and secondary source texts in the humanities have been digitized in recent years. Humanities scholars who want to study these new collections in depth need computational assistance because of their large scale. We have built WordSeer, a text analysis tool that includes visualizations and works on the grammatical structure of text extracted using highly accurate off-the shelf natural language processing tools. We have focused on the task of exploring language use patterns in a collection of North American slave narratives, but the technique is applicable to any text collection. Our preliminary user studies with humanities scholars show that WordSeer makes it easier for them to translate their questions into queries and find answers to their questions compared to a standard keyword-based search interface. In this paper, we present the system currently under development and describe text analysis features we plan to include in the next iteration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Some philosophers, the 'anti-individualists,' believe that all fundamental facts are purely qualitative. They could in principle be stated without mentioning any specific individual by name. Other philosophers, the 'individualists,' believe that the fundamental facts also include facts about which individuals exist and how the qualitative properties and relations are distributed over them. Anti-individualists are committed to the idea that all facts supervene on the qualitative facts. I argue that that thesis yields implausible consequences in the theory of chance and counterfactuals. Ultimately, individualism carries the day.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thomas Reid's account of the faculty of taste uses a perceptual model to explain how normal humans apprehend aesthetic qualities.  Reid's aesthetics is most well known for being an example of an expression theory of art.  On Reid's view, material objects possess aesthetic qualities in a merely derivative sense: they possess qualities that signify – and thus express – excellences of mind.  The secondary literature on Reid's aesthetics has focused a great deal on Reid's expression theory, in particular on whether it is inconsistent with his anti-subjectivism about aesthetic qualities.   The controversy surrounding this putative inconsistency has centered around the issue of whether Reid holds that aesthetic qualities are primary or secondary qualities.  I argue that Reid's views about the ontology of aesthetic qualities are unlikely to solve the puzzles that arise from the combination of an expression theory with anti-subjectivism.  They are unlikely to do so for three reasons.  First, Reid devotes little attention to the primary/secondary quality distinction, and the superficiality with which he treats it indicates how poorly suited the traditional distinction is to his overall views.  Second, one need not appeal to the distinction in order to resolve the tension between expression theory and anti-subjectivism.  Beauty and grandeur are properties of subjects, but this does not entail that they are subjective properties.  Third, one need not appeal to the distinction in order to explain Reid's account of the perception of aesthetic properties, the expressive powers of material objects or the objective status of beauty and grandeur.  To do this, one must appeal to the details of Reid theory of perception, including his anti-sensationalism and direct realism.   </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Eighteenth-century philosophers were split on the question of whether brute color can be beautiful.  Some, such as Addison and Burke, explicitly included color within the realm of beauty while others, including Hutcheson and Kames, succumbed to what George Dickie has derided as "the great, eighteenth-century, philosophical, color-blindness plague."  This paper asks what reasons could ever be offered to adjudicate this conflict.  On what basis might we decide that colors either can or cannot be beautiful?  I argue that eighteenth-century authors often drew their boundaries around beauty with one thought in mind: how the resulting category of the beautiful would affect morality.  Lacking this kind of extrinsic rationale, recent accounts of aesthetic experience have struggled to offer principled reasons for drawing the boundaries of the aesthetic where they do.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Hume is plausibly interpreted as asserting that an artwork is beautiful if and only if it pleases ideal critics. Jerrold Levinson maintains that Hume's commitment to this biconditional gives rise to a problem that neither Hume nor his any of his interpreters considers: the problem of explaining why you should care what pleases ideal critics if you are not one yourself. I argue: (a) that this problem arises only if you hold an empiricist theory of aesthetic value (i.e., a theory that reduces the aesthetic value of a work to the value of the experience it affords), as Levinson does; (b) that Levinson's own solution to the problem cannot succeed; (c) that Hume's commitment to the biconditional is not a commitment to an empiricist theory of aesthetic value but to an empiricist theory of aesthetic evaluation; and (d) that Hume does not consider Levinson's problem because it does not arise for him, given that his theory of aesthetic value is not empirical (in the present-day sense) but primitivist.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the 21st century, how best to relate the history of the National Park Service's Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, the most popular historical attraction in the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area and a major archaeological site, with more than 1 million visitors per year and 2 million artifacts to show?  With digital stories told via mobile devices.    This talk, focuses on the "Fort Vancouver Mobile," an NEH-funded project that brings together a team of 18 experts and scholars from throughout the digital humanities field -- including historians, archaeologists and academics specializing in digital media production as well as literature, rhetoric and writing -- to tell the story of the fascinating and multicultural history of the place once dubbed the "New York of the Pacific."  Specifically, the presenter will discuss the way design and non-fiction historical writing come together when mobile devices are used for digital storytelling.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper investigates evidence from excavations at the site of Azoria for an abrupt phase transition or punctuated change occurring roughly in the transition from the 7th to the 6th centuries B.C. The paper reflects on evidence of urbanization from excavated contexts at the site of Azoria, suggesting that the analysis of the construction of the city center itself informs our understanding of patterns of changing intra-site relationships; both indicate an abrupt change in the agricultural economy, in which new contexts and practices of food production and consumption, in the late 7th and early 6th centuries B.C., were of central importance in ordering social, and by extension, economic and political relationships in the Archaic city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this presentation, I study Rosa Cuchillo (1997), by prominent indigenous-mestizo writer, Oscar Colchado Lucío. This novel, narrated by three indigenous characters, portrays the inability of both the Shining Path guerrillas and the state to understand indigenous Andean culture. By channeling the therapeutic processing of the conflict through Andean characters and epistemologies, Rosa Cuchillo suggests that one possible outcome of Peru's internal conflict could be a cultural, if not political, Pachacutec—an Andean revolution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Continuing excavation on the South Acropolis at Azoria in eastern Crete has exposed buildings of Archaic date (7th–early 5th century B.C.), which served ostensibly public or civic functions: the putative andreion complex on the upper west side of the peak, and the Monumental Civic Building and its adjacent Service Building on the southwest slope. This paper discusses the results of excavations of Late Archaic levels within these buildings, providing details of their forms, and allowing us to characterize dining and ritual practices, and important differences in patterns of food production and consumption. The results show extensive evidence in both buildings of communal feasting, the provisioning of food, and the integration of cult activities.  The economic and sociopolitical implications of public feasting are discussed in the context of evidence for centralized storage and scaled-up production of certain foods such as olive oil, which is represented by a lever-beam press. Community integration and civic identity are reflected in both buildings, but in different ways. The Monumental Civic Building encouraged a communal feast in which status distinctions were probably emphasized through the nuances of rituals and perhaps ceremonial allocation of sacrificial meat or special meals. On the other hand, the separate and segregated dining rooms within the andreion made it possible for participants to dine together, but separately; to be part of the civic community, while at the same time expressing corporate or kinship distinctions. The nature of the ceremonies and feasts in these two civic contexts suggests distinct but parallel modes of interaction and expressions of sociopolitical identity in the early city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One aspect of urbanization in the Aegean at the end of the Early Iron Age (ca. 800-600 B.C.) is the nucleation of population—settlement aggregation and the restructuring of social, political and economic landscapes, giving rise to Classical Greek cities and city-states. This paper presents a case study of an excavation of one such early emergent center, the site of Azoria on Crete (700-500 B.C.), examining patterns of agropastoral production and consumption in specific contexts (domestic and communal) of emerging public and civic institutions and buildings that mediated social and political interaction and formed mechanisms of community organization and integration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Excavations conducted by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens at the Archaic site of Azoria in eastern Crete (Hesperia 73 [2004] 339-400; 76 [2007] 243-321, 665–716) have recovered evidence for centralized olive-oil production associated with a large civic meeting hall. The results of work conducted during two study seasons (2007 and 2008) now permit the detailed reconstruction of olive storage and stages of olive-oil extraction in a two-room industrial building destroyed in the early 5th century B.C. One room was evidently used for storage of olives in pithoi, while the other, for various stages of processing: crushing, pressing, and oil separation. Evidence in the main room consists of a crushing block and basin; a hearth; sockets for three wooden press beams; a stone press weight, and fragments of two press beds apparently dislodged from a bench. The presence of olives, an oil-separation jar and mortar in adjoining store rooms; crushed olive in the main press room; and oleic acid residue on the press-bed fragments corroborate the architectural evidence. Our understanding of olive-oil extraction in the Aegean comes principally from vase painting, and prehistoric or 4th century and later contexts (Margaritis and Jones 2007; Foxhall 2007). The only known Archaic findspot in the Aegean is Klazomenai (Koparal and Iplikci 2004), where little actual equipment has survived the fourth-century reoccupation. This paper thus presents the most detailed archaeological evidence to date on Archaic olive-oil processing within the context of food production for public consumption in an early Greek city.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper reports on excavations in 2006 that exposed stratigraphy demonstrating that in the mid-to-late 7th century a sociopolitical change had occurred on the site involving or instigating a deliberate break from the Early Iron Age past and its five century-old patterns of occupation. The stratigraphic work in 2006 sheds light on this abrupt transition, and has shown the potential of refining the date of a critical threshold of culture change. Furthermore On the southwest slope of the South Acropolis the southern end of a large building of Late Geometric date was recovered that appears to be an Early Iron Age hearth temple.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over 50 years after the "Thrace Events" in Turkey (1934) a Jewish émigré describes the violence he experienced: "For a certain time in all the part where we used to live, it start(ed): anti-semitism, and they want(ed) to kill all the Jewish people to deport them at that time in (1934). Hitler time. We escaped…." Remembering the boycotts and violence against Jews in Thrace through an arguably post-Holocaust narrative of Nazi anti-Semitism, this informant's account contrasts sharply with recent scholarship forging a link between such local violence and the Settlement Law (also 1934) that reflected wider state security interests targeting not only Turkish Jews, but also Muslim minorities such as Balkan immigrants and Kurdish tribes in the east. Effectively silent about the Turkish state's role in the violence, the informant draws attention to a normative public and scholarly narrative about Jews as protected minority in Turkey, as well as the association of anti-Jewish violence not with Turkey, but with Nazi Germany. What is significant about such divergent stories of the state and how can they illuminate historiographies that take shape and circulate in a variety of venues as ‘public history'? Drawing upon oral interviews with older Turkish Jews in Istanbul, Izmir and Edirne, this paper will explore the effective and real silences in their testimonies for what they can tell us about wider neighborhood, national and interethnic contexts, as well as the degree to which they undergird commonplace historiographies of the nation and academy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Yahgan, an isolate language of Tierra del Fuego, has one of the largest known systems of verbal number marking, with some 50 suppletive singular/plural root pairs and hundreds of other roots marked for plurality by a set of productive suffixes. Using published and unpublished materials collected by the 19th century missionary Thomas Bridges, and fieldwork with the one remaining fluent speaker, I will discuss the morphological strategies for marking Yahgan plural verbs. The existence of regular derivational morphology for marking number of the stem argues for interpreting the irregular forms as suppletive, rather than separate lexical items.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Much of the modern philosophy of causation has been governed by two ideas: (i) causes make effects inevitable; (ii) a cause is something that makes a difference to whether its effect occurs. I focus on explaining the origin of idea (ii) and its connection to (i). On my view, the frequent attempts to turn (ii) into an analysis of causation are wrongheaded. Patterns of difference-making aren't what makes causal claims true. They merely provide a useful test for causal claims. Moreover, what justifies us in using them as a test is idea (i). That's how (i) and (ii) are connected.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This roundtable proposes to shift our understanding of modernist "structures of innovation" through a focus on what Peter Middleton calls an "intersubjective network," e.g. the "author" considered as the crux of a number of social and aesthetic performances and institutions.  Mina Loy (1882-1966) provides our network:  a poet, novelist, painter, fashion designer, lampshade maker, and gallery agent, she lived in London, Munich, Paris, Florence, Mexico, and New York, associating with writers and artists connected to Art Nouveau, cubism, futurism, dada, surrealism, and abstract expressionism. With the conference theme in mind, the roundtable will position Mina Loy as the center of a "structure of innovation" as a means of illuminating that structure from an altered perspective. Each participant will consider Loy in relation to a particular visual artist, movement, or institution in the visual arts, with the aim of using this connection to engage larger questions about gender and sexuality, the relationship between different media, and the history of the avant-garde. Although Loy is our starting point, we do not consider this roundtable a "single-author" conversation;  rather, Loy's work and connections to a variety of avant-garde movements will help us to map new constellations of artists, and to generate new ways of thinking about modernism and visual culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The discourses of tradition and modernity in the Muslim world have overwhelmingly focused on issues of gender and Islamic law, which have been perceived among the highest stakes in policy choices and cultural representations.  Modernity has been understood in this context in terms of greater legal rights for women.  Starting in the 1950s and ever since, Tunisia has implemented gender legislation expanding women's rights in family law. As a result, it has been at the forefront of the Arab world in regard to progressive legislation.  This paper first examines the meaning ascribed to the concept of modernity in the social science discourse on the Middle East as well as in the political rhetoric.  It then documents major phases of reforms in favor of women's rights in Tunisia and outlines the conditions that permitted or encouraged the continuity over the last half century.  The first wave of reforms in the 1950s transformed the legal construction of gender roles within the family.  The second wave in the 1990s redefined the conditions for the transmission of Tunisian citizenship.  Current debates concern primarily inheritance. In painting social change in broad strokes, I analyze the initial and pioneering phase of the 1950s as a reform resulting from the actions of a newly formed national state interested in building a new society at the end of colonial rule.  By contrast, the role of women's agency came into play in Tunisia starting in the 1980s and became more robust in the 1990s.  The consequences of the recent 2011 Jasmine Revolution still have to be explored. The evidence suggests that different political configurations can be conducive to reform and that the pursuit of modernity can be initiated by different social actors. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ever since the wave of decolonization from the 1940s to the 1960s, family law has been caught between the discourse of modernity and that of tradition in the Middle East.  A popular view in Western Europe and in America sees modernity as representing the model of the West and tradition as embodying the authentic values of Islamic society.  Arguing against binary representations, I suggest that these discourses should be treated as reflections of political struggles rather than as immutable expressions of culture.  As elsewhere, culture in the Islamic world is deployed politically and strategically.  Furthermore, the discourses of tradition and modernity are complex and replete with internal contradictions, as there are multiple forms of tradition and multiple forms of modernity.  The paper discusses how issues of family law have been formulated in the context of struggles for power and how law is invoked as a way of either respecting or counteracting tradition.  Political groups that take widely different stands on family law all appeal to Islam as the ultimate source of inspiration for their particular position.  Issues of law, culture, tradition, modernity, and gender become inextricably intertwined.  In an effort to disentangle them, the paper asks a key question of political sociology: who is served by the discourse of modernity versus tradition about the law?  We need to differentiate between the states and social groups that find it advantageous to use the discourse of "Islamic tradition" and those that find it more beneficial to advocate "modernity."  The paper concludes that questions of power have to be brought to center stage when we consider the discourses of tradition and modernity in regard to family law in the Islamic world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Taken from Chapter 1 of the book-in-progress, this essay means to show two primary things: (1) that autobiography emerged during 1830-1870 as an increasingly popular and profitable genre; and (2) that this rise in autobiographical production created, in turn, a deep cultural anxiety about the consequences of making identity into "portable property." Even earlier, in 1827, an anonymous writer for the Quarterly Review lamented Grub-street's "mania for . . . Confessions, and Recollections, and Reminiscences" since such texts demonstrated a new and appalling tendency for writers to market "the secret workings of their own minds." God willing, the writer never lived to see the remarkable proliferation of such narratives during the thirty years that followed. This essay will work partly by sharing the results of my archival study of Victorian autobiography in the mid-century market, and partly by showing contemporary reactions to this new tendency to convert identity into a commodity meant deliberately for purchase and sale. More important, I will also use this essay to gesture toward the argument that forms the basis of the rest of my book: that cultural anxiety about the growing tendency to commodify identity helped to produce by mid-century a new narrative sub-genre, Victorian sensation fiction, which seems almost invariably—in its simultaneous preoccupations with missing goods and divided subjectivities—to hinge upon the consequences of subjecting identity to the same rules of greed, ownership, and power as other forms of "portable property."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Taken from Chapter 1 of "Portable property" and drawn simultaneously from two periods of NEH-funded archival research and recent scholarship by Andrew Miller, Alexis Weedon, and others, this paper argues: (1) that autobiography emerged during 1830-1860 as an increasingly popular and profitable genre; and (2) that this transformation of autobiography created, in turn, a deep cultural anxiety about the consequences of making identity into "portable property" to be bought and sold in the market—an anxiety that plays out thematically and symbolically in the sensation novels of the 1860s. In the broadest sense, what I suggest in the book is that these two forms of literary "entertainment" are joined ideologically, and that sensation fiction emerged at least partly as a literary response to the underlying logic of increasingly commercial autobiographical writing. Locally, in this presentation, what I want specifically is to discuss the contours of autobiography's transformation into a commercial genre, and to articulate the cultural and theoretical meanings of that transformation. At its imaginative core, autobiography is a consequence of the literary calculus by which the intimate utterances of the author—indeed, the author herself or himself—become the consumable products of a capitalist age. In 1827, an anonymous writer for the Quarterly Review lamented the "mania for . . . Confessions, and Recollections, and Reminiscences" since such texts demonstrated a new and appalling tendency for writers to market "the secret workings of their own minds." In this essay, I will trace this "mania" and assess the cultural anxieties it engendered as Victorians weighed the implications of subjecting identity to the dangerous rules of ownership, exchange, and power that formed the basis of the increasingly mature capitalism of the Victorian age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this essay, I make two related arguments about Victorian autobiography, one rooted in book history and the other deduced from the consequences of this Victorian tendency to textualize and commodify the Victorian subject. First, using material I have drawn from periods of archival research at the British Library, the Bentley Archive, the John Murray Archive, and other resources, I demonstrate the ways in which Victorian autobiography emerged as a deliberately commodified genre of English prose. Second, working from contemporary reviews, Victorian legal culture, and post-modern theory, I argue that the emerging logic of subject-as-commodity produced crucial new anxieties as well as literary modes for their expression. The most important of these was sensation fiction with its incorrigible tendency to make missing wills, stolen jewels, and other "greed" plots return to problems of psychological fragmentation and the necessity of narrating and textualizing the self. At stake, as I will show, was the gradual collapse of the boundary between identity and property—a collapse that revised the Victorian notion of the subject according to the dangerous requirements of the market.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing from Chapter 1 of my current project, I argue in this paper that autobiography and sensation fiction alike proliferated at mid-century at least partly from a common cause: a Victorian legal culture that steadily redefined subjectivity as an object of profit and exchange. As I will show, autobiography "rose" during the first part of the Victorian period as a culmination of the logic inherent in copyright—a logic that insisted with greater and greater urgency that the identity of the author belonged intrinsically to the ink and paper of the text. Equally important, under the unfavorable copyright laws of the first half of the nineteenth century, many authors wrote autobiography for deliberately commercial reasons, appending "recollections" or "reminiscences" to their collected works in order to extend their rights of property in earlier publications. Even apart from copyright law—for instance, in the period's more vigorous census-taking, licensing and registry requirements, and creation of Civil Service examinations—Victorian legal culture tended overwhelmingly to locate the subject in the official written record that might be composed and to implicate it in the dynamics of a rapidly expanding commodity culture. By working through these facets of Victorian legal culture, my aim is finally to trace both autobiography and sensation fiction to a common ideological root: the legal invention of the subject as an explicitly commodified thing, vulnerable to textual and therefore economic incursions and consequently a fit emblem of the new capitalist age.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawn from my book-in-progress, this paper argues that the particular dynamics of textualization and subjection at work in Lady Audley's Secret originate in the strategies for commodifying femininity that emerged during the first half of the nineteenth century. Partly, as I will show, femininity came to be commodified through the extraordinary proliferation of autobiography during the first half of the century, since that proliferation tended broadly but inexorably to create a new relation between the subject and the rules of ownership and exchange. (Indeed, a working hypothesis for my book is that the proliferation of autobiography largely engendered the anxiety about identity that is invariably so prominent in Victorian sensation novels of the 1860s.) More particularly, as Lady Audley's portrait suggests, Braddon's novel returns also to the strategies by which the visual arts came to represent, contain, and ultimately commodify femininity, at once neutralizing and cashing in on the particular dangers of illicit feminine sexuality. What I argue finally is that Lady Audley's transformation into a textual thing in the novel—or, I should say, into several textual things—makes her eventual subjection to masculine power inevitable, and that this transformation finally belongs to a distinctly Victorian logic of textuality and the market.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing from the concluding chapter of my book-in-progress, I argue here that the Tichborne case offers a culminating "view" of this problem in the most significant sense of that word, for it played out spectacularly in the public spaces of Victorian courtrooms, legal papers, and the popular press, where it became tabloid fodder and even appeared as The Tichborne Romance for George Routledge in 1872, a year before the criminal trial began. The paper begins with a brief account of the Tichborne case and its emergence as a cause célèbre then assesses in detail the ways in which the case really put on display not just the opportunisitic fraud Arthur Orton but also a grosser Victorian monstrosity: the legal and cultural evolution of a Victorian subject inseparable and even indistinguishable from property, which became in turn—as earlier chapters on Silas Marner, Our Mutual Friend,  The Eustace Diamonds, and other works illustrate—a driving preoccupation for the mid-century novel.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The process of recreating the experience of hearing sermons at London's Paul's Cross has led to recognition that the early modern sermon was a collaborative experience, with both preacher and congregation participating in the process of sermon delivery. This has led to recognition of moments in Donne's sermons clearly designed to engage the congregation and to provoke response.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In June 2010, the University of Vermont (UVM) Libraries was awarded funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to support the Vermont Digital Newspaper Project as part of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) developed by NEH and the Library of Congress.  The UVM Libraries work collaboratively with partners at the Vermont Department of Libraries, the Ilsley Public Library of Middlebury, and the Vermont Historical Society to select, digitize, and make available up to 100,000 pages of Vermont newspapers published between 1836 and 1922, from the collections of the Vermont Department of Libraries and the University of Vermont.  The digitized newspapers will be made freely available to the public via the Library of Congress' Chronicling America database.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This forum offers a panel presentation, discussion, and question and answer period regarding (1) the VTDNP and Digitization in Vermont (Chris Kirby); (2) Framework for Grant Development (Birdie MacLennan); (3) Content Selection and Historical Research (Prudence Doherty); and (4) From Film in a Drawer to Searchable Online Content (Microfilm to Digital Conversion - Tom McMurdo.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This usage-based study deals with the nominal classification system of Secoya (Western Tukanoan, ISO: sey), as spoken in Peruvian Amazonia. It looks at the distributional properties of the classification devices with a focus on the semantic distinctions they encode, as wells as their functions in discourse. The data examined here suggests that the language has concurrent subsystems that complement each other (Gomez-Imbert 2007; Seifart &amp;amp; Payne 2007; Fedden &amp;amp; Corbett 2017). Secoya has formal mechanisms to organize nominal referents following three semantic parameters: animacy, biological sex, and shape. Animacy, refers to the degree to which entities are capable of human-like volition behavior (Silverstein 1976). Gender is a complex socio-culturally constructed classification on the basis of biological differences between males and females (McConnell-Ginet 1988). Shape includes dimensionality, axial geometry, curved/straight edges, negative spaces, and orientated axis, properties that play a crucial role in object recognition, visual processing, and language acquisition (Seifart 2005). In Secoya, these three semantic parameters have ramifications in grammatical subsystems. The distribution of subsets of markers can be predicted by looking at specific grammatical constructions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Languages throughout the world have dedicated mechanisms to specify information about the shape, animacy, consistency, size, location, or utility of the entities around us. An important question in linguistics is to what extent the nominal classification system of a language mirrors the way speakers see the world they live in, and to what extent the documented similarities reflect underlying, general cognitive processes in the human mind. Thus, an adequate theory of human language requires a broad sampling of diverse languages. Amazonian languages have been identified as a priority in this respect, since they are both poorly documented and highly endangered. This project investigates Secoya, an endangered Tukanoan language spoken in Peruvian Amazonia, and provides new bodies of data from unique settings. The concrete outcome will be a morphosyntactic and semantic account of Secoya's nominal classification system, situating the analysis in the broader Amazonian context. From a theoretical perspective, Secoya provides an excellent case scenario to test current typologies of nominal classification. There has been a traditional belief that the classification of entities can be achieved by either gender systems or classifier systems. Secoya has both gender and classifiers. This project will contribute to the development of a framework in which both systems can be analyzed together. Also, a better understanding of Secoya can shed light on language contact in Amazonia. Secoya is one of the few languages of the Tukanoan family that is outside of the well-known Vaupes linguistic area where several contact-induced processes are taking place. Secoya is particularly important to inform debates regarding the direction of influence among systems. More broadly, this project contributes to the documentation of imperiled cultural heritage, while also enriching our understanding of the diversity of the world's languages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bioethicists and humanistic researchers alike have long been concerned over the effects of unchecked industry money on biomedical cultures. Corporate-funded clinical trials, free lunches, free travel, and industry honoraria for scientists have been shown to adversely affect the integrity of biomedical research. Despite the broad recognition of these hazards, efforts to address them have largely been limited to disclosure requirements and related training. Current standards require clinical researchers to report certain conflicts of interest alongside published scholarship. Unfortunately, a growing body of evidence indicates that disclosure statements often result in unintended and pernicious effects. Ultimately, a significant shift in our understanding of conflicts of interest is required, and this is where the insights of digital humanities (DH) can be most beneficial. However, in order for this kind of theoretically-informed relational network modeling to be of use to humanities research, scholars need effective and efficient tools to transform the dense prose of disclosure statements, financial reports, or database outputs into useable visualizations. This is precisely what the Transparency to Visualization (T2V) tool is designed to do. Our toolkit combines natural language processing, machine-learning enhanced named-entity recognition, and regular expressions to create a script that "reads" biomedical disclosure statements for economic relationships and prepares extracted data for subsequent visualization. The proposed presentation will explain and demonstrate the toolkit while reflecting on how these kinds of resistant DH projects can contribute positively to issues of social concern.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The mottled landscape of pastoral and agrarian livelihoods in Inner Mongolia posed fundamental problems around governance for Japanese imperialists after they invaded Northeast China in 1931. Within this zone of mixed settlement, Japanese planners and Mongol collaborators pursued land reform to mark out a new border for an autonomous province within the client state of Manchukuo. The border continues to define the eastern limits of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to this day. This paper details the origins, implementation, and consequences of this reform, a law known as "The Mongol Land Offer," which expropriated the estates of indigenous princes beyond the new border and incorporated these territories into Manchukuo's county administration in 1938. Driven by Marxian analysis, Japanese researchers from the South Manchuria Railway Company reframed the nomadic pastoralism practiced by Mongols within feudalism in order to justify state dispossession of aristocratic property beyond the border. The Land Offer redistributed the extensive holdings of the Mongol nobility to predominantly Chinese tenants. Japanese leftists reworked Marxian theory to recognize the Mongol territories as a special case of feudalism, where not only class, but also livelihood lay as the cause of supposed economic stagnation. The data from Japanese surveys, generated in collaboration with indigenous partners, motivated land reform in the Mongol territories that predated Communist programs. This extensive classification project led to significant territorial dispossession, the curtailing of indigenous power, and ultimately the effacement of Mongol identity from the map of Northeast China.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the Mongol territories of northwest Manchukuo, a pastoral preserve grew beyond the political bounds of the Japanese occupation and the agricultural limits of the land. Indigenous leaders convinced Manchukuo authorities to ban further land reclamation on the steppe as way to "revive the Mongol race" through nomadic practice. The Five Year Plan of 1936, however, sought to eliminate the nomadic aspect of herding because its Japanese architects did not see seasonal migration as a "rational" use of resources. Rather, they viewed it as the root of overgrazing and land degradation on the steppe. These sweeping claims by the imperial state did the political work of motivating grassland protection policies to rearrange the livelihoods of herders. Casting native species as "degenerate," Japanese experimental farms began importing alfalfa seeds and Merino sheep whose intensive care required sedentary patterns of subsistence, subverting nomadic practice over time. The Japanese program to turn so-called primitive nomads into rationalized ranchers settled Mongols into ethnic enclaves, known as "concentration-villages," to produce meat, wool, and leather in industrial quantities for the empire. While the steppe would continue to look like the steppe, the Five Year Plan refigured an underlying ecology of transhumance into one of sedentary extraction. The fact that some Mongols were able to continue their migrations nevertheless points to the limits of Japanese rule in the nomadic borderlands.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The invasion of Indigenous land by Europeans led to the destruction not only of individual lives, belief systems, and connections with specific land regions in the United States, but also of art, architecture, and embodied cultural practices, including respect for gender orientation.  The destruction and diminishment of opportunities for the practice of Indigenous culture have heightened in the current political climate, but they continue to be met by resistance and, in the Indigenous term, "survivance."  One pathway of survivance in the face of political, corporate, and other institutional destruction is the preservation of forms of knowledge, art and material culture, and documents related to Indigenous histories.  Yet information and patrimony related to the distribution of Native American art and architecture, beliefs and ceremonial practices, and other cultural information is widely dispersed among tribal museums, natural history and art museums, private collections, regional and federal libraries, and digital archives. In this session I invite discussion of digital archives and other ingenious survivance strategies: existing archives and their efficacy, ethical issues related to "mapping" Indigenous communities (including critique), ideas for collaboration among existing archives, and visions of future digital or repatriation resources that would benefit Indigenous communities and historians.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The 1857 New York edition of the popular Ursuline Manual discouraged novel reading and plays as a "stumbling-block to [young women's] piety," yet in the last decades of the nineteenth century, a significant literary output, in the forms of short fiction and drama, were created by American teaching sisters for their female pupils. The origins of this paper lie in a seemingly simple question: how can the study of Catholic women religious help us research nineteenth century American Catholic childhoods? While scholars of Catholicism and education in U.S. have often focused on the "bible wars" of the 1830s and 1840s, as a historian of women and girls I have turned my gaze away from the fraught public school and towards the convent school and Catholic bookstore, sites where middle-class American Catholicism was made and re-made during a century of vast growth. If a growing mass market for English-language devotional books changed the way that nineteenth-century American Catholic laypeople thought about their place in a Catholic world full of saints and Sacred Hearts, sacraments and miracles, further analysis of the pages in which devotional materials were advertised makes clear that young Catholic readers encountered more than simply spiritual guidance on the page, but also texts that could forge multiple identities: fiction and nonfiction, magazines, reading guides, and children's literature. Based on convent school plays (published by the Catholic Publication Society and other New York firms) this paper explores the impact of the "sister-writer" and her oeuvre, performed and read in female academies during the last decades of the nineteenth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Along with uniting for and engaging in the overt politics of Samyukta Maharashtra Movement (United Maharashtra Movement in Western India of the 1950-60s), many women and men equally engaged in and pursued the interlocking discourse of constructing their own regional identity, sexual modernity, morality, civility, and legitimacy. What was the language and paradigms that Marathi elites used in their articulation of what it meant to be Marathi, scientific, progressive, scientific, rational, and modern? Why was it so significant? In order to prove that they were now fit to govern themselves in independent India and Maharashtra, Maharashtrians articulated the vernacular political discourse of shuddha (pure, sanitized), naitik (moral), samajik (social), laingik (sexual), and sanskrutik (cultural) contours of what it meant to be a new brand of shilvan (genuine, of good disposition) Marathi manusa. In so doing, they once again attacked ashlilta (vulgarity) and critically carved out their moral modernity in order to be legitimate Marathi. Drawing upon hitherto unexplored Marathi sources, including film magazines my paper examines middle-class Maharashtrian's wide range of attitudes, practices, social, and sexual anxieties regarding the appropriate boundaries of decency, vulgarity, sexuality, and conjugality, as they sought to carve out their Maha-rashtra (great nation)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper draws upon the figure of Dharmapuram Swaminathan (1923-2009), a singer of Tamil Saiva hymns (otuvar) who develops a massively popular style of singing that carves a new and deeply charismatic sonic and social space for the Tamil Saiva poetic canon in the twentieth century. She juxtaposes Swaminathan's rise to fame with the development of institutions such as the Tami? Icai Ca?kam and the popularity and circulation of devotional music through new forms of mass media, both of which were economically and politically enabling for figures like him.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Contest-based music and dance reality shows, as well as shows that partake of the reality TV aesthetic in different ways, have become a major component of television programming in South Asia since the mid-2000s. This panel will address the forms of value and legitimation, as well as of exposure and publicity, that are sought and generated through the affordances of the "reality" format and the small screen more generally. We address three sets of questions. First, reality shows are a complex combination of elaborate staging and the claim to present "reality." What new forms of performance and new values are generated in these shows, with their emphasis on visibility and liveness? How do the conventions of reality TV coincide with or contradict other modes and sites of performance? Second, what kinds of subjects (citizens, performers, contestants, judges, "experts," fans, audiences, etc.) are produced on and through these shows? How are social and political identities (e.g. caste, class, gender, religious community, nation) produced or elided? What forms of celebrity are emergent from these shows? Third, what regimes of vision and viewing are at work in these shows?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The white marble image at Triloknath Temple in Himachal Pradesh is considered to represent Shiva by Hindu visitors, and a special six-armed version of Lokeshvara Bodhisattva by Buddhists. Pilgrims from both faiths considered it a "self-arising" image, and so particularly powerful.Until relatively recently Triloknath was situated along one of the main routes connecting Zangskar, a predominantly Buddhist region of southern Ladakh, with Himachal and other regions of India. Over the past few years, Professor Linrothe has identified paintings, sculptures and photographs of the white marble image in its setting at Triloknath in Buddhist monasteries, a nunnery and in private shrines. Professor Linrothe will present evidence that there was a cult of this specific version of the deity at Zangskar, as well as a familiarity among Zangskaris with the particular iconographic form from much earlier (eighth to twelfth century) metal sculptures from neighboring Kashmir.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The study of Amarna's non-elite cemeteries provides an extraordinary opportunity to explore the social dimensions of ancient Akhetaten. While there is generally little variation in approach to burial across individual graves, at a broader level – between cemeteries, with respect of natural and urban landscapes, and with communities in mind – there exists considerable potential for social analysis. Six cemeteries for the general population of Akhetaten are known: huge ‘public' cemeteries and smaller ‘community' burial grounds co-existed, and varied in their relationships to landscape and to living communities, and subtle differences in approach to burial can be seen across them. One remarkable burial ground near the North Tombs contains up to 5,000 individuals, most under the age of c. 25, who were perhaps from labourers' communities, living separately. If so, they represent a portion of Egyptian society largely unattested archaeologically at Amarna or elsewhere: a hidden urban community. This paper forms part of an ongoing exercise in repositioning the Amarna cemeteries within their lived urban landscape. It will explore how cemetery research helps to make Amarna's urban communities visible, and the tensions between ‘the city' and the communities that served it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Excavations conducted in the Main City in the 1920s, the Workmen's Village in the 1970-80s and, since 2006, the Stone Village and four cemeteries for non-elite people, yielded thousands of fragments of textiles, testifying to the importance of the industry at Amarna, both in day to day life and in preparations for the afterlife. The study of the material excavated in the cemeteries, instigated in 2017, aims to better understand burial practice for non-elite people, by looking at the type of fabrics used and their roles in the processes of wrapping and mummification, if at all. Comparisons with textiles excavated in living areas of the city help to understand whether or not the same cloths were produced and used by the living and for the dead. In this paper, results of the study of the South Tomb Cemetery, the North Tomb Cemetery, the Stone Village and the North Cliff Cemetery textiles, including wrapping material and goods, will be presented, together with some conclusions concerning their possible way of production, use or reuse in burial context, in the light of items produced and found in the Workmen Village and the Main City.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A tantalizing question shadows ancient Amarna, the city built by Egypt's monotheistic king Akhenaten in the late 14th century BCE: did epidemic disease sweep through the ancient city? The suggestion is not without basis. The Amarna period coincides broadly with one of the most famous ancient references to an outbreak of disease, recorded in texts from the land of the Hittites in Anatolia, modern-day Turkey. The texts describe the Hittite capital as having been ravaged by disease, which is said to have been brought by captured Egyptian prisoners. This seminar will explore the evidence for an epidemic in the Amarna period, with particular focus on the ongoing excavation of the non-elite cemeteries of Amarna.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper draws on passages from the APWA in which incarcerated people describe the experience of seeing their personalities so changed by incarceration that the notion that incarceration is effectively retributive is placed in doubt.  Retribution assumes that the same person who was convicted of a crime persists inside carceral institutions.  If this continuum is broken, the retributive rationale may also break down.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The matter of this essay is a hat. Wearing a cap is so ubiquitous for Muslim males that i tpasses unnoticed, while veils on Muslim women attract inordinate attention. In recent scholarship by Emma Tarlo and Annelies Moorson Islamic dress,"fashion" speaks exclusively of women's clothing. They emphasize the  connection between aesthetics  and  ethics,  a  useful  theoretical reminder for this essay about men's caps. It discusses caps in general, and in specific will trace a single  distinctive  cap—the  one  that  I  wear  as  a  legacy  from my  Sufi  teacher  in  India,  a  cap  of simple design but complex symbolism. A Sufi cap does not merely display its wearer's allegiance to others. It also reminds its wearer—by the very pressure of its matter against his forehead—of the ideals of the Order to which he took vows.  These ideals are easily neglected because they urge one to forget oneself: the process of being reminded, whether by one's clothing or other skillful means, is the essence of dhikr, remembering God and thus being reminded of the nothingness of one's own mind. Purifying one's heart of the pollution of egoistic mind is grueling and difficult, and progress along its path is marked by backsliding as much as progress. Without love, there is little hope for success,for only passionately love can push us toward effacement. For this reason, the Chishti Sufis celebrate the cap that is awry, raised like a dome, peaked like a goal, cornered like a system, but tilted to show deference to beauty and love within the material constraints of this embodied world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bioarchaeological analysis of the human skeletal remains from the non-elite cemeteries of Amarna reflects a lived experience in diametric opposition to ideal lives often predicted based on representations of overflowing offering tables.  The Amarna Cemeteries project is a long-term, interdisciplinary project that seeks to utilize multiple lines of investigation to more fully understand the lives of the non-elite individuals buried in five cemeteries identified thus far.  To date, human skeletal remains have been analyzed from two of these cemeteries, the South Tombs Cemetery (STC; n=430; excavated 2005-2013) and the North Tombs Cemetery (NTC; n=194, excavated 2015-2017).  The two cemeteries differ in general demographic characteristic.  The STC reflects a normal ancient burial population, with representation of all age and sex groups in frequencies typical for bioarchaeological samples.  The NTC demography is much more restricted, with the vast majority of the individuals being young, 7-25 years old, and predominantly female.  Both of the cemeteries, however, reveal urban life was extremely difficult for the non-elite residents of Akhetaten.  Overwhelmingly, the skeletal remains show evidence of heavy workloads beginning early in life, dietary deficiency, and high frequency of infectious disease.  The cemetery profiles do not reflect the often speculated epidemic disease.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The North Tombs Cemetery (NTC; excavated 2015-2017) at Tell el-Amarna sits in a wadi along the northeast margin of the cliffs surrounding the ancient capital city of Akhetaten and was in use during the brief Amarna Period (c. 1349-1332 BCE).  Initial expectations were that this cemetery would be similar to the previously studied South Tombs Cemetery (STC), reflecting the larger population of the city.  The STC has demonstrated heavy workloads, poor nutrition, and rampant infectious disease were common for the non-elite at Akhetaten. Ongoing bioarchaeological analysis of the NTC (current n=194) subverts initial expectations and suggests a specialized, restricted labor force of young, predominantly female individuals.  94% of the sample is estimated to be 7-25 years old and adult females outnumber adult males by a margin of 3.5:1.  This young workers' cemetery reflects heavy labor very early in life and potentially more intensively than present in the STC.  Pathological lesions identified in the NTC include degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the spine (8%) and limb joints (15%), fractures of the spine (31%), evidence of nutritional deficiency (53%), and infectious disease (94%).  Comparisons between the rates of trauma suggest the NTC subadults experienced up to eight times more fractures than STC counterparts, with the youngest spinal compression fractures occurring as early as six years old.  The presence of spinal and limb DJD in individuals as young as 12 years old lends further support to the interpretation of the NTC as a specialized, highly biologically taxed workforce.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Wilfrid Sellars has often been thought to hold that all thought is a linguistic affair; isn't this his infamous ‘psychological nominalism'? Though it is clear Sellars thought that language is a necessary condition of conceptual thought, he never believed that thought is always linguaform. Furthermore, I argue here, he made explicit provision for phenomenologically rich non-linguaform episodes of thought. Sellars argues that we often think in color or in sounds or tastes. Unfolding Sellars' thought here entails examining his treatment of the imagination and its relation to both thought and sensation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This workshop brings together scholars and editors from the Society to provide attendees with information about critical editions and assistance with projects of their own. The first part of the workshop will feature a panel in which representatives from Recent Researches in American Music, Music of the United States of America, Sounding Spirit, and the George and Ira Gershwin Critical Edition will introduce their series and discuss the value of their scores to scholars, performers, and teachers. The second part of the workshop will consist of three simultaneous breakout sessions on different aspects of making a critical edition. One will focus on writing proposals, another will deal with issues that arise when working with archival materials, and the third will concern making a critical score. In these sessions, leaders will introduce the topic, share some of their experiences, and/or lead activities. At the end of the sessions, attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss their own projects with the leaders and other participants.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Understanding significant gospel, spirituals, and shape-note music songbooks from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries involves looking beyond text and music to paratextual elements ranging from music notation system to format and page dimension to evidence of use that are important markers of these works' cultural context. Yet most recent approaches to digital music editions, and digital editions generally, erase these markers of bibliographic form, centering new digital renderings of encoded music and text in the user's browsing experience. In this paper, I discuss the NEH-funded forthcoming series of digital critical editions of vernacular sacred American music books from 1850–1925, Sounding Spirit, which employs Readux, a new platform for annotating and publishing digital scholarly editions developed by Emory's Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS), which emphasizes books' bibliographic forms in their digital expression. Readux is a Django/Python application that builds on the Mirador image viewer and IIIF protocol to augment annotated digitized books with transparently rendered text in a seamless digital interface. By retaining bibliographical forms in digital (music) editions, new critical editions can better subject to analysis technologies of print that meaningfully express these works' contexts before and after the turn of the twentieth century, a time of great dramatic demographic and cultural change that shaped intersections of race, religion, region, and music in the United States. This presentation articulates the value of an approach to digital editions that centers cultural paratext through augmented facsimile and describes the Readux platform that enables Sounding Spirit to adopt this approach to digital critical editing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Lithic data have received sparse attention in research on the Franciscan missions of Spanish La Florida. We have attempted to correct this imbalance through our ongoing digital database project Cataloguing the Franciscan Missions of La Florida. This project involves a re-analysis of all of the collections (lithic and otherwise) from three seventeenth-century interior missions. Our study emphasizes the variability in tools and their manufacture both within and between mission communities. The research reveals that Timucuan Native Americans continued to rely on a diverse lithic technological tradition well after arrival of friars in their communities and the subsequent importation of metal tools. This persistence is also reflected in historical accounts where, for example, Native Americans were mandated to maintain quotas of arrows. Formal stone tool systems are manifested in the manufacture of bifacial projectile points and the unusual occurrence of a prismatic blade technology. A wide range of expedient flake tools was also an important component of the household. In addition to characterizing the lithic technologies on the sites, our presentation addresses the methodological challenges of developing an approach toward debitage analysis that allows for consistency between researchers with only modest experience in the study of lithic materials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The CMAP digital database will be made publicly accessible in the summer of 2019 via a free access web browser. Its development is funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities that is dedicated to building a web-based initiative to facilitate comparative archaeological research on mission sites. At this time, we are entering the data from three seventeenth-century Franciscan mission sites from the Spanish colony of La Florida.When entries are completed, approximately 60,000 artifacts will be in the database. There are a large number of attribute fields related to both qualitative and quantitative attributes of Native American and European ceramics, stone tools and debitage, and a variety of artifacts of European origin that include religious, architectural, and personal adornment objects. Pictures of modal artifact types as well as unusual or noteworthy objects also are included in the database. Supplementary information includes historical background on missions, histories of archaeological investigations, and excavation protocols.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1897, Franz Boas published what became one of the most influential books in the field of anthropology: The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians. The collaborative product of Boas's own observations and extensive materials authored by his long-time Indigenous co-worker George Hunt, the text was the first systematic attempt to document all sociocultural, spiritual, and aesthetic aspects of a spectacular Native North American ceremonial structure.  This session presents the work of a collaborative project between scholars, Kwakwa_ka_'wakw researchers, the U'mista Cultural Centre, and international repositories to create a new critical edition of this founding document in anthropology.  The goal of the project is to examine the book's hidden histories and complex legacies in order to re-envision Kwakwa_ka_'wakw participation in the original research, to reassemble globally distributed collections and fragmented archives, and to create a critical historiography of the book. While clearly articulating the historical and political contexts for early anthropology, we are also recuperating long-dormant ethnographic records for use by the Indigenous families whose patrimony is represented in them. Academic and community team members will discuss Boas and Hunt's main sites for conducting "fieldwork" (communities in British Columbia, the Chicago World's Fair, and museums in North America and Europe); the primary media they utilized (museum objects, texts, photographs, and wax cylinder recordings); the conditions of, and the specific participants in, their research; and the legacy and contemporary use of the 1897 book in Kwakwa_ka_'wakw communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Long after his death, Marco Polo's Travels twisted through the era of early modern European exploration. During the sixteenth century, Polo became Italians' most fundamental reference point for travel, as well as their most important eye-witness to foreign lands. Even after firsthand accounts of global exploration began to fill Italian libraries, many continued to cite Polo as the definitive source on global geography. Remarkably, a great variety of maps, images, and texts grafted Marco Polo's visions of Asia directly onto the Americas. This talk will explore the myriad ways in which Polo framed Italian understandings and representations of the New World, which for many Italians, was just another part of Polo's Asia. To embrace Polo during the first global age meant reflecting and constructing powerful and lasting visions of an Amerasian continent in which the old informed the new, and in which America overlapped with and extended from Asia. This understanding of global geography interwove the legacies of Polo and Columbus and lasted well into the seventeenth century.</Abstract>

Between its first and last volumes, the James K. Polk Project found lots of letters that belonged in earlier ones. What to do with them? Expectations of digital publication differ for volume 14, in 2019, from those for volume 11, in 2009—to say nothing of volume 1, in 1969. How to reconcile those? And how can editors incorporate a subject's death into a series that has always focused on that subject's life?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>James K. Polk, the eleventh president (1845–49), exercised a principled commitment to religious freedom. Amid widespread animosity toward the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, he provided moral and financial support to Mormons journeying from Illinois to Iowa to the Salt Lake Valley. Wanting them to identify as Americans, he ordered the formation of a battalion of Mormons to help fight the Mexican-American War. He also appointed Jesuits to minister to U.S. soldiers and to assure Mexicans that the United States was not waging war on Catholicism. When a Presbyterian clergyman criticized him for those appointments, he labeled the man "a bigotted fanatic" and "told him that, thank God, under our constitution there was no connection between Church and State, and that in my action as President of the U.S. I recognized no distinction of creeds" (Polk, diary entry of October 14, 1846). An independent believer and a devotee of Thomas Jefferson, Polk retained in a prejudiced age the third president's liberal political philosophy toward religion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The goal of the conference is to assess the current state of T‘ang studies and to encourage new avenues of research and collaboration among scholars of medieval China.  Response to the call for proposals was enthusiastic, and the selection of papers for presentation was based both on the quality of the individual proposals and on the need to create panels of papers on related topics that fit with the themes of the conference.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nearly three decades of archaeological research at The Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's plantation just east of Nashville, has made it one of the most thoroughly excavated sites of slavery in North America.  Until recently, the vast quantities of recovered artifacts remained unanalyzed.  With funding from NEH, The Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery has made accessible archaeological data from nine domestic units once home to enslaved laborers.  Here we use correspondence analysis of ware-type frequencies, mean ceramic dates, and frequency seriation to provide for the first time an accurate chronological sequence for the occupation of The Hermitage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ceramic assemblages from slave-village sites on islands in the eastern Caribbean are often dominated by locally-made ceramics, dubbed by archaeologists "Afro-Caribbean ware." This paper offers an initial attempt to advance our understanding of these ceramics, based on samples from shovel-test-pit survey of three village sites on Nevis and St Kitts.  We use INAA to assess the compositional distinctiveness of assemblages from different villages and address the question household production.  We also track changes in the frequency of   Afro-Caribbean wares, relative to imported ceramics, from the mid- eighteenth century to emancipation and their implications for changes in market participation.  We highlight the critical role played by statistical methods in deciphering the larger historical meaning of these ceramics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars have long recognized the crucial role of internal markets in the slave societies of the New World. This paper uses archaeological evidence from Jamaica, Nevis and the Chesapeake to assess local patterns of change and variation in the roles that markets played in enslaved peoples' lives. Drawing on models of market dynamics, we suggest how enslaved market participants enjoyed important adaptive advantages over non-participants.  We examine the abundance of locally manufactured ceramics, Chinese and European ceramics and other imported goods to measure change in market participation and uptake of costly consumer goods in each region.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We describe preliminary results from STP surveys of the slave-village sites associated with two sugar plantations on the island of Nevis, in the eastern Caribbean. On both plantations we identified two villages, one dating to the 18th century and a successor settlement from the early-19th century. STP methods reveal for the first time the internal structure of these sites and allow us to date the occupations with accuracy. The results point to synchronous and similar settlement shifts on both plantations, linked to changes in sugar production strategies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2008, an international team of archaeologists from National Museums Liverpool, The University of Southampton, and The Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery, based at Monticello in the United States, undertook an 18-month project to do just that: to provide scholars with access to archaeological and documentary data from five slave villages from three estates on the islands of Nevis and St. Kitts.  Funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee and The National Endowment for the Humanities, The St. Kitts-Nevis Digital Archaeology Initiative was founded to address fundamental questions about slavery while also making its discoveries—both the synthesis and the raw data—freely available to scholars and the public via the Internet. &amp;#x0D; This paper provides a brief overview of the Initiative, its outcomes, and preliminary results.  The project itself is very much in progress, with plans for additional collaborative fieldwork and research.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past four decades, archaeological research has played a significant role in our understanding of the strategies developed by slave societies in to maximize profits through the exploitation of human labor. Much of this research has focused on the Caribbean, which consumed hundreds of thousands of more enslaved bodies than the American colonies. Our goal today is to build on this research to advance our understanding of the historical trajectories of slave societies on Jamaica and Nevis during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Every year, on November 1st, "D. Hamilton Jackson Day," otherwise known as "Liberty Day," is celebrated in St. Croix.  Crucians are reminded then about Jackson's achievements in advancing civil liberties in the Islands, especially his contributions to freedom of the press, the first labor union, repeal of voting restrictions, right of public assembly, expansion of education, etc.  But much less is known about how he was treated by officers of the all-white U.S. Navy during the 14 years of Navy rule.  I researched the National Archives in Washington and found some interesting impressions of Jackson by Navy officers during U.S. military occupation.  Such impressions are important in assessing the barriers that confronted Jackson and others in their courageous efforts to advance the liberties of their fellow Virgin Islanders.1</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2007, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) created the Picturing America collection, a portfolio of art reproductions representing "[t]he nation's artistic heritage—our paintings, sculpture, architecture, fine crafts, and photography—offer[ing] unique insights into the character, ideals, and aspirations of our country."  Schools and libraries across the nation received the portfolio and complementary teaching resources, but K-12 teachers were slow to adopt the curriculum.  To encourage adoption, NEH-funded teacher professional development program.  As the result of a successful grant proposal, the Rivers Institute at Hanover College conducted a weeklong workshop to help fifty high school teachers integrate Picturing America images of landscapes into the core subjects of fine arts, American history and government, social studies, and English/language arts, employing images, primary, and secondary documents in their classrooms to see how artists have responded to changing American landscapes—physical, social, and political.  In keeping with the Rivers Institute mission "to promote an understanding of the natural and cultural history of river environments," and in conjunction with the bicentennial of the first steamboat to successfully navigate the Ohio &amp;amp; Mississippi rivers (1811), this workshop focused particularly on rivers, images of which comprise almost a quarter of the Picturing America collection.  This paper describes the workshop and suggest methods for small colleges to compete for grant funding and to develop similar teacher professional development programs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Despite the wealth of newly available digital materials, the scope of text-based investigations has mostly been limited to either synchronous or short-term historical analysis. In this paper, we report on the first stage of the project that focuses on tracking long-range historical change, specifically, on the history of ideas and concepts. The project's aim is to map out the history of representation of knowledge in Europe over last three centuries using as a proxy the history of changes in historical editions of Encyclopedia Britannica. We describe a series of corpus-analytical tasks necessary for building the analytical and comparative tools for historical analysis using scanned noisy text. In this first stage of the project, we focus specifically on the tools for tracking and visualizing the relative importance of people, interconnections between them, and the rise and fall of their reputations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Donne's Paul's Cross sermon for Gunpowder Day 1622 is best understood as a collaborative and interactive performance, not a monologue but a conversation, in which the congregation gathered for the sermon took an active and vocal role. The text of Donne's sermon represents only one side of this conversation. Given this, we face the challenge of recovering the congregation's side of this conversation. Sometimes, however, response is already scripted, as in in its participation in the Lord's Prayer at the beginning of the sermon. Other times it can be inferred from the way the preacher structures his presentation, inviting certain kinds of response. Various kinds of possible congregational responses can be modeled and demonstrated using our virtual model of the physical and acoustic environment for this sermon, as illustrated by five audio clips combining Ben Crystal's realization of Donne's Gunpowder Day sermon for November 5th, 1622 with hypothetical congregational responses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In understanding the shift from acceptance to rejection of slavery and slave-trading among American Quakers in the period from 1755-75, a key factor is the influence of the London Quaker hierarchy. The relationship between London Yearly Meeting and the colonial meetings closely resembled that between the central British government and its colonial periphery. Until the 1750s, London Friends signalled strongly that maintaining unity was of primary importance, largely silencing prophetic anti-slavery voices. In 1758, however, London Yearly Meeting issued a strong condemnation of slave-trading, and this directive was a substantial factor in American meetings taking the same stance over the following few years.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thomas Robinson (1731-1817), a life-long Quaker, spent six years in his early 20s engaged in trade with England and the West Indies, and sent at least five slaving voyages to the African coast. He stopped suddenly in 1760, and within a few years became an ardent abolitionist. Although family papers document his activities, he never explained how or why he changed his mind about slavery. This paper explores the various factors at work in Robinson's decision, including the disruptions in shipping occasioned by the Seven Years' War and the changing Quaker ethos that led to meeting disciplinary action against another Newport Quaker slave-trader.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>•In stark comparison to Thessaly and the Argolid, the study of Middle Helladic ceramics in central Greece has had to face a number of significant obstacles. One of these has been a lack of preserved stratigraphy from which to develop a stratified ceramic typology. Where stratigraphy has been recorded, as at Eutresis, the issue has been one of continuity in occupation. While the recent publication of the material from Orchomenos IV by K. Sarri has greatly contributed to an understanding of the development of Middle Helladic pottery, these problems continue to persist. This particularly affects the understanding of the so called ‘Grey Minyan' material (herein referred to as ‘Fine Grey Burnished') which seems to have been produced at one or more production centres in central Greece. The recent excavations at Mitrou have revealed in two deep trenches, located in different areas of the site, impressive sequences of MH deposits that are well stratified, related to architecture and span the whole of the Middle Helladic period. This enables the development of a stratified ceramic typology for central Greece which spans the whole of the period for the first time. This paper aims to present characteristics of the Fine Grey Burnished typology from all 7 Mitrou phases ranging from the end of Early Helladic III to the end of the Middle Helladic.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our knowledge of the LH IIIC pottery in east Central Greece is defined by discoveries at three major sites: Lefkandi, Kynos and Kalapodi. When starting the excavations at Mitrou, supported by promising results of the CHELP surface survey, it was hoped that Mitrou would join the ‘big three'.  It undoubtedly did, but not in an obvious way. At a site like Mitrou, it was reasonable to expect to find a LH IIIC Middle phase with elaborate, pictorial pottery and a rich repertoire of shapes, decent evidence for LH IIIC Late and, in fortunate circumstances, the transition to the EIA with the so-far elusive Submycenaean phase. After 5 years of excavation we are forced to verify these expectations. The LH IIIC Middle is difficult to define and there is nothing even remotely reminiscent of pictorial pottery.  Surprisingly, the LH IIIC Late period is the most exciting one with an unusual array of finds. Submycenaean, apart from one or two graves with a few vessels, is not detectable. In this paper, I will briefly describe the local pottery sequence and highlight some of the major discoveries. I will also try to address the relation of Mitrou pottery to the material from Kalapodi and Kynos. At the end of the paper, an interpretation of pottery record for the LH IIIC period will be offered.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During five years of excavation (2004-2008), the Mitrou Archaeological Project (MAP) has produced an unexpectedly large amount of Protogeometric pottery. The assemblages date to all three phases of the period and, most importantly, they come from both settlement and funerary contexts. The pottery stands in the Central Greek tradition (or what has become to be known as ‘Euboean koine') and, in this respect, will add little to our knowledge in terms of morphology and decoration. However, focusing on a deposit from an apsidal Building A, I will discuss two issues that seem to be new in the field. In a traditional way, the deposit should be characterized as a mixed assemblage of Middle and Late Protogeometric pottery. In spite of this ‘mixture', I will argue for the deposit being chronologically homogeneous and claim, with some external supporting evidence, that it represents a distinctive ceramic phase dated to the early stage of Late Protogeometric period. In the second part of my talk I will focus on technological aspect of Protogeometric fine wares, namely the building techniques. I will argue that not all the fine pottery was thrown but in fact wheel-coiled or wheel fashioned. The potential of these findings for the interpretation of potters' identity and the development of ceramic traditions will be discussed shortly.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2007, the remains of a small boat were discovered lying on a dirt road within the settlement of Mitrou, a site on the North Euboean Gulf in East Lokris. The wood was not preserved, but its disintegration had left a black stain in the shape of the boat's bottom. About half of this boat stain was excavated over a length of approximately 3 m and a maximum width of 1 m. The total hull length is estimated to have been 5.5–6.0 m. It was a slender craft, lanceolate in shape, curving gently in cross-section and profile, and tapering toward a blunt extremity. &amp;#x0D; The boat is dated to the Middle Helladic II Early pottery phase and must have been built ca. 1900 B.C. Its modest size suggests that it was a small transport vessel or fishing boat. This is only the fourth small boat discovered at a prehistoric site in Greece and the first Bronze Age vessel with substantial evidence for the hull shape. Thus, it is highly significant for our understanding of Aegean boatbuilding.&amp;#x0D; With its extremely thin hull and gentle curves, the Mitrou boat closely resembles expanded logboats of ancient and medieval date excavated in northern Europe. It is argued in this paper that the expanded logboat formed the basis of Aegean boatbuilding, and it determined the basic characteristics of Bronze Age and later plank-built ships in this region.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper illustrates the results of the study of Late Helladic (LH) IIIB ceramics from Mitrou, East Lokris, with particular reference to three significant deposits from the northeast excavation sector, one dating to LH IIIB1, the other two to LH IIIB2 Late.  &amp;#x0D; The evidence is presented in three main sections: a stratigraphic and contextual overview of the deposits; a description of the most important chronological and typological features of the pottery; and a discussion of the possible significance of the materials in the wider perspective of Mycenaean ceramic developments in central Greece.&amp;#x0D; Two interesting elements emerge from the examination of the LH IIIB2 Late assemblages. First, they include some features that are uncommon in non-Palatial sites, among which the comparatively high frequency of Rosette deep bowls is particularly striking. Second, LH IIIB2 deposits from Mitrou appear to be contemporary with the final catastrophes that affected the palaces of Mycenae, Tiryns, Midea, and Thebes, later than the destructions of Gla and Orchomenos, and slightly earlier than that of Dimini. The combination of these factors raises intriguing questions concerning the political geography of East Lokris in the final decades of the 13th century B.C.: were Mitrou and the surrounding region under the control of any Mycenaean Palace during this period? If this was the case, which of the powerful centres situated in the vicinity may be considered the best candidate?    &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Evidence suggests that purple dye was produced on the islet of Mitrou, a Bronze Age and Early Iron Age site in East-Lokris. The goal of this study is to determine the chronological and spatial patterning of crushed Murex shells in order to better understand the emergence of dye manufacture. The research hypothesis is that Murex dye production was related to the rise of a visible political elite at Mitrou beginning in the Late Helladic I phase, and that the scale of production was large enough to have exceeded the needs of the household, thus providing a cash crop for this elite to obtain goods such as copper and tin from elsewhere. Multi-layered statistical analyses were employed to test this two-pronged hypothesis. The first hypothesis that Murex dye production was related to the rise of the elite at Mitrou was confirmed by a series of chi-squared analyses. Based on site-wide estimates of the original Murex population, the second hypothesis that dye production exceeded domestic scale cannot be rejected, especially if dye was used to color thread rather than large pieces of fabric as is often assumed.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our 2004-2008 excavation and surface survey produced an unusually rich Prepalatial data set including settlement and mortuary remains. Preliminary studies indicate that a ruling elite manifested itself from LH I onwards through the creation of a landscape of power. In the settlement two elite complexes were constructed and long paved orthogonal roads were laid out, arguably intended to monumentalize performances of some sort.&amp;#x0D; The manipulation of the mortuary realm played a major role in the visualization of elite power. In LH I, two elite tombs were created in prominent locations and linked to a major road, ostensibly to enhance the performance value of elite mortuary rituals. One of these was Built Chamber Tomb 73, uniquely set inside elite complex D. At the same time, the long-standing practice of burying the dead among settlement buildings was abandoned, and possibly a permanent cemetery established to enhance a sense of community and create a larger mortuary landscape as backdrop for the elite tombs. After the LH IIIA:2 Early destruction of Building D, elite burials ceased in tomb 73, but evidence from the road and dromos points to public rituals continuing into the LH IIIC phase, reflecting a persisting link with the Prepalatial elite.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The study of urban sites is usually based on the analysis of architectural or cultural phases. The sediments of the excavated deposits inside or outside houses are rarely studied. The prehistoric site of Mitrou has a ca. 5-m deep archaeological sequence ranging from the Early Bronze Age through the Early Iron Age (ca. 2400-900 BCE). This provides a unique opportunity to study changes in the construction and maintenance of earthen floors and surfaces over a long time and relate them to cultural developments. The preliminary micromorphological study of more than 240 thin sections shows that the surfaces from the Early to Late Bronze I phases Mitrou has all the characteristics of a tell site with multiple replasterings of surfaces and a broad palette of material and techniques used. There is no clear association of a building phase to a floor level but rather to thick sequences of floor build-up. This practice ends sometime in the LH I phase, and from then on, floors are not frequently repaired and their construction technique is more standardized. The observed change can be broadly related to the rise of a local ruling elite at Mitrou. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Moreover, the contrasting maintenance techniques are pertinent to the discussions on the difference between tells and 'flat' settlements. Until the end of the Middle Helladic period, Mitrou has all the characteristics of a tell site whereas after that it resembles a 'flat' settlement. In Mitrou it appears that this change is related to a different perception of construction and maintenance of floors that in turn should be traced to the pattern of reconstruction of whole houses. As part of the material culture of a society these changes have a social significance that may reflect differences in household processes and space use.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Among the endeavors whereby the first Saxon emperor, Otto I, emulated Charlemagne were his campaigns into the pagan territories along the eastern frontier of the German kingdom.  Here, Otto sought to convert Slavs and Hungarians to Roman Christianity and thus to subjugate them.  Charlemagne had proceeded in a similar fashion against the very Saxons whose descendant Otto was.  One weapon within Otto's missionary arsenal was the eastern archbishopric of Magdeburg.  Here, the fabric of the cathedral incorporated spolia Otto acquired in Ravenna in emulation of Charlemagne's spoliation of ancient Italian sites on behalf of his palatine complex at Aachen.  Among Otto's Ravennate loot were several porphyry columns now in the choir at Magdeburg.  One such column, however, was culled from the larger group and presented to the community of canonesses resident in Essen, where it stands in the apse of the former convent church, testament, like several Egyptian rock crystal vessels in the treasury, of Otto's intentions for the convent--from 971/973, Essen was ruled by a succession of Ottonian princess-abbesses and served as a prominent locus of Ottonian authority.  In this paper, the example of Essen serves as a platform from which to explore Otto's exploitation of porphyry and rock crystal to construct, visibly and tangibly, such loci.  In bestowing these gifts on Essen, furthermore, Otto was relying on a Carolingian strategy rooted within traditions of Greco-Roman kingship display.  The selective placement of spoliated porphyry slabs around Charlemagne's throne in the Palatine Chapel at Aachen and the presentation by Charles the Bald of the so-called Cup of Solomon, with its rock crystal portrait of a Persian king, to the monastery of St.-Denis represent two Carolingian instances of the calculated exploitation of these materials, a strategy adopted by Otto I to establish, enhance, and propagate Ottonian imperial authority.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the course of several years spent studying the valuable gifts presented by the Ottonian rulers to the monasteries and convents they favored, it has become increasingly clear to me that the lines of inquiry I have followed have produced a rather one-sided understanding of these donations.  I have demonstrated that the intent of the royal donors in presenting many of these gifts was to mark the recipient house as a locus of Ottonian imperial authority, and that the beneficiaries' responses indicate a consonant understanding of the gift.  For example, the early art patronage of Abbess Mathilde of Essen, including the first of her two processional crosses as well as the so-called Golden Virgin, is clearly in keeping with the message intended by Otto I when he presented a porphyry column--unequivocal symbol of imperial status--to Essen just a few years before.  The fact that the small diadem with which, it is believed, the child Otto III was crowned was subsequently presented to Essen, where it rested on the head of the Golden Virgin on particularly important feast-days, visually reiterated the relationship between Mathilde's convent and the Ottonian dynasty in a strikingly vivid fashion.  But how were these visual symbols received and interpreted by their broader audience, the secular community of Essen whose spiritual life was the responsibility of the convent?  This paper is a prolegomenon on the topic, establishing basic facts:  who saw the imperial gifts, where, and on what occasions; who enabled access to them; and what display rituals and texts were employed.  The survival of an ordinale from medieval  Essen, rich in details concerning the quotidian spiritual activities of the convent and its neighbors, offers solid ground from which to proceed.  I conclude by offering some suggestions concerning the signification that accrued to the imperial gifts, through display and ritual, in the eyes and minds of the mundane audience.    &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digital modeling projects are not exercises in time travel but opportunities to bring together diverse forms of historical documentation and to experience -- and thus to be able to assess -- the appropriateness of our conceptual models. Digital modeling projects also need to be grounded in specific data, in this case  provided by careful measurement of the cathedral by Christopher Wren and of the cathedral's foundations by John Schofield and of the Cross's foundations by F C Penrose.&amp;#x0D; Our model of St Paul's and Paul's Churchyard enables us to explore the experience of John Donne's sermon for Gunpowder Day 1622, a sermon that was intended for delivery at Paul's Cross on the first Tuesday in November of 1622 but "because of the weather" was actually delivered inside the cathedral.&amp;#x0D; This has enabled us to explore several issues relevant to the experience of the Paul's Cross sermon. Here, I address two of these, audibility of the sermon given possible variations in crowd sizes and the location of the auditor, and questions of preaching as an address by a speaker to a generally passive audience or as a collaborative and interactive performance, in effect, a conversation for which the surviving text of these sermons represented only one side of the conversation.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Giacomo Costantino Beltrami was an Italian explorer who visited the Northwest Territories (current day Minnesota) in 1823, and subsequently became dually obsessed with Native American culture and mapping the source of the Mississippi River. Legendary tales indicate Beltrami's main protection was a red silk umbrella, which distinguished him as an outsider to Dakota and Ojibwe people. Although Beltrami lost his rights to the Euro-American "discovery" of the sources of the Mississippi River to Schoolcraft in 1832, his legacy as a collector and documenter of Native American culture far outlasts that honor.&amp;#x0D; The red umbrella still exists as part of the Beltrami Collections in Italy, along with 97 Native American objects collected during the 1823 trip. Beltrami practiced more direct ethnology than was common at the time. His travelogue, though flawed, describes Ojibwe and Dakota people, their daily activities, discusses their appearance, material culture, and perhaps most importantly, their names. Particularly, Beltrami documents Indigenous women in a manner not seen with other early explorers or anthropologists.&amp;#x0D; This paper will detail selected objects in the collection, their connections to Beltrami's narrative, their provenience, and how ideas about gender, cultural exchanges, and tribal designation has been expanded through comparative research and consultations with Dakota and Ojibwe cultural specialists.&amp;#x0D; This project and research at museums in Italy is funded in part by a 2011 National Endowment for the Humanities Research Fellowship award.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Learning using labels provided by multiple annotators has attracted a lot of&amp;#x0D; interest in the machine learning community. With the advent of crowdsourcing&amp;#x0D; cheap, noisy labels are easy to obtain. This has&amp;#x0D; raised the question of how to assess&amp;#x0D; annotator quality. Prior work uses  %expectation maximization, gaussian mixture models and &amp;#x0D; bayesian inference to estimate consensus labels and obtain annotator scores based on expertise; the key assumptions are that the ground truth is known and categories of labels are predefined. In applications where it is possible to have \emph{multiple} ground truths, &amp;#x0D; assessing annotator quality is challenging since the ranking of annotators' is dependent on the choice of ground-truth. This paper describes a case-study in the context of annotating historic newspaper articles from the New York&amp;#x0D; Public Library. The goal is to assign fine-grained categorization of articles labeled ``editorial" by the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. The task is subjective since pre-defined categories are not available. To define the ground truth we use a Community Structure Detection (CSD) algorithm in a similarity graph formed between articles. The labels from the CSD algorithm provides the target function to be learned. Annotators labels are then viewed as \emph{related} tasks that help learn this target function. The technique helps to provide insights into how to rank annotator performance using well known information retrieval metrics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This talk was about the acquisition of ergative morphemes (set A in the Mayan literature) in Chuj Maya. These morphemes occur depending on the first initial of the transitive verb: consonant initial or vowel initial. Our main finding shows that Chuj-speaking children show an early knowledge of ergative morphemes. The morphological realization of these morphemes is conditioned by phonological reasons. That is, Chuj-speaking children acquire ergative morphemes first with vowel-initial verbs and later morphemes with consonant-initial verbs. This is shown in (1).&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; (1)a.tzala'.Vowel-initial transitive verb&amp;#x0D; = tz-ø-ø-al-a'&amp;#x0D; INC-ABS3-ERG2-say-TV&amp;#x0D; ‘You say it.'&amp;#x0D; b.tutu'.Consonant-initial transitive verb&amp;#x0D; = tz-ø-in-kuch-u'&amp;#x0D; INC-ABS3-ERG1-carry-TV&amp;#x0D;  ‘I will carry it.'Mal (1;8,0)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay asks how the sound and symbolism of Edith Piaf resonates across time and space in French and U.S. cultural memory, and how interrogating the 'power of Piaf' in spaces as far apart as Mathieu Kassovitz' LA HAINE and early programs of the French Broadcasting System in North America can help us capture key elements of the transatlantic aural and cultural ties binding France and the U.S. culture in the history of transatlantic communications. I explore why and how the sound of Piaf became a crucial cultural resource for Radiodiffusion Française (RDF) the French national broadcasting system, which began producing programs for the international/U.S. market after World War II. It follows Edith Piaf's career as a metonym of modern French cultural stardom with global circulatory powers, and the ways that state-sponsored French broadcasting took up the power of Piaf.

		<Abstract>In Lachixío, Oaxaca, a code-shifting socialization style is taking hold that was first advocated by state-sponsored teachers and had been resisted through the political organization of generations of Zapotec parents protecting Zapotec as a home language while Spanish became institutionally pervasive in this rural community. This talk uses transcribed videotaped data to examine topics at issue in a conversational conflict revealing the tense social relations entailed by rapid social change. In a Zapotec dialogue, an elder woman noticed a young Zapotec teacher-assistant addressing his daughter in Spanish. She posed a question explicitly topicalizing whether his daughter understands Zapotec, and implicitly, critically topicalizing the emerging code-shifting socialization style. Ironic statements introduce two topics: one coded in the proposition and another that lurks in the inferential pragmatics. The man only orients to and ratifies the explicit topic.  Only after his "missing" the inference over several turns does the woman make the topic explicit, and then shifts to a less controversial topic. Topical irony as indirect critique is a discursive device that allows for ideological contestation without profoundly damaging ongoing social relations. This appeals to the polite social context where the man is a visitor in the woman's household. The new socialization style of addressing children exclusively in Spanish represents a contemporary transformation of the political-economy and the ongoing integration of the autonomous indigenous region into the Mexican nation state.  Topicalizing the new socialization style through "topic irony" reveals a subtle interactional mechanism involved in the contestation of these social changes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>New England Native peoples have survived for well over four hundred years, and so have documents relating to their history and culture.  Official reports from authorities in London, correspondence and financial accounts from colonial and state governments throughout the region, and petitions, memorials, and letters from Indians themselves are only part of a 400-year-old documentary record that still exists in various repositories around the world.  Yet, much of that record has remained unpublished and, for various reasons, difficult to access.  A New England Native elder once lamented that researching her tribal history was as difficult as holding on to the wind.  But in the past few years, technology and innovation has offered a solution.&amp;#x0D; This panel of editors and Native professionals explores two electronic scholarly editing projects at Yale University that make primary source materials on New England Indians freely available to scholars, educators, and tribal members: the Works of Jonathan Edwards and the Yale Indian Papers Project.  Presenters Minkema and Neele will examine digitized sources relating to Jonathan Edwards' 18th century mission to the Stockbridge Indian community.  Presenter Glaza will demonstrate the research features of the Yale Indian Papers Project's web application.  Presenter Grant-Costa will show how access to Indian documents has begun to change the parameters with which historians are able to conceptualize Native New England history. Presenter Davison will explain how documents have reshaped her tribe's understanding of its own history, while Presenter Flowers will discuss how some documents played a crucial role in her tribe's federal recognition efforts.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Access and Collaboration: The Challenges of Editing Native American Documents."&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; New England Native peoples have survived for well over four hundred years, and so have documents relating to their history and culture. Much of that record has remained unpublished and difficult to access. The Yale Indian Papers Project, together with its partners, have developed the virtual archive that is the New England Indian Papers Series Database, a robust database and web interface that allows researchers greater access to these materials through facsimile images and two levels of transcription combined with scholarly commentary. Despite an overwhelmingly positive response from both the native and non-native research community, a project of this nature is not without its challenges, including logistical and technical issues, conservation and preservations concerns, and forging and maintaining relationships with Tribes and contributing institutions. The very process of editing Native American primary source materials, in itself, can present a number of dilemmas, such as giving voice to a Native frame of reference, understanding Native sensibilities towards particular documentary items, and incorporating Native ideas of history into textual annotations. These challenges, among others, are explored in this presentation by Paul Grant-Costa and Tobias Glaza.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Josephine Lee (Professor of English and Asian American Studies, UM) and Sarah Bellamy (Artistic Director, Penumbra Theatre) will talk about the intersecting histories and contemporary dynamics of black and Asian representation in American theater.  Lee will share some of her current research on how different theatrical forms such as minstrelsy, vaudeville, and musical theater juxtaposed blackface representation and stage orientalism in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Bellamy will comment on how this history has affect theater practice today, and what kinds of change and collaboration we might imagine for the future. This will be a fascinating conversation about how American theater defines or moves across racial lines, understanding the persistence of racial stereotypes, and building coalitions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Soon after Ernest Hemingway won the Nobel Prize, his works returned to the Soviet literary market. However, cultural relations between the United States and the USSR were disrupted when Boris Pasternak was selected for the prize in 1958. This article examines Hemingway's reaction to Pasternak's refusal of the prize, as well as his understanding of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli's role in the publication of Doctor Zhivago abroad. In so doing, the precarious position of the author will be highlighted in order to demonstrate that while Hemingway became an iconic figure in the USSR, Pasternak was simultaneously denied similar accolades for his cultural production.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ernest Hemingway's inclusion among the heroes of the Soviet Union is meaningful beyond the author's own world-wide fame. Symbolically, it was the moment when the most-American of authors gained a Soviet biography; when Hemingway was fully and completely co-opted into the Soviet literary space. Understanding that Hemingway would not achieve political consciousness in the Socialist Realist sense, Gribanov positioned his subject as an independent writer and journalist dedicated to telling the truth, often to the detriment of his personal and professional relationships. This interpretation was original given preceding Soviet interpretation of the American author and his works. It was also somewhat risky within the context of the trial of the writers Andrei Siniavskii and Yulii Daniel. In this paper, I will argue that with such an approach, Gribanov positioned the author as an independent truth-teller, in the face of political ideologies and repressive governments, appealing to avid readers of Hemingway as well as to a Soviet readership taught to read between the lines.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 1936 and 1939 Ernest Hemingway began to display a political commitment that made him attractive to left-leaning American critics and to Soviet cultural merchants. His former contempt for any ideology and a willingness to expose the sham made his public image even more salient once he became an outspoken antifascist. Hemingway's departure for Spain as a news correspondent to cover the Spanish Civil War was praised in the Soviet Union, where there was some anticipation that the author would move beyond the pessimism, skepticism and individualism that had been noted in his early literary works. "The Chauffeurs of Madrid" appeared in the journal Abroad (Za rubezhom) on 25 June 1937. The novel To Have and Have Not was published in October 1937 and a Russian translation soon followed in International Literature (Internatsional'naia literatura) with a tentatively positive response from Soviet critics. A portion of his film script, The Spanish Earth, was published in the newspaper Izvestiia on 29 December 1937. The entire film script was published in International Literature in 1938.  Yet, it was Hemingway's play, The Fifth Column that was met with unanimous enthusiasm. It was translated into Russian and published in the first number of International Literature for 1939.  This paper will examine in some detail Hemingway's emerging social consciousness and the positive response of his Soviet critics that validated their earlier efforts to co-opt the American author for the Soviet experiment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mass digitization has allowed greater access to archival materials than ever before. While access has certainly improved, processing and analyzing the rich information contained in these drawings remains challenging. In the age of ‘big data,' having access to information is no longer enough; we need tools to sift through massive amounts of raw information to identify meaning and pattern (Manovich, 2012). Frustrated by the lack of tools to analyze archival ?oor plans, the authors considered the following question: How can we automate the collection of ?oor plan information and explore patterns and relationships between plans, architects/designers, and time periods? In this paper we explore the challenges of analyzing archival ?oor plans and provide an overview of the Building Database &amp;amp; Analytics System (BuDAS), which we developed to address these problems.

		<Abstract>The success of plan recognition is determined by two main factors: 1). quality of the plan image, and 2). interpretation of the plan information. Plan image quality includes factors such as clarity, contrast, and digital noise. A high-quality plan image has high contrast, minimal noise, and clear lines and text. Plan interpretation is essentially how well the system is able to process and make sense of the layers of plan information. A basic floor plan that includes walls, windows, doors, and room labels is easier for the system to interpret than a plan with additional layers of information, such as furniture, dimension stringers, material symbols, grids, landscaping, and ceilings or rooflines. These additional layers of information can result in the plan detection misidentifying other lines as walls, for example. By testing each of these variables, we are able to determine how to improve plan for users. This poster will explore the results of these tests and suggest areas for improvement.

		<Abstract>Close reading and distant reading are widely used in digital humanities and can benefit from information visualizations. Digital humanities scholars have curated numerous TEI-encoded textual collections which provide the data necessary for blending both close and distant reading – however we do not have tools to support general users in conducting these blended analyses. In this paper we focus on one such collection: Women Writers Online (WWO). We contribute the design and implementation of a multiple coordinated view network visualization to facilitate close and distant reading in WWO and a transparent view into our iterative design process to help guide future designers and humanists in applying our approach to other textual collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Motherhood is a pervasive theme in Elizabeth Catlett's sculptural and printmaking practice. In her 1940 MFA thesis she wrote that the mother-child motif was "one in which blackness and femaleness intersect." In the late 1960s, after race riots engulfed major US cities and the release of the Moynihan Report damning the state of the Negro family, Catlett's prints started to explore the trauma of Black motherhood and the impossibility of biological reproduction in such times of crisis. This paper analyzes a selection of Catlett's prints from 1969-1980 and argues that Catlett deploys repetition and seriality as artistic strategies to counter the negative mainstream discourses concerning Black women. While Catlett's early career has received scholarly attention, her late-career printmaking practice (post-1970) remains heretofore understudied as such this paper addresses this lacuna while also offering new insights into contemporary African American printmaking practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Lockers were central to the quotidian functioning of al-Azhar as a center of Islamic teaching and learning. Students and scholars used lockers to store quires, codices, writing materials and instruments, vessels, kettles, utensils, bread, bedding, clothing, headgear, and valuables. Over time, lockers took the form of capital, which, if inherited or purchased, could be parlayed into financial gain, and, occasionally, into locker empires (shares in multiple lockers). Ottoman sijill records from 1530 to 1650 show that usufruct rights to lockers passed through family networks and circulated beyond those directly associated with al-Azhar. When Shaykh Ahmad al-Ghunaymi al-Ansari died in 1634-5, the renowned Arabic grammarian and scholar of dialectical theology (kalam) had built a locker empire at al-Azhar; at the age of 80, he held usufruct rights to eight lockers in the Fuwwat fraternity. This paper studies the social lives of Ahmad's lockers following his death, the reallocation of three lockers to students and scholars of al-Azhar, and the inheritance and sale of five lockers by his son Kamal al-Din and widow Kulthum. This paper builds on the insights of Arjun Appadurai, Celia Lury, and Igor Kopytoff, who demonstrate that a biographical approach to material objects, for example, the study of ‘paths' and ‘life histories' of objects, can illuminate their human and social context. This approach, when applied to al-Azhar's lockers, can offer insight into the everyday lives of Muslim educational institutions, and the values of the men and women connected to them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How metadata is involved in the data-driven scientific practice is an important means to evaluate its values, the goal underlying the concept of metadata capital. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose a research project aiming to examine how metadata activities are embedded in research and data activities, as represented in research and data lifecycle models. As a first step of this project, we identify research and data lifecycle models and that best fit the scope of this project and offer some higher-level mapping among research activities, data processes, and metadata activities. This work offers a solid framework for the next step of this project to better understand the real-world values of metadata works and outputs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines medieval discussions of iconography, what an image represents. It concentrates on what Dale Kinney has called narrative etiologies, that is cases where medieval viewers, provoked by an image they did not understand, invent a story that explains it. My examples include the contested reception of ruler portraits, inquiries into images in churches, and narrative elaborations on hagiographical images. These cases demonstrate that medieval viewers were quite happy to accept Pope Gregory the Great's invitation to read images as the literate read texts. For the art historian, they offer gratifying proof that images may provoke verbal narratives instead of merely depending on them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digital data play increasingly prominent roles in archaeological research. However, data tend to be considered "raw materials" that fuel scholarship and not as intellectual contributions in their own right. Most attention on "research data management" focuses on "management" where data are considered mainly through the lens of Taylorism (bureaucratic compliance, standards, incentives, and metrics). Research data management largely aims for "Big Data" research opportunities achieved through centralization, economies of scale, and the efficient production of measurable research outcomes. To provoke debate, this paper suggests an alternative model of "Slow Data" that emphasizes thoughtful consideration of data throughout the research process. Our experience with Open Context shows that to be usable by a wider community, data require substantive intellectual investment in modeling and validation. Ideally, researchers should plan for reuse outcomes well before they start data collection. Thus, the intellectual investment underlying data curation must become more integral to the whole practice of archaeology. Rather than simply rewarding high throughput and impact for easily-measured research outputs (papers or even archived datasets), greater recognition for the research process will promote better contextualization of data, leading to meaningful research outcomes from data integration, greater reproducibility, and better ethical practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The scholarly community is giving data increasing attention in recent years, and solutions for data management are emerging. However, seeing data management primarily as a matter of compliance means that we face continued data loss, as many datasets enter repositories without adequate description to enable their reuse. Furthermore, because many researchers have little experience reuse of public data, they lack understanding and incentives to consider changes in their own research practices to facilitate future reuse. Improving data reuse raises the issue of data standards. While many researchers employ standards for simplifying comparisons across datasets, they are constrained by the fact that standards reflect research goals and agendas that are not necessarily universally shared. This paper discusses Linked Open Data (LOD) as an approach to improving data description, intelligibility, and discoverability to facilitate reuse. I present examples of how annotating zooarchaeology datasets with LOD can facilitate data integration without forcing standardization. I conclude by recognizing that data sharing is not without its challenges. However, the research community's careful attention and recognition of datasets as valuable scholarly outputs will go a long way to ensuring that the products of our work are much more widely useful.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The publication of detailed excavation and survey results is a fundamental need for archaeology. However, our discipline has long recognized the uphill battle in motivating and financing completion of such works. Changes in the economics of publishing, as well as the rapid proliferation of digital documentation, create new challenges for publishing primary field research in archaeology. Currently, the majority of the evidence (now digital) collected in field research is left behind in the publication process. Rather than consider digital data as a residue of our work that, if lucky, may end up in a repository, we should explore new publication models that richly integrate digital data with narrative syntheses. This paper highlights how this can be cost-effective, improve the reproducibility of archaeological interpretation, reach broader audiences, and have wider impacts. To accomplish these goals, we discuss key aspects of information architecture and the challenge of developing publication workflows that support both narrative and data editorial processes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Making Archaeology FAIR was a forum co-organized by Sarah Kansa (Open Context) and Julian Richards (Archaeology Data Service), with eight panelists including SLO-data team members Anne Austin and Eric Kansa.   Abstract: Most archaeologists today use computers and other digital technology to document their work. Many develop data management plans, as required by many funders of archaeology in recent years. Still, most archaeologists lack a clear understanding of both how to make their data widely accessible and intelligible for reuse, and why they would want to do so. This forum discusses the FAIR Data Principles, developed to guide data creators and publishers in making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Each forum discussant will select one FAIR principle to discuss in the context of archaeology. How well does archaeology currently address each of these challenges? Since archaeology can be a destructive practice, how much effort should we put into ensuring that our data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable? What can we do to ensure that these goals are prioritized at a project's inception, rather than as an afterthought? How do we ensure that archaeologists collecting data also share algorithms, tools, and workflows that led to that data? Are there additional principles that define "good" data dissemination in archaeology? Forum attendees can prepare for the discussion by reading "The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship": http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeology is a data-rich discipline, and the management and preservation of digital data are integral to all aspects of ethically responsible professional practice. Public and private granting bodies recognize the importance of data, and often formalize this recognition by requiring grant seekers to provide "data management plans." However, many archaeologists lack familiarity with good research data management practices and how these articulate with other aspects of research. This paper is informed by the ongoing, NEH-funded Secret Life of Data (SLO-Data, https://alexandriaarchive.org/secret-life-of-data/) study which uses evidence from observations of ongoing excavations as well as interviews with reusers to improve archaeological data workflows and guide researchers in how to create meaningful data management plans. The discussion will consider each step of the research life-cycle from planning, data modeling, fieldwork, laboratory, and collections studies, to collaboration within teams and, finally, dissemination, preservation, and reuse. We will highlight the intellectual commitment needed to contextualize data, including the need to link and relate project data with the data contributions curated by other experts. The paper will also highlight criteria that need to be considered in peer review so that grant review processes can better recognize and reward excellence. Finally, responsible research data management needs to be more integral to publishing and not just granting practices. Therefore, the paper will conclude with recommendations to help guide publishers, editors, and peer reviewers in evaluating the reproducibility of claims made with research data.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeologists share an ethical obligation to publish, archive, and share their field data and research results. One expectation of making archaeological data publicly available is its eventual reuse. Yet, research into archaeological data reuse demonstrates that building accessible data repositories does not necessarily result in substantial reuse of archaeological data (Huggett 2018). What limitations prevent archaeological data from reuse and how can these be addressed during and after archaeological fieldwork?  The Secret Life of Data (SLO-data) project follows the lifecycle of data from the field to the digital repository to better understand opportunities and challenges in data interpretation, publication, and reuse. We use a mixed-methods approach of interviews, field observations, and excavation data assessments to identify the challenges faced by four different archaeological sites around the world. Our subjects are international teams comprised of senior excavation staff, students, registrars, and specialists, all engaged with data creation, but sometimes asynchronously and with personnel changes from year to year. In this paper, we report common findings that impeded archaeological data reuse across these four projects based on interviews and observations conducted during the 2016-2018 field seasons. We then review how technical and organizational adjustments that resulted from these findings impacted data creation and management practices at each site. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings can be applied to  archaeological projects more broadly to better streamline data collection during fieldwork and in the lab for project sharing and eventual reuse.

		<Abstract>Publication needs to promote more responsible stewardship of the archaeological and historical record. In order to meet this goal, this talk will outline good practices in the use of digital publishing services that have the support of digital library and other preservation services required to curate scholarly content for the long term. This talk will highlight Open Context's collaborations with scholarly publishers, and recent progress in augmenting conventional publication workflows with more the editorially supported preparation, cleaning, documentation, curation, publication and repository archiving of large datasets, including 3D media. While advancing our ethical conduct, these examples will demonstrate how improved publication practices can help archaeologists address pressing public outreach, education, preservation, and research needs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Archaeological excavations are comprised of interdisciplinary teams that create, manage, and share data as they unearth and analyse material culture.These team-based settings are ripe for collective curation, particularly among the excavation teams responsible for unearthing the materials and the specialists responsible for analyzing them. Yet, findings from four excavation sites show specialist data tend to remain unlinked and decontextualized from excavation data. In this paper, we discuss these findings, the opportunities we identified for collective curation, and responses from the four excavation projects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines the historical significance of the rebuilding of Laupahoehoe School, a Hawai‘i public school on the eastern coastline of Hawai‘i Island. The original school, along with major roads and infrastructure, was destroyed when an enormous tidal wave hit the island in April 1946. The destruction of the school came at a time (just after World War II) when Hawai‘i's population was growing rapidly, and older buildings were stretched to capacity with wartime children. Alfred Preis, a Jewish refugee architect from Nazi-occupied Vienna was selected to develop the Laupahoehoe design. Until 1946, Pries's work in Hawai‘i had remained closely wedded to the Austrian modernist form languages he had learned while studying in Vienna; he hadn't quite absorbed the ways in which design in the tropics could, or should, be different from architecture in temperate Europe. At Laupahoehoe, however, the post-disaster situation – which included impassable roads and serious difficulties importing building materials – forced Preis to improvise and to develop his skills as a tropical, regionalist architect. Preis used locally sourced materials, such as lava rock and ohia trees – a highly significant plant in indigenous tradition – and developed a passive climate control system derived from local wind patterns. He married these materials and techniques to his own Viennese traditions about ornament, and functional and spatial planning, creating a singularly regionalist building. At Laupahoehoe School, Preis thus put forward a new vision of tropical architecture for the islands – one that made modernism Hawaiian.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rhetoricians of medicine have long been concerned over the effects of industry money on biomedical practices. Corporate-funded clinical trials, free lunches, free travel, and industry honoraria for scientists have been shown to adversely affect the integrity of biomedical research. Despite the broad recognition of these hazards, efforts to address them have largely been limited to disclosure requirements. Current standards require clinical researchers to report certain conflicts of interest alongside published scholarship. Unfortunately, a growing body of evidence indicates that disclosure statements have been shown to cause audiences to actually extend more trust to those holding conflicts of interest, as disclosure provides an opportunity to display both honesty and expertise. disclosure requirements embody some of the most concerning aspects of neoliberal oversight in that they focus attention on individual behavior rather than cultural conditions. Ultimately, a significant shift in our understanding of conflicts of interest is required, and this is where the insights of computational rhetorics can be beneficial. Accordingly, this paper presents findings derived from a computational analysis of 34 million biomedical research articles. Specifically, this paper explores the development a new integrated machine-learning, named-entity recognition toolkit designed to extracting financial relationships data from natural language and visualize those relationships using interactive network diagrams. The ultimate aim here is to allow rhetoricians of medicine and allied researchers to visualize the systemic aggregation of biomedical funding for any given health area of interest. This research has the potential to effectively support future rhetorics of medicine scholarship on medicine and industry funding.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper explores the development of deontological morality as a form of social intervention in late Ottoman society (1870s-1920). Undergoing socioeconomic and political upheavals in this period, the Ottoman public sphere was saturated with moral reform demands. This project focuses on a cohort of moralists, who took an entrepreneurial role in indigenizing a duty-centered civic morality, while criticizing state and society.  Having diverse ethno-confessional (Muslim, Christian, Jewish) and ideological origins, they played a significant role in articulating clashing politico-moral visions.  The language they constructed contributed significantly to the politicization of morality and moralization of citizenship in Ottoman and post-Ottoman societies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2019, the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus's founding in Weimar Germany is being celebrated around the world, but the school's origins in the work and writings of Walter Gropius's predecessor in Weimar, Henry van de Velde, are rarely mentioned. This talk explores the oeuvre of this influential Belgian artist, whose work as a painter, designer, architect, and theorist in Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands helped shape the origins of abstraction as an international language that originated in painting but encompassed all the visual media. This presentation consisted of a talk and a circulated text, which represented the first draft of my general introduction for Henry van de Velde: Selected Essays.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>En septiembre de 2017, Puerto Rico recibió el impacto de los Huracanes Irma y María, causando gran devastación en todo el Archipiélago. Las repercusiones de dicho evento atmosférico han hecho de la recuperación en las bibliotecas, archivos y museos una lenta y difícil. Además, ha requerido la revisión de las prácticas implementadas hasta la fecha para salvaguardar eficientemente los recursos de los cuales son responsables y asegurar su continuo acceso.   Tal es el caso de la Biblioteca de la Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Mayagüez, la cual carecía de un programa dedicado al cuidado de colecciones y manejo de desastres antes del acontecimiento. Aunque sufrieron el impacto de los huracanes, gracias a una respuesta rápida, lograron mitigar los daños con prontitud y asegurar fondos de emergencia para adiestrar personal y estabilizar las colecciones impactadas. Además, esta experiencia dio paso a reconocer un nuevo escenario post-Maria, y surge un proyecto novedoso en la institución con el fin de mejorar la capacidad de prevención, mitigación, preparación, respuesta y recuperación.  Con el fin de inspirar a otros colegas ante la continua amenaza por desastres naturales en nuestra región, en este cartel, se compartirán las estrategias implementadas para el establecimiento de un programa de preservación, con énfasis en: la formación de un equipo de trabajo con la colaboración y mentoría de expertos, la capacitación del personal, las actividades de monitoreo y control climático, el proceso de evaluación y realmacenamiento de recursos afectados y el desarrollo de un plan de emergencias para colecciones.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Frank Lloyd Wright remains one of America's best known and most prolific architects, credited with designing more than 1,000 structures. Such a sizable oeuvre holds hundreds of thousands of data points. Much of this data, however, remains untapped. Wright's floor plans, for example, are full of rich layers of information (e.g., tracking room names over time can indicate changing societal preferences/shifts). But to utilize the data in hundreds or thousands of these plans, requires either reproducing them in CAD or BIM or measuring and recording the information by hand. Both are time consuming and prone to error. In response, we developed a tool that allows users to analyze large corpora of architectural floor plan images. The Building Database &amp;amp; Analytics System (BuDAS) unites complementary manual data entry and image recognition to automate the process of floor plan detection and analysis. In this study, we explore Wright's changing conception of space through an analysis of his residential floor plans using BuDAS.   Space is a topic Wright discussed frequently throughout his career, including in his autobiography and principles of organic architecture, among other venues. But do Wright's pontifications on space stand in accordance with his built work? Using floor plan images of Wright's residences uploaded to BuDAS, we collected information on room relationships, doors/openings, room sizes, and room names/categories. After uploading plan images, BuDAS automatically detects and collects information related to room sizes, types, and relationships. This, along with contextual information entered manually (e.g., location, date of construction, cost, name of client), is stored in the database for analysis.  Using the data collected from Wright's residential floor plans, we explore interior and exterior space usage (minimum, average, and maximum square footage) and room relationships (connectivity, adjacency, and openness) over the course of his career.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper I trace the political careers of Dr. Elvira Rawson de Dellepiane and Isabel Gimenez Bustamante.  A pioneering feminist, Rawson nevertheless joined the zenophobic antileftist Liga Patriotica Argentina in 1919, whose male leaders opposed feminism. Gimenez Bustamante belonged to several Nationalist (the Argentine homegrown version of fascism) groups in the 1930s.  While both women moved from the extreme right to antifascism, their antifascism manifested discomfort with the notion of an egalitarian democracy that included laborers and descendants of immigrants.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Junta de la Victoria was an Argentine women's antifascist movement.  It engaged in three types of networks: (a) its transnational network with a kindred group in Uruguay, Accion Femenina por la Victoria; (b) an Argentine-wide network of chapters  headed by its national board in Buenos Aires; and (c) the network(s) of women who formed the activist core within each chapter. In this presentation I analyzed aspects of these networks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Not all singing happened in the choir or even the church in the Middle Ages. Processions outside the church, for instance, were conducted in song, from the psalms and litanies that filled the great distances to the antiphons and responsories that marked important cultic destinations. Chapter meetings, too, included the singing of multiple kinds of chant. This paper explores a little known practice in a forgotten musical setting: the singing of chant in and around the monastic refectory. If we are accustomed to thinking of the refectory as a place of silence, medieval customaries show that this was not the case. Through its rituals and layout, the refectory became a sacred space, linked in many ways to the choir and altar of the church. Indeed, the intoning of blessings and readings and sometimes even the singing of psalms, antiphons, or other chants before and after mealtime made the monks refectio not so much a break from the liturgy as a continuation of it, and a commentary upon it. Indeed, the use of music in the refectory reflected the liturgical season and the relative festivity of the liturgy in the church. This paper relies on customaries, ordinals, prayer books, and other historical sources to illuminate the performance of chant before, during, and after mealtime in the medieval monastery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From its early days as a Christian city, Paris—like many cities in France—was defined in relation to the life and death of its first evangelizer and bishop. The earliest passio of Saint Denis, from the late fifth or early sixth century, described the saint's arrival, evangelical activities, and martyrdom in the pagan stronghold. Abbot Hilduin's famous ninth-century passio further elaborated the city's sacred topography, from its center, where Saint Denis endured torments and imprisonment, to Montmartre, where the saint and his companions suffered martyrdom. But the saint's medieval cult centered on the abbey of Saint-Denis outside Paris, the burial place chosen (according to Hilduin) by the head-toting martyr himself. Indeed, the suburban abbey enjoyed unrivaled prosperity and fame as the shrine of the royal patron saint, the royal necropolis and depository, and the beneficiary of the famous Lendit and Saint Denis fairs. It also boasted independence from the bishop of Paris.  This paper explores the efforts of the Notre-Dame canons and Capetian kings to claim the cult of Saint Denis for the city, particularly after Paris became the uncontested capital of the French kingdom in the twelfth century. These efforts included the canons' centuries-long contest over the saint's cranium; their particular elaborations of his festal liturgies and institution of a new feast, the Susceptio reliquiarum; their frequent processions to the stational church of Saint-Denis-du-Pas; and their annual processions to Montmartre. The monarchy, while increasing its allegiance to the abbey of Saint-Denis, also augmented the saint's urban legacy by endowing churches associated with places in his vita et passio, calling for urban processions of his relics, and instituting his liturgical cult at the Sainte-Chapelle. This paper thus maps the sacred topography of medieval Paris as the city of Saint Denis.</Abstract>
