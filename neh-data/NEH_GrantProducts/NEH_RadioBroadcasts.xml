		<Abstract>Growing up is hard to do, and for young Arabs, it can be a nightmare. The region's bulging youth population is facing a bleak economic future. Plus, they live in a seething cauldron of tribal, national, religious, social, and political forces that simultaneously pull east and west. It was Paul Gauguin who asked, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? Those are some of the very questions young Arabs are asking themselves, and the answers have implications far beyond the region.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sitting in limbo is where many young Arabs find themselves today. Nearly a quarter of Arabs under 30 are jobless. Long gone are the days of a guaranteed government gig, and the private sector is far from filling the gap. Today, Arab youth are searching for work and waiting for weddings. Some just want to leave the region – and its long unemployment lines – altogether.  At best, unemployment and flagging Arab economies lead to a generation of bored and frustrated youth. At worst, economic conditions create a breeding ground for extremism and instability.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A generation ago, young Arabs went to the streets to protest repressive governments. Now, they hop on the information highway – blogging and tweeting their discontent. They upload music, download protests. But this generation is up against rulers who know a thing or two about staying in power – and they are keeping the kids in check. It's an old battle on new ground – young activists fight to express themselves as Arab governments find better ways to outflank them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>By the nineteenth century, philhellenic Europeans had appropriated the classical Greek world as their distinct cultural patrimony. However, sources composed in the late 1600s and early 1700s by Ottoman dignitaries, Greek Orthodox intellectuals, and French and English travelers reveal a more fluid period when the Greco-Roman tradition exerted an influence on the perceptions all these (sometimes overlapping) groups had of themselves and one another. Greek, Ottoman, French, and English literary texts, archival records, and visual sources thus reveal the cross-cultural currents and ties connecting members of the Ottoman intelligentsia with their counterparts in Paris and London in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Lecture given by Karen Leal, Kluge Fellow.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1957 to 1965, the master photographer W. Eugene Smith had a studio and darkroom in a dilapidated building on 6th Avenue north of 28thstreet in Manhattan.  The Jazz Loft, as it became known, had already become a favored spot for jam sessions by hundreds of jazz players of the day.  During his years there, Smith became obsessed with the goings-on in the building, musical and otherwise, and he taped and photographed them with an unimaginable thoroughness, capturing thousands of hours of sound as well as tens of thousands of images.  The sounds and stories that emerged from those years are the basis for The Jazz Loft Project, a ten-part radio series.  Hear the whole story of the Jazz Loft years in The Jazz Loft Project Radio Series.  Original air dates: 11/16/09-11/25/09</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Chants characteristic for the medieval liturgy of St. Lorenz in Nuremberg, Germany, were recorded for the first time by the Schola Hungarica, a leading ensemble for the performance of medieval chant. One of the highlights of the repertoire, also a world premier recording, is the mass formula for the feast of the Holy Lance, the most important festival celebrated annually in the city of Nuremberg between 1424 and 1524. Portions of this performance were used in a television documentary about the Holy Lance aired on Channel 2 of the BBC and on the Discovery Channel. Other chants recorded were taken from the formulas of saints venerated locally, for example, Saint Sebaldus, Saint Deocarus, Saint Martha, Saint Monica and Saint Lawrence. The recordings was produced in collaboration with Bavarian Radio, Studio Franconia and it is marketed by HNH International (Naxos).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The history of Anatolia's Alevi or Kizilbash community has long been written by outsiders who have variously portrayed them as mysterious, heretical, heterodox, or uncivilized.  Alevism has been often juxtaposed with the high religion would-be orthodox Sunni practice.  This historical understanding of Alevis has continued to influence the way these communities are represented in the present.  In this episode, Ayfer Karakaya-Stump challenges this binary.  Drawing on previously unexamined sources produced by the Ottoman Alevi community itself, she seeks a new road to understanding Alevism and the relationship of Alevi communities with the Ottoman and Safavid states, Sufi movements of the time, and the communities that surrounded them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Childhood today is often carefully choreographed. Structure, safety and control are just some of the hallmarks of modern American parenting.  The focus is on reining in children, rather than letting them run amok. But kids in the 19th century were a very different breed, according to historian Jon Grinspan. Assertive, rebellious and freewheeling, these young scamps roamed free in gangs, getting into fights, building bonfires and attacking small animals. We compare childhood then and now, with Jon Grinspan, a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellow at the Massachusetts Historical Society and Lenore Skenazy, author of Free-Range Kids: How to Raise Safe, Self-Reliant Children (Without Going Nuts with Worry).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This truly gruesome program explores the phenomenon of the execution ballad—the printed pamphlet telling, in song, the story of the crime and of the condemned.  These songs tell of the descent into vice, give account of the crime in all its appalling detail and purport to give voice to the true repentance of the doomed sinner.  In what was a profitable line of business for early printers, the songs were declaimed by the ballad seller and spruiked to the crowd who'd gathered to see the offender put to death.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Pan-Turkism rose to prominence as a political ideology during the early twentieth century, heavily influenced by Muslim intellectuals that traveled between the Russian and Ottoman spheres.  For many of these figures such as Yusuf Akçura, Ismail Gasprinski, and Ahmet Agaoglu, Pan-Turkism became the political movement that defined their legacies.  However, as James Meyer explains in his new monograph entitled Turks Across Empires, these intellectuals engaged with numerous other issues of the period well before becoming the Pan-Turkists they are remembered as today.  In this episode, Nir Shafir and Ella Fratantuono talk to James Meyer about this research and explore what the history of the Pan-Turkists tells us about the broader sociopolitical connections between Russia and the Ottoman Empire.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>At the heart of medieval political economies were a variety of practices, structures, and activities that revolved around the production and distribution of food. In this episode, Nicolas Trépanier discusses his research for Foodways and Daily Life in Medieval Anatolia, which examines life in the early Ottoman Empire through the lens of food and drink. We discuss diverse subjects from agrarian labor and temporality to religion and commerce in order to understand how people lived through what and how they ate.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Were Ottoman courts just?  Bogaç Ergene discusses this basic question in this podcast by forging a new path beyond the earlier views of the justice system as inherently fickle and capricious - immortalized in Weber's concept of kadijustiz - and the idealistic views of Ottoman courts as a site of equal and fair treatment for all.  Drawing on the results of research for his forthcoming publication with Metin Cosgel entitled The Economics of Ottoman Justice, Ergene argues for employing the quantitative methods of "law and economics" scholars, demonstrating that entrenched power holders in early modern Ottoman society were always able to use the Ottoman court system to produce outcomes favorable to themselves.</Abstract>

Jarvis called the Reconstruction Era an "often-ignored or misunderstood period in our rich history" but one that bridges the nation's Civil War and its civil rights movement. Now, the Park Service has begun chronicling the historic sites in South Carolina that tell the Reconstruction story. Michael Allen, a community partnership specialist with the National Parks Service in Charleston, will be working with groups and communities interested in taking part. He joins Dr. Edgar, along with Dr. Brent Morris, professor of history at USC Beaufort and Director of the NEH Summer Institute "America's Reconstruction: The Untold Story" to talk about facts and myths of this important period of American history.</Abstract>

I think that's another thing that this book, I hope, teaches our children: being willing to take risks because the rewards on the other side of those risks can be phenomenal."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Hundreds of cartographic images of the world and its regions exist scattered throughout collections of medieval and early modern Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts. The sheer number of these extant maps tells us that from the thirteenth century onward, when these map-manuscripts began to proliferate, visually depicting the world became a major preoccupation of medieval Muslim scholars. However, these cartographers did not strive for mimesis, that is, representation or imitation of the real world. These schematic, geometric, and often symmetrical images of the world are iconographic representations—‘carto-ideographs'—of how medieval Muslim cartographic artists and their patrons perceived their world and chose to represent and disseminate this perception. In this podcast, we sit down with Karen Pinto to discuss the maps found in the cartographically illustrated Kitab al-Masalik wa-al-Mamalik (Book of Routes and Realms) tradition, which is the first known geographic atlas of maps, its influence on Ottoman cartography, and how basic versions of these carto-ideographs were transported back to villages and far-flung areas of the Islamic empire.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Geneticists and historians are generally considered strange bedfellows. However, new advances in bio-archaeology and genetics are facilitating this odd coupling.  In this episode, we speak to Nükhet Varlik, author of Plague and Empire in the Early Modern Mediterranean World:  the Ottoman experience, 1347-1600 (Cambridge University Press), about how genetic evidence has transformed the study of the plague in the past ten years, allowing geneticists to more readily identify the presence of Yersinia pestis bacteria in human remains.  Whereas before historians had been hesitant to diagnose diseases posthumously, they can now speak with greater certainty about the presence of plague.  We then discuss the life of plague in the early modern Ottoman Empire in particular, focusing on the creation of ‘plague capitals' in the urban centers of the Ottoman Empire following the conquest of Constantinople and how integrating the Ottoman experience of plague changes the story of how historians of medicine approach the topic.  To inspire future collaborations among our listeners, we end with a peek at the process of working with geneticists and what such approaches can contribute to the study of the history of the Middle East.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Michael Rosen is joined by writer Matthew Engel and linguist Dr Lynne Murphy to discuss the Americanisation of English. Is the pace of Americanisation of British English really increasing? Why do Americans say eggplant and sidewalk, rather than aubergine and pavement? Why does your spellchecker insist it's 'color' not 'colour'? Do Americans complain about the 'Britishisms' creeping into use in the States as much as we complain about Americanisms in use in the UK? Does it really matter if British and American English begin to be used interchangeably and could we stem the flow if we tried?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Were Ottoman courts just? Bogaç Ergene discusses this basic question in this podcast by forging a new path beyond the earlier views of the justice system as inherently fickle and capricious—immortalized in Weber's concept of kadijustiz—and the idealistic views of Ottoman courts as a site of equal and fair treatment for all. Drawing on the results of research for his forthcoming publication with Metin Cosgel entitled The Economics of Ottoman Justice, Ergene argues for employing the quantitative methods of "law and economics" scholars, demonstrating that entrenched power holders in early modern Ottoman society were always able to use the Ottoman court system to produce outcomes favorable to themselves.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Do we have a soul? Is it material, like air, or immaterial, like a shadow? Are souls feminine and masculine or do they remove their gender as they exit the body? If souls resemble the body, can they be, say, blue-eyed, or blind, or white, or black? Are there infant souls in the afterworld? Do they grow up? When we sleep, does the soul leave the body to enter into an otherworldly order that we experience as a dream? Can it be trapped there, to be sold on the black market? Where does it go after death? To the bush, the domain of spirits? To the underworld, where it loses its memory? Is there a place reserved for the souls of soldiers and one for those of philosophers? Can the soul be tortured? Are stars souls? Is the soul a bird?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Questions and beliefs like these have marked people's identities, influenced how we see others, and how we divide the world. Spanish colonists, for instance, often thought that "Indians" did not have a soul, which partly explains the savagery of the colonial process. In the West, a body/soul rhetoric has evolved along with features of our civilization, a process that has marked, in particular, the humanities and the arts. (Why is medieval plainchant, for example, devoid of beat? Because beat, the clergy argued, leaps to the feet and to the hip to pollute the soul.) Changes in beliefs about the soul have also marked how we perceive reality, and even how we experience our body. Consider sexuality, for instance, an embodied experience historically regarded as a threat to the soul.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The world has seen age-old battles for the control of this body/soul rhetoric; battles that, still waged today, need our attention because they ultimately are about the social construction of reality and of features of civilization itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Adam Arenson discusses his ongoing research about African North Americans—those men and women, born free or enslaved, who crossed or re-crossed the U.S.-Canada border in the era of emancipation, Civil War, and Reconstruction.  We will discuss how difficult it is to determine how many fugitive slaves and free blacks were in Canada; the history of the more than 600 African North Americans who returned to fight for the U.S. Colored Troops; the thousands more who returned to the United States in the decades that followed; the hundreds of men, women, and children who traveled north to Canada  after emancipation; and even the reason Civil War records are filled with fake claims of Canadian and other citizenship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein introduced the world to archetypes we're still familiar with: the mad scientist and his terrifying creation. But the novel is more than just a horror classic. It also asks questions about the ethics of scientific and technological innovation–questions that we still struggle with today.  On this episode of Examining Ethics, we explore one of these questions: is it wrong for scientists and innovators to work or create in isolation? First, we introduce you to "sociability," an important, behavior-shaping idea in the scientific community of the nineteenth century. Then, we discuss whether scientists and innovators working today have similar ethical obligations. We cover things like the importance of transparency in the ethics of scientific and technological innovation. We also explore the value of democratic oversight to the world of science and technology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Pirates are usually imagined as outlaws. But as the history of the early modern Mediterranean demonstrates, the line between illegal raiding and legitimate maritime violence was blurry, easily crossed, and often a moving target. In this episode, we talk to Joshua White about his book Piracy and Law in the Ottoman Mediterranean. We consider how piracy shaped legal institutions and thought in the Ottoman world, and we get a glimpse of the fascinating and liminal world of pirates, jurists, and officials in the Ottoman Mediterranean.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Liturgy of Lay Foundations in Ghent 1400-1500  Did the laity control worship at church altars outside the main choir in Ghent in the century before the Reformation? How can these lay liturgies be categorized? Were they always votive? In this presentation, I explore the liturgies of a variety of lay foundations and the extent to which they were personal, private, communal, or of political consequence. I argue for a different understanding of late-medieval liturgy, one that is mindful of those physically present or not and their role, and of such events as bread distributions, or essential objects, including paintings. Discussed are the liturgy for the dead and for series of votive masses, for the Mandatum, and for two foundations of wider import, that for a mass before the Adoration of the Lamb, and for a new Marian feast, the 'Recollectio festorum beate Marie virginis.'</Abstract>

		<Abstract>About once a year I turn to one particularly tattered book, its red cover worn, its two halves taped together after falling apart from frequent use years ago.  Like so many others through generations, I return to this book again and again, called to it by some inexplicable yearning for a life I never had, a nostalgia for a time I didn't experience, and a desire to learn and mature with the characters. Though I have never been able to choose a "favorite book," I have always known that if I had to be stuck on a desert island — with only one book to bring with me — it would be this one: Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott. Each time I read it, I discover something new and wonderful while simultaneously communing with the familiar and beloved.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>George Gershwin composed his Rhapsody in Blue in 1924. In the same year, he launched his collaboration with his brother Ira, which produced countless songs. He never achieved his ambition of studying with Maurice Ravel, but was always enthralled by the symphonic poem and the concerto. His masterpieces, such as An American in Paris and the opera Porgy and Bess, greatly enriched the American musical heritage. Jos van Immerseel has always been fascinated by Gershwin, but it was the appearance of a new edition of the scores that prompted the pianist and conductor to record this extensive homage. Thanks to the very latest research undertaken by the University of Michigan, the Library of Congress and the Gershwin Estate, he and his companions in Anima Eterna have got closer than ever before to the composer's intentions, making use of the appropriate instruments. This CD includes the international premiere recording of the Gershwin Critical Edition's Rhapsody in Blue (1924 Jazz) and An American in Paris.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On May 31, 1921, white mobs launched an attack on the Greenwood section of Tulsa, Oklahoma. In less than 24 hours, the mobs destroyed more than 1,000 homes and businesses. It's estimated as many as 300 people were killed. The Tulsa Race Riot is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history. Olivia Hooker was just 6-years-old at the time. Now, at 103, she is the last surviving witness to the events of that day. This story is part of our new series, Last Witness, portraits of the last surviving witnesses to history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the war in Vietnam, there was a notorious American military prison on the outskirts of Saigon called Long Binh Jail. But LBJ wasn't for captured enemy fighters, it was for American soldiers. These were men who had broken military law. And there were a lot of them. As the unpopular war dragged on, discipline frayed and soldiers started to rebel. By the summer of 1968, over half the men in Long Binh Jail were locked up on AWOL charges. Some were there for more serious crimes, others for small stuff, like refusing to get a haircut. The stockade had become extremely overcrowded. Originally built to house 400 inmates, it became crammed with over 700 men, more than half African American. On August 29th, 1968, the situation erupted. This story aired on the 50th anniversary of the Long Binh Jail uprising.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On August 6, 1945 the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. It was the first time a nuclear weapon had been used in warfare. There were three strike planes that flew over Hiroshima that day: the Enola Gay which carried the bomb, and two observation planes, the Great Artiste and the Necessary Evil. But most of the 34 crew-members didn't know that they were carrying the most powerful weapon in the world. Russell Gackenbach was a second lieutenant and a navigator on the Necessary Evil. Today, he is the only surviving member of the mission. This story aired as part of our Last Witness series.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A new story from our series The Working Tapes.  In the early 1970's, author Studs Terkel interviewed the owners of Duke &amp;amp; Lee's Auto Repair in Geneva, Illinois for his book Working. He went to talk to them about fixing cars. What he found was a story about fathers and sons working together… and the tensions within a family business. We at Radio Diaries, went back to Duke &amp;amp; Lee's four decades later and found the family business still intact — tensions at all.  Studs recorded more than 130 interviews for Working, but most of them have never been heard. A few years ago, Radio Diaries and Project&amp;amp; were given access to all the raw field recordings and combed through the archive to produce, The Working Tapes. Find Parts 1 – 3 of that series on past episodes of the Radio Diaries Podcast.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1968, Mexico City was preparing to host the Olympics. It was the first time that a Latin American country would host the Games, and the government was hoping to show off the new, modern, Mexico.  At the same time, student protests were regularly sweeping through the streets of Mexico City. And just 10 days before the Olympics were to begin, on October 2, the Mexican army fired on a peaceful student demonstration in the Tlatelolco neighborhood. The official announcement was that four students were dead, but eyewitnesses said they saw hundred of dead bodies being trucked away. The Tlatelolco Massacre is one of the darkest episodes in Mexican history. Over the years, the death toll isn't the only thing the government has covered up.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On September 18, 1980, two Air Force mechanics entered the Titan II missile silo in Damascus, Arkansas. While conduct routine maintenance, they dropped a wrench. The wrench set off an explosion which killed one airman, destroyed the entire base, and sent the warhead flying 700 yards where it landed in a ditch. It was an accident that – had the warhead gone off – could have taken out half the state of Arkansas. This is a story of an accident, but it's also a story about the dangers we still live with today, and how hard it is to really comprehend risk and probability when the consequences are almost unimaginable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1965, an underground network formed in Chicago to help pregnant women get abortions. At first, they connected women with doctors willing to break the law to perform the procedure. Eventually, they were trained and began performing abortions themselves. The group called itself "Jane." Over the years, Jane performed more than 11,000 first and second trimester abortions.</Abstract>

We include an interview with Princeton Professor Tom Levin, director of the Phone-Post Archive which houses more than 4,000 of these unique records. Levin shares the historical significance of this ephemeral technology and makes a case for preserving it. We explore more of what the archive has to offer and feature recordings that did not fit into the original broadcast.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Throughout American history, one of the most important job qualifications for the office of President has been knowing how to talk. You have to be able to deliver a speech that will rally the people.  For Lincoln it was: "Four score and seven years ago," FDR had: "A date which will live in infamy." JFK asked, "Ask not what your country can do for you…" You get the idea.  But one of the most influential speeches in American political history is one most people have never even heard of: William Jennings Bryan's "Cross of Gold" speech. In this episode, we bring you the story of Bryan's epic speech, plus the story of the presidential campaign of 1952 when a fondness for oratory doomed the candidacy of Adlai Stevenson.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nowadays we're very accustomed to recording and hearing the sound of our own voices. But in the 1930s many people were doing it for the first time. And a surprising trend began. People started sending their voices to each other, through the postal service. It was literally: Voice-Mail. This story explores an archive of this ephemeral technology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1921, music publisher Harry H. Pace started the first major black-owned record label in the United States. In just two years, Black Swan Records released more than 180 records and helped launch the careers of Fletcher Henderson and Ethel Waters. But when Black Swan folded, Pace's life took a turn and he began passing for white. This story goes back to a pivotal moment in music history and the effect it had on one family's identity. Black Swan Records will air on NPR in Spring 2019. We are including a sample of the story here.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On June 15, 1904, a steamship called the General Slocum left the pier on East Third Street in New York City just after 9 AM. The boat was filled with more than 1,300 residents of the Lower East Side. Many of the passengers were recent German immigrants who were headed up the east river for a church outing, a boat cruise and picnic on Long Island. But they would never make it. We interviewed the last living survivor of the General Slocum, Adella Wotherspoon, when she was 100 years old. Today we're bringing you her story as part of our series, Last Witness. Plus, a portrait of the last civilian lighthouse keeper in the U.S.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A record-breaking number of women ran for Congress in the midterm elections this November. There are 257, dwarfing all previous years. And in 2020, we'll likely see a record number of women running for President as well. It's a historic moment for women in politics. But what many people don't know is that - over the years - there have actually been more than 35 women who have run for President. Today on the show we have three stories of women who launched bids to be President of the United States: Victoria Woodhull, Margaret Chase Smith, and Shirley Chisholm.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On February 20, 1939, the marquee of Madison Square Garden was lit up with the evening's main event: a "Pro-American Rally." The organizers had chosen the date in celebration of George Washington's birthday. 20,000 men and women streamed inside and took their seats. The view they had was stunning: a 30-foot-tall banner of Washington hung between American flags and two huge swastikas. It was the eve of World War II. The rally was sponsored by the German American Bund, one of several American organizations that openly supported Fascism and Hitler. Eighty years later, we tell the story of the rally at The Garden.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The FBI has joined the investigation into the murder of three women and six children in Northern Mexico last week by suspected cartel gunmen. The victims were dual US-Mexico citizens from a community that identifies as "Mormon" but is not affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Last week on Top of Mind, we spoke with an expert on the independent –or fundamentalist –Mormon communities in Mexico –some who practice polygamy, some who don't. There's also a community of Mormons who are actively affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and have been rooted for generations on both sides of the US-Mexico border. They are a fascinating example of the way many people living at border see it as a fluid boundary, not at all clear-cut.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>BUTTE'S JEWISH COMMUNITY  Since 2011, the Butte-Silver Bow Public has worked with the ethnic communities in Butte and created an exhibit for each dedicated to their heritage. In 2019, the Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives and the Montana Preservation Alliance received a National Endowment for the Humanities Common Heritage grant to continue this work on Butte's underrepresented communities: the Jewish, Finnish, German, and Hispanics of Butte.  This is the story of Butte's Jewish community produced with the congregation of B'nai Israel Synagogue. We'll explore the culture, religion, and impact of the Jewish on Butte's community. Over the decades, the Jewish population of Butte has dwindled, but the B'nai Israel congregation proudly keeps their traditions alive—holding worship services regularly and celebrating High Holy Days and life events for all members of the community.</Abstract>

In 2019, the Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives and the Montana Preservation Alliance received a National Endowment for the Humanities Common Heritage grant to continue this work on Butte's underrepresented communities This project culminates in a four-part radio series funded by the Greater Montana Foundation to share the stories of the people who contributed to Butte's melting pot.  This is the story of Butte's Finnish community. The Archives sat down with members of Butte's Finnish families who told us all about their culture, neighborhood, and businesses in Finn Town. Although most of Finn Town is gone today, memories of the neighborhood are alive and well within its people.  The program covers immigration and settlement, neighborhoods, buildings and business, boarding houses, food and the sauna culture of the Finn community</Abstract>

In 2019, the Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives and the Montana Preservation Alliance received a National Endowment for the Humanities Common Heritage grant  This is the story of Butte's Hispanic community. The Archives sat down with members of Butte's Hispanic families who told us all about their culture, neighborhood, and memories of growing up in Butte.  Many of the participants fondly remembered their mother making tortillas in the kitchen or grinding peppers in their molcajete and attending church at Sacred Heart and St. Joseph's. One thing all the participants had in common was the work ethic their ancestors had and passed down through the generations. Topics within this program are immigration and migration, food and traditions, neighborhood life, activism, religion and fiestas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since 2011, the Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives has worked with the ethnic communities in Butte and created an exhibit for each dedicated to their heritage. In 2019, the Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives and the Montana Preservation Alliance received a National Endowment for the Humanities Common Heritage grant.  The Archives held two-day events, where they invited speakers, collected stories and artifacts from each of the ethnic communities, and hosted an exhibit. This project culminates in a four-part radio series funded by the Greater Montana Foundation to share the stories of the people who contributed to Butte's melting pot.     This is the story of Butte's German community. The Archives sat down with members of Butte's German families who told us all about their culture, neighborhood, and businesses in Butte.  The topics covered immigration &amp;amp; settlements, displaced persons, neighborhoods, culture and religion, traditions, clubs and societies, the effect of sedition and War on German immigrants, the businesses of the butchers, bakers, and brewers of Butte.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1969, Grace Halsell, a white journalist, published a book called Soul Sister. It was her account of living as a "black woman" in the United States. Lyndon Johnson provided a blurb for the book, and it sold over a million copies. Halsell's book was praised for bringing attention to the treatment of black women in the south, and harshly criticized for putting herself at the center of that narrative. On this extended version of the podcast, we tell the story of Grace Halsell and explore the larger debate of "journalistic blackface" with historians Robin Kelley and Alisha Gaines. This episode was a partnership with NPR's Code Switch podcast.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On November 13, 1969, Spiro Agnew delivered the most famous speech ever given by a vice president. His message: the media is biased. President Nixon was getting beaten up by the press, and in response, his administration had been trying to undercut the credibility of the media, especially television news. The war between politicians and the media has a long history. This story was released as a two-part episode along with the story of Adlai Stevenson, a presidential candidate doomed to fail on this new-fangled thing called television.</Abstract>

Daisy Anderson was black, her husband was a slave who escaped and joined the Union Army. Alberta Martin was white, her husband fought on the Confederate side. Daisy and Alberta were not alive during the Civil War. But they married into history. This story was released on the podcast as a two part episode along with the portrait of Olivia Hooker, the last surviving witness to Tulsa Race Riot.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Piracy is often depicted as a facet of the wild, lawless expanses of the high seas. But in this episode, we explore the order that governed piracy, captivity, and ransom in the early modern Mediterranean and in turn, how these practices shaped early modern politics, Mediterranean connections, and the emergent notions of international law. Emrah Safa Gürkan talks about Ottoman corsairs and the practicalities of piracy in the early modern Mediterranean. Joshua White discusses facets of Islamic law and gender in the realm of piracy. And Daniel Hershenzon explores the paradoxical connections forged by slavery, captivity, and ransom on both sides of the Mediterranean.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The plague is caused by a bacteria called Yersinia pestis, which lives in fleas that in turn live on rodents. Coronavirus is not the plague. Nonetheless, we can find many parallels between the current pandemic and the experience of plague for people who lived centuries ago. This special episode of Ottoman History Podcast brings together lessons from our past episodes on plague and disease in the early modern Mediterranean. Our guests offer state of the art perspectives on the history of plague in the Ottoman Empire, and many of their observations may also be useful for thinking about epidemics in the present day.    For instructors and students, we encourage you to listen with our comprehension and discussion questions in this GoogleDoc.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The EUME project of Türkyilmaz traces the contacts and confluences of Armenian Genocide scholarship and historiography with the broader body of literature on collective violence, and especially with the Holocaust Studies. Despite the common tendency to employ a blueprint of the Holocaust as an archetype, ironically, the dialogue between the Holocaust and Armenian Genocide studies has been scant. In contrast, the framework here pays particular attention to the ways in which critical genocide studies and especially contemporary Holocaust studies, that increasingly highlight the intricacies and paradoxes of decision making processes, can offer us new avenues for analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This week, we explore the ancestor of public radio in the United States: educational radio. Our guest, Stephanie Sapienza, helps to bring educational radio archives to life through her work on the multi-institution "Unlocking the Airwaves" project. As Digital Humanities Archivist at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at University of Maryland, Sapienza is working with audio from the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB). She describes the breadth of materials in the collection and its role in public radio history and also shares more about her unique (and entertaining) presentation at the Orphan Film Symposium in which she reported on old time educational radio in an old time radio style.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since the late 1970s, the Iowa Labor History Oral Project has been collecting interviews from the working class across Iowa. They are collecting history from the ground up, as opposed to leaders or people with power. "We have access to new kinds of sources, including those of the Iowa Labor History Oral Project, that enable us to get at the experience of ordinary people, of everyday working people," said Shelton Stromquist, Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Iowa, "whose work lives, whose organizing, whose building of unions in many cases is really an integral part of the fabric of our state and of the nation."  On this edition of River to River, host Ben Kieffer speaks with Stromquist and the Oral and Public Historian at the Iowa Labor Center, John McKerly, about Iowa's rich labor history. During this conversation Kieffer, Stromquist and McKerly highlight six individuals from the collection whose stories, when put together, help best tell Iowa's labor history.  "There are interviews that touch literally every town and city in the state and every realm of work and labor union acitivity," said Stromquist, "I don't know of another collection in the country that has that character."     Guests include: John McKerley, Oral and Public Historian at the Iowa Labor Center Shelton Stromquist, Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Iowa</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1974, oral historian Studs Terkel published a book with an unwieldy title: "Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They do." This collective portrait of America was based on more than a hundred interviews Studs did around the country. He recorded all of his interviews on a reel-to-reel tape recorder, but after the book came out, the tapes were packed away and forgotten for decades. Radio Diaries and our partners at Project&amp;amp; were given exclusive access to the tapes for a series called The Working Tapes. For this episode of the Radio Diaries Podcast, we produced an hour-long version of the series, with content that couldn't fit in the original broadcasts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On March 1, 1954, four people launched on armed attack on the U.S. Capitol. The insurgents, all young Puerto Rican nationalists from New York, fired more than two dozen bullets into the House of Representatives chamber in a plot to bring attention to the fight for Puerto Rico's independence. Five members of Congress were wounded in the assault. We bring to light what happened in the chamber that day using oral history interviews with eye witnesses. This story was the result of a partnership with the Office of the House Historian (U.S. House of Representatives) which houses a rich collection of archival audio.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On August 28, 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was brutally murdered, a crime that served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. But Till's death was not the first racially motivated killing in Mississippi that year, and it wouldn't be the last. Just three months later, about 20 miles down the road, 33-year-old Clinton Melton was shot and killed at the gas station where he worked. Two eye witnesses identified Elmer Otis Kimball as his murderer, a white man involved in Till's death earlier that year. 65 years after the Mississippi murders, we share the story of Clinton Melton, his wife Beulah, and the four children they left behind.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On February 20, 1939, a rally took place inside Madison Square Garden. 20,000 people showed their support for Hitler and the Nazi Party. Outside on the streets, there were even more protestors and police on horseback. At the time, it was the largest deployment of police in New York City history. Fights were breaking out between fascists and anti-fascists. And one fight was particularly memorable. On this extended episode of the Radio Diaries Podcast, we share two stories from inside and outside The Garden.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Séances, clairvoyance, and telepathy captivated public imagination in the United States from the 1850s well into the twentieth century. Though skeptics dismissed these experiences as delusions, a new kind of investigator emerged to seek the science behind such phenomena. With new technologies like the telegraph collapsing the boundaries of time and space, an explanation seemed within reach. As Americans took up psychical experiments in their homes, the boundaries of the mind began to waver. Common Phantoms: An American History of Psychic Science (Stanford UP, 2020) brings these experiments back to life while modeling a new approach to the history of psychology and the mind sciences.  Drawing on previously untapped archives of participant-reported data, Alicia Puglionesi recounts how an eclectic group of investigators tried to capture the most elusive dimensions of human consciousness. A vast though flawed experiment in democratic science, psychical research gave participants valuable tools with which to study their experiences on their own terms. Academic psychology would ultimately disown this effort as both a scientific failure and a remnant of magical thinking, but its challenge to the limits of science, the mind, and the soul still reverberates today.  Claire Clark is a medical educator, historian of medicine, and associate professor in the University of Kentucky's College of Medicine. She teaches and writes about health behavior in historical context.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From ancient Egypt to Greek mythology, through Abrahamic religions, in ancient African and Native American spiritual traditions, in medieval Europe, and 16th century France (remember that Nostradamus guy?), humans have reliably attempted to predict the future, read minds, and communicate with the dead.  And at this moment in our history, with a pandemic, protests, an upcoming election, climate change... On top of the innate chaos of being a human being, it would surely be more psychologically manageable if we could somehow see into the future.  This hour, you'll listen in on my first reading ever with a psychic medium - someone who claims to be able to predict the future, and communicate with the dead. We'll hear what this work is like for her. You'll also meet a researcher who looks back at some of the ways psychics and mediums have been tested and understood - or not - in American history.  Guests: Karen Hollis is a Rocky Hill-based psychic medium who has worked with over 7,000 clients, as well as the police. She's appeared on the Discovery Channel and the Travel Channel, and she's worked with the Ghosts of New England Research Society, or G.O.N.E.R.S.  Alicia Puglionesi is the author of the forthcoming book, Common Phantoms: An American History of Psychic Science, exploring questions of faith and doubt, orthodoxy and marginality that underpin the field of parapsychology</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Alicia Puglionesi is a writer and historian whose book Common Phantoms: An American History of Psychic Science tells the story of how researchers in the late 19th and early 20th century attempted to engage the outer limits of human consciousness, and how their efforts were written out of "legitimate" academic discourse. In this conversation, she explains how this lost history of psychic experimentation resonates in 21st century politics and culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a pandemic, prison is one of the worst places a person could be. Social distancing is almost impossible. Prisons are often overcrowded – bathrooms and public spaces are shared by hundreds of people. Guards are constantly going in and out.  Robbie Pollock spent 8 years in New York state prisons. Recently, he spoke with his friend Moe Monsuri, who has been incarcerated since 2007. Moe is serving his time at Sing Sing, a maximum security prison in upstate New York, where four people have died of COVID-19. Robbie and Moe talked about what it's like to experience a pandemic when you're behind bars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The psychotherapist Esther Perel recently said that disasters operate like "relationship accelerators." They cause both a spike in divorce and a spike in marriages and babies. Most of us are hunkering down with people we already have some sort of relationship with, but a few people have chosen to hunker down with practical strangers.  Gali Beeri is 37 and works as an executive assistant. Joshua Boliver is 42 and does visual effects for movies. They both live in New York City. In March, as the city was preparing to lock down, they made the unlikely decision to quarantine together after their very first date.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The painter Georgia O'Keeffe is known for her bold paintings of landscapes and flowers. When talking about those famous flowers, she said: "Nobody sees a flower–really–it is so small–we haven't time–and to see takes time like to have a friend takes time."  She took her small observations and filled her canvas with bright colors and close-ups, so those flowers couldn't be missed. Recently, scientists took a closer look at those paintings and noticed smaller details that O'Keeffe did not intend to include. They found "art acne"—small pock marks—on many of her paintings caused by age and reactions of the pigments. Marc Walton, co-director of the Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts at Northwestern University and Art Institute of Chicago, talks about the chemistry behind the "art acne," and how these paintings might be conserved in the future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bessie Smith: Empress of the Blues. Smith was called the Empress of the Blues, but she was also the highest paid African American entertainer of her generation. We explored her life from her early days performing on Chattanooga street corners and her travels on the TOBA circuit to her decade as a top selling recording artist. An interview with NYU cultural anthropologist Maureen Mahon, whose research interests include African American music and culture; the construction and performance of race and gender in music; and the relationship between race, class, generation, and culture, sheds light on Smith's impact on music. Archival interviews with musicians who worked with Smith and recent interviews with musicians influenced by her illustrate her importance and her experience. For this program we found a great deal of support from the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane University.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ellis Marsalis Remembered: Family Memories and Music: There is no more recognizable family name in jazz from New Orleans and beyond than Marsalis. This program paid tribute to pianist and Marsalis family patriarch Ellis Marsalis Jr. who passed away from Covid-19 in April 2020, and to his musical offspring sons Branford (saxophone), Wynton (trumpet), Delfeayo (trombone) and Jason (drums and vibraphone). The conversation explores coming of age in a family of musicians, with expectations of performing at the highest level, to the culture of the interplay of traditional and modern jazz in New Orleans. Previously unheard are Wynton's remarkable memorial oration and a live set with youngest son Jason Marsalis playing the music of his late father. It's the enduring and thriving musical legacy of the Marsalis family.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Santana Speaks: This program is a biography of Carlos Santana whose music represents a true musical fusion of various influences including Latin instruments, Afro beats, and blues-style solo guitar. He discusses playing music on the streets of Tijuana and on the stage at Woodstock. He discusses how he absorbed the various cultures and musics around him in San Francisco, and his hopes for a global society explored on his new album Africa Speaks. In the interview Santana cites the legendary Tito Puente as one of his cultural and musical heros. For perspective, we drew from an archival interview with the late Tito Puente, el Rey de los Timbales, about the roots of tropical Latin jazz in Spanish Harlem and how he brought his instrument, the timbales, to the foreground by moving them from the back to the front of the stage. Steve Berlin and Cesar Rosas are included to discuss Los Lobos and their mix of American pop and Mexican traditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After the Storm: Katrina at 15: 15 years ago Hurricane Katrina and levee failures covered 80% of New Orleans in water. The storm left a huge human and ecological disaster in its wake. American Routes staff produced was forced to evacuate our studios and our city but never halted production. The noted American Routes After the Storm series that came out of that tragedy offered displaced and depressed South Louisianians comfort and remembrances of home. Now 15 years later, we take a look back at the catastrophe, recovery and renewed hope for the culture of the Crescent City with another edition of this series. The series includes conversations with Irma Thomas, the Rebirth Brass Band, archived interviews with now deceased Dr. John and Alan Toussaint and archival audio from our first broadcast After the Storm in September 2005.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>American Routes Live: As the quarantine continued, through tracking listener comments we recognized a need for more human contact and felt that more live performance could help. We partnered with the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park and the Jean Lafitte National Park to produce a series of socially-distanced performances and artist interviews, some outside in an old firehouse yard and most in the large, well-ventilated Esplanade Studios. The programs were live-streamed with strong AV production on NPS's Jazz Park Facebook and post-produced into American Routes performance programs. One such program featured outdoor, socially distanced interviews with Leyla McCalla and Donald Harrison, each of whom bring their family heritage forward into contemporary music, livestreamed on social media and recorded to create an American Routes program. These interviews also addressed current events through a historical cultural lens and shows the pivot we made during Covid challenges. Singer McCalla discussed how she draws on French Creole roots for inspiration, as well as from the poetry of Langston Hughes. Jazz saxophonist Big Chief Donald Harrison, discussed "Afro-New Orleans" culture and demonstrated how to bring soul, funk, and Black carnival traditions into modern jazz.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1985, Gert McMullin was one of the first San Franciscans to put a stitch on the AIDS Quilt, the quilt that began with one memorial square in honor of a man who had died of AIDS, and that now holds some 95,000 names. Gert never planned it this way, but over the decades she has become the Keeper of the Quilt and has stewarded it, repaired it, tended it, traveled with it and conserved it for some 33 years now.    In 2020, when COVID-19 hit, Gert was one of the first Bay Area citizens to begin sewing masks—PPE for nurses and health care workers who were lacking proper protection—masks she makes from fabric left over from the making of the AIDS Quilt. The comfort, outrage and honoring of an earlier pandemic being used to protect people from a new one.  In January of 2020 The AIDS Memorial Quilt, now part of The National AIDS Memorial, returned home to the Bay Area after 16 years in Atlanta. It took six 52-foot semis to get it there. The over sixty tons of quilt, is made up of about 48,000 panels, each 3 x 6 feet, the size of a grave. The extensive AIDS Archive, which Gert gathered, collected and protected since its earliest days, is now part of The American Folklife Center at The Library of Congress in Washington, DC.  The story of Gert McMullin and the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the Gay Rights Movement in San Francisco, Harvey Milk, The White Night Riots. With interviews with LGBT Rights activist Cleve Jones who worked with Harvey Milk and conceived of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and John Cunningham, Executive Director of the National AIDS Memorial.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Picture this: 131 young people, 13 to 26 years old, from 37 countries—youth activists from around the globe— students, writers, poets, marchers, community leaders all gathered together in San Juan, Puerto Rico in August 2019, the week after the scandal-ridden government of Governor Ricardo Rosselló fell. A government brought down in large measure because of the resolve and activism of young people across the Hurricane Maria-battered island.  This wasn't part of the plan for the second meeting of the International Congress of Youth Voices. It was pure coincidence. But here they all are, coming from across the planet to learn from one another and an array of artists, writers and activists, to create a network, to tell their stories, to listen and to understand the forces that led this island to erupt.  Politics of the world affect young people as much as anyone else, and they have little to no voice as major decisions are made. The International Congress of Youth Voices was founded as a means to amplify their ideas and energy and to unite young people for a weekend of collaboration.  The International Congress of Youth Voices, founded by author Dave Eggers (co-founder of 826 National) and nonprofit leader Amanda Uhle, gathers the world's most inspiring teen writers and activists. They come from all over the world, including: Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, the United States, Colombia, Guatemala, Cuba, Australia, Denmark, Nepal, Russia, England, Thailand, South Africa, Ireland, Canada, Uganda, Pakistan, Burundi, France, India, and Puerto Rico.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We go to New Orleans for a kind of biblical reckoning. A story of science and prayer, with a cast of improbable partners—environmental architects and nuns—coming together to create a vision forward for living with water in New Orleans. Mirabeau Water Garden, one of the largest urban wetlands in the country designed to educate, inspire and to save its neighborhood from flooding.  New Orleans. Surrounded by The Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, besieged by hurricanes and tropical storms, permeated with man made canals, levees, pumping stations …. Water is a deep and controversial issue in New Orleans. What to do with it. Where to put it. How to get rid of it? How to live with it?  David Waggonner, of Waggonner &amp;amp; Ball Architecture &amp;amp; Environment has been thinking and dreaming about these questions for years. One of the primary architects behind the Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan, David envisions floating streets, pervious pavement, planting bioswales—Keeping the Water—"living with water" rather than pushing it down and pumping it out.  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina the Sisters of St. Joseph convent in New Orleans was under 8 feet of water. A year later, on a clear blue day, the building was struck by lightning. The Sisters prayed for a sign. And in walked David Waggonner with a vision.  The Mirabeau Water Garden will become one of the largest urban wetlands in the country and a campus for water research and environmental education, demonstrating best practices for construction and urban water management in the city's lowest-lying and most vulnerable neighborhoods.  The 25-acre parcel was donated to the City of New Orleans by the Sisters of Saint Joseph on condition that it be used to enhance and protect the neighborhood to "evoke a huge systemic shift in the way humans relate with water and land."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Music and poetry were powerful headliners at the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris signaling change and new beginnings. This was not the first time the arts have reflected the mood of the country and a new administration.  In January 1973, following the Christmas bombing of Vietnam, conductor Leonard Bernstein performed in an "anti-inaugural concert" protesting Richard Nixon's official inaugural concert and his escalation of the war in Vietnam.    In 1973, the United States was reaching the concluding stages of our involvement in Vietnam. And while the war would soon come to an end, the weeks leading up to the second inauguration of Richard Nixon were met with some of the most intense and deadly bombing campaigns of the war.  The anti-war movement was unhinged. They had marched, they protested — to seemingly no avail when it came to changing Nixon's foreign policies. So what to do next...  Leonard Bernstein,  a "Keeper of Peace," gathered an impromptu orchestra for an "anti-inaugural concert"— a concert for peace—following his belief that by creating beauty, and by sharing it with as many people as possible, artists had the power to tip the earthly balance in favor of brotherhood and peace.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For Winona LaDuke the best part of running for Vice President in 1996 and 2000 on the Green Party ticket with Ralph Nadar was meeting so many people who really want to see a democracy that works—who really want to vote for someone they believe in. At rallies women would bring their daughters up to Winona saying, ‘We want them to grow up and be like you.'  Ojibwe leader, writer, food activist, rural development economist, environmentalist, Harvard graduate, —Winona, which means first born daughter, is a force to be reckoned with. She's the founder of the White Earth Land Recovery Project and the executive director of Honor the Earth. Most recently she was a leader at Standing Rock fighting the Dakota Access pipeline. She's a visionary and a fighter and she's in it for the long haul.  Born in Los Angeles and raised in Oregon, Winona moved to White Earth, her father's reservation, after she graduated from Harvard in 1982. When she first arrived, she worked as the principal of the Reservation's high school and became active in local issues. Seven years later, she started the non profit White Earth Land Recovery Project, dedicated to restoring the local economy and food systems and preserving wild rice.  Today Winona LaDuke operates a 40-acre industrial hemp farm on the White Earth Indian Reservation with the idea of creating textiles for the people and the planet — of working towards a non petroleum based future. And she's started 8th Fire Solar, operated by Anishinaabe, manufacturing solar thermal panels.  "According to Anishinaabe prophecies, we are in the time of the Seventh Fire. At this time, it is said we have a choice between a path that is well-worn and scorched, and a path that is green and unworn. If we move toward the green path, the Eighth Fire will be lit and people will come together to make a better future."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As the pandemic raged, PPE was scarce and the supply chains were breaking down. Every hospital was scrambling to find enough masks, gowns and face shields. A New York Times headline caught our eye: Sugarcreek, Ohio.   "Abe Make a Sewing Frolic" — In Ohio The Amish Take on the Coronavirus.  This isolated, centuries old, self reliant Amish community—Keepers of Community and a fast disappearing way of life—was rising to the occasion and collaborating with the world outside to fill the PPE needs of the massive Cleveland Clinic and beyond.    In the attempt to record this story in Amish country in the midst of social distancing and the ever deepening pandemic, a new collaboration was born — artist Laurie Anderson, Ohio-born designer Stacy Hoover and producer Evan Jacoby all joined with The Kitchen Sisters to bring these voices to air.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A mushroom farmer, food activist, business entrepreneur, foster mother to more than a dozen girls—Chido Govera is a kitchen visionary in Zimbabwe—a pioneer in the cultivation of mushrooms throughout Africa and the world.  Chido was orphaned at 7 when her mother died of AIDS. As a girl, who never had enough to eat, she began cultivating mushrooms when she was nine. Some people look at a mushroom and see a mushroom. Chido looked at a mushroom and saw a weapon for social change, a path out of hunger and poverty to empowerment and income for herself and other orphaned girls.  The Keeper and founder of The Future of Hope Foundation, Chido has promoted mushroom cultivation as a sustainable source of food and income in impoverished regions of the world.  We met Chido in Sao Paolo at FRUTO, an international gathering of chefs, farmers, activists, fishermen, Amazonian tribal women organizers, botanists and more—organized by Brazilian chef Alex Atala, famous from Netflix's Chef's Table. Speakers from around the world delved deep into issues of food, zero waste, the destruction of coastal waters, agriculture and climate change, the rights and foods of indigenous people of the Amazon. The conference was profound—a global eye opener.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Francis Ford Coppola talks about homelessness, life, friendship, neighborhood history, and his ideas about the future as he tells the remarkable story of North Beach Citizens, Keepers of Community—the volunteer organization he spearheaded twenty years ago to help grapple with the lives and needs of homeless and unhoused people living in his neighborhood in San Francisco.  This month marks the 20th Anniversary of North Beach Citizens. Normally at this time of year some 400 people gather in the church basement of Saints Peter &amp;amp; Paul near Washington Square Park for an epic community dinner that raises the funds to keep NBC's vital series of services available. Like everywhere, the pandemic has been hard on the unhoused and raised their numbers by some 64% in North Beach alone. The need is great.  As a frontline service provider, NBC is distributing nearly 3 times more food to the community than this time last year through daily meals "to-go," and Wednesday Community Food Pantry. As a beacon of support for the neighborhood, they ensure that people who are living close to the margins know that they are part of a caring community and connected to support that meets their individual needs.  Our story takes us deep into the North Beach community with interviews with North Beach Citizens, volunteers, staff, clients—food writer and long time North Beach resident Peggy Knickerbocker, poetry and stories of Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the supporter and Guardian Angel of North Beach Citizens, and more.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Marta Valier produced and hosted this series based on oral histories with people that lived in El Salvador during the liberation war (1980–1992). The 1970s brought to El Salvador increasing government repression, including the creation of government-organized death squads to combat opposition movements and in 1980 a series of failed military juntas took power. By 1981, leftist guerrillas and political groups joined forces, forming the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, the FMLN. Then, throughout the 1980s, a civil war was waged between the FMLN and the U.S.-backed Salvadoran military forces.</Abstract>

In the second chapter, we keep following Linda Garrett and we meet Carlos Henríquez Consalvi, known as Santiago, who also traveled to San Salvador from Nicaragua with the intention to establish Radio Venceremos, a radio station that operated in areas controlled by the insurgency and that he kept clandestine for 11 years. The third chapter centers on El Rescate human rights representative Linda Garrett’s encounter with Salvadoran political prisoner Héctor Bernabé Recinos Aguirre, illegally detained for more than four years for organizing the first national strike in 1980.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>If you've heard the news in the past few months, you've probably heard that we're "living in historic times." But what exactly does that mean?   While we generally think of history as the past, a new project by Little Rock's Mosaic Templars Cultural Center reminds us that history is all around us, even today.   "COVID In Black: The African-American Experience In Arkansas" seeks to preserve the present for the benefit of the future. The project, supported in part by the Arkansas Humanities Council, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Congress, calls on Black Arkansans for submissions of items that may seem everyday, but underscore the the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on minority populations.   Arts Scene caught up with Mosaic Templars Cultural Center Executive Director Christina Shutt to talk about the project, and what messages she hopes future historians will take away from today's historical artifacts.   Arkansans can submit their donations to the project via Facebook or by emailing info@mosaictemplarscenter.com.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>President Donald J. Trump's promise to build a border wall between the US and Mexico and his move to deport undocumented immigrants shows what a powerful hold immigration has on the American political imagination. It isn't the first time a politician promised to build a wall against immigrants. In 1936, Colorado Governor "Big Ed" Johnson declared martial law as he attempted to close the state's border with New Mexico to prevent "immigrants" from coming to Colorado. We'll explore that historical episode and how it worked out.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In late 1894, three sex workers were found strangled in their homes on Denver's notorious Market Street: Lena Tapper, Marie Contassoit, and Kiku Oyama. As we investigate the mystery of their deaths, we explore how the past is echoed in the lives of sex workers today. Sex work - stigmatized and romanticized in equal measures throughout history - has always been among the rare industries where women have had the potential to make more money than men, yet they've seldom been able to reap the financial benefits of this disparity because of the physical and moral risks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Katherine McHale Slaughterback - aka Rattlesnake Kate - claimed to have killed over a hundred rattlesnakes outside Greeley, Colorado in a single day in 1925, and then fashioned a flapper dress from their skins. Though she went on to become a legend - a kind of "feminist Paul Bunyan" for Colorado - we'll look at the real life ways she broke down gender roles as a woman in the west. To help tell this story, we talked with Neyla Pekarek, a member of the Colorado band The Lumineers, who recently wrote a folk opera about Rattlesnake Kate.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this time of the #metoo movement, we look back at the so-called "Naropa Poetry Wars" - a sex scandal at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado involving Chogyam Trungpa, the poet Allen Ginsberg's spiritual teacher, and the frenzy of gossip, fingerpointing, and betrayal that divided the community after Trungpa was accused of inapprorpiate sexual behavior. This episode focuses on the experiences of women in the 1970's, how freedom doesn't always mean freedom for everyone, and how poets felt the need to look the other way on Trungpa's sexual misconduct in order to maintain loyalty to the vision of the Institute.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drop City in Southern Colorado, one of the first communal living experiments of the twentieth century, launched the modern hippie commune movement and helped redefine notions of freedom and community for an entire generation. While Drop City failed shortly after its creation, it spawned a new commune that survives to this day -- Libre. Interweaving the stories of these two communes seeking freedom and opportunity in the West with interviews of historians and artists we explore the counterculture movement of the 1960s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1969, a trans woman asked Dr. Stanley Biber in the small Southern Colorado town of Trinidad if he'd be willing to perform sex reassignment / gender confirmation surgery. He kept his first few surgeries secret, out of fear of repercussions from the Catholic Nuns who ran his clinic. But eventually word got out and the community rallied around Biber and his patients. In this episode, we explore how Trinidad eventually became known as "The Sex Change Capital of the World."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How did couples get married and divorced in the Ottoman Empire? Leyla Kayhan Elbirlik discusses marriage and divorce cases in Ottoman Istanbul, focusing on research that she completed by examining the records of Istanbul Bab, Davud Pasha and Ahi Çelebi courts between 1755-1840. While Elbirlik's research shows that women actively use the courts in matters related to marriage, divorce and property, it also reassesses the widespread perceptions about the role of women in the Ottoman family and society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is funded by the NHPRC, not the NEH, but it is a scholarly audio recording tied to the project in year 1.   In March-April 2021, CWRGM partnered with "The Tattooed Historian," John Heckman, to launch a five-part Facebook Live series. This featured CWRGM Director Susannah Ural, Senior Assistant Editor Stephanie Seal Walters, and one field expert each week. We could have created our own podcast, but Heckman had a built-in audience that would drive far more viewers to our inaugural events. We also archived video from our live shows and stripped the audio to create CWRGM's first podcast series. Funded by USM's Dale Center for the Study of War &amp;amp; Society, we reached an incredible audience:  •Engaged over 6,000 viewers over the 5-week series on Facebook Live. This does not include YouTube. The number there is a bit less than 10% of the Facebook number as that channel is still in its infancy.  •Over 500 likes/shares on Instagram and Twitter combined for the events.  •Over 1,500 downloads of the podcast series •Interacted with audience in US, Canada, UK, Australia, with others scattered around the world  You can access all of the material – videos and podcasts at https://cwrgm.org/page/podcast. Between this effort and other public transcription events, we have attracted many volunteer transcribers, some of whom are incredibly talented and dedicated.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Most accounts of the collapse of Richard Nixon's presidency begin with Watergate — the now iconic tale of a bungled break-in and the misbegotten cover-up that followed.  But what led to Watergate?  How — and more puzzlingly, why — did one of the shrewdest, most gifted political figures of his time become embroiled in so manifestly lunatic an enterprise in the first place?  Intrigued by that question, writer/journalist Kurt Andersen takes a deep dive into the vast archives at the Nixon Library and emerges with an answer he wasn't expecting: While Watergate doubtless accelerated Nixon's spectacular fall, it was the Vietnam War that led inexorably to the break-in, and from there to the sinking of his presidency.  For Andersen, who came of age in the Vietnam era, that answer in turn begs another, larger question: How did Richard Nixon, with all his foreign policy savvy, allow himself to get trapped in the same quagmire he had watched engulf his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson? These questions are the central concerns of Nixon at War.  Over the course of seven episodes, Andersen peels back the onion and emerges with a new and deeper understanding of both the man and the war, and of the complex linkage between them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sarah Schneewind holds degrees from Cornell University, Yale University, and Columbia University. She has studied the relations between state and society during the Ming era (1368-1644) in three books. "Community Schools and the State in Ming China" shows change over time in the local implementation of one policy, arguing that the center did not determine the policy's course. "A Tale of Two Melons" traces the way the first Ming emperor, his advisors, and people at the local level interpreted one lucky omen. "Shrines to Living Men in the Ming Political Cosmos" argues that shrines to living officials (??) constituted, among many other things, a legitimate way for commoners to participate in politics under the autocratic, bureaucratic Ming monarchy. Schneewind teaches courses on Chinese, Japanese, and Korean history at UC San Diego. She has been President of the Society for Ming Studies, and runs a website called "The Ming History English Translation Project." She has also developed a digital tool called The Late Imperial Primer Literacy Sieve.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Harvard University Press: Shrines to Living Men in the Ming Political Cosmos places the institution of pre-mortem shrines at the intersection of politics and religion. When a local official left his post, grateful subjects housed an image of him in a temple, requiting his grace: that was the ideal model. By Ming times, the "living shrine" was legal, old, and justified by readings of the classics.  Sarah Schneewind argues that the institution could invite and pressure officials to serve local interests; the policies that had earned a man commemoration were carved into stone beside the shrine. Since everyone recognized that elite men might honor living officials just to further their own careers, pre-mortem shrine rhetoric stressed the role of commoners, who embraced the opportunity by initiating many living shrines. This legitimate, institutionalized political voice for commoners expands a scholarly understanding of "public opinion" in late imperial China, aligning it with the efficacy of deities to create a nascent political conception Schneewind calls the "minor Mandate of Heaven." Her exploration of pre-mortem shrine theory and practice illuminates Ming thought and politics, including the Donglin Party's battle with eunuch dictator Wei Zhongxian and Gu Yanwu's theories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What recourse did you have in Ming China if your very excellent local official was leaving your area and moving on to a new jurisdiction? You could try to block his path, you could wail and tear your hair out – or you could house an image of him in a temple, make offerings before it, and create a ‘living shrine.' In Shrines to Living Men in the Ming Political Cosmos (Harvard University Asia Center, 2018), Sarah Schneewind explores every angle of this practice, covering everything from what living shrines looked like and how many there were, to how they functioned as both expressions of gratitude and (more importantly) ways through which Ming subjects could speak out publicly. Beautifully written and elegantly built, this book not only tells you everything you never knew you wanted to know about living shrines, it makes reading about them a joy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Throughout the period of performance, the podcast team at Healthy Materials Lab conducted research and interviews, and scripted, recorded, and produced seven episodes of Trace Material that culminated in the release of the second season of the podcast. We set out to tell the complex and nuanced social history of plastics in the US by working in the tradition of material culture studies and highlighting humanities themes of feminism, futurism, and consumerism. To accomplish this we spoke to a broad range of guests that included historians, politicians, lawyers, Tupperware saleswomen, and highschool activists. In all, sixteen guests joined us in season two and represented a diversity of age, race, gender and plastics expertise/background that aligns with the ubiquitous story of plastics. As a research and storytelling framework, we chose a specific plastic object to focus on for each episode. In our initial application, the objects we highlighted were: Bakelite, Tupperware, PVC, the microwave oven, the Monsanto House of the Future, and Cellulose.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Challenging and considerably broadening popular and scholarly definitions of American folk music, Folksongs of Another America recovers the diverse, multilingual traditions of immigrant, Native American, rural, and working-class performers in America's Upper Midwest during the 1930s and 1940s. The book extensively documents 187 tunes and songs in more than twenty-five languages, with full original lyrics and English translations, biographical notes on the performers and field workers, and many historic photographs. Spanning ballads, hymns, laments, versified taunts, political anthems, street cries, and recitations, these performances were captured during a tranformative era in American history and culture.  The companion musical tracks and documentary film will be freely available for listening, viewing, or download through a partnership with the University of Wisconsin Libraries' Digital Collections Center.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rhody Radio's primary goal was to provide a virtual programming venue for libraries during COVID restrictions, and absolutely achieved this goal, producing 86 episodes of the podcast during the grant window with a total of 6241 listens. Our goals for the project also included supporting library staff in participating in the project, which we did through the creation of a website with resources for creators and through training by the Rhody Radio team, as well as hosting professional podcaster Kristen Meinzer (and author of So You Want to Start a Podcast), for a workshop on podcast episode show structure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Charisma is a concept we typically use to refer to individuals who fascinate, attract, and captivate us in some way. The word's modern usage, however, obscures its origins in Christian doctrine. In such contexts, charismatic figures were understood to have a kind of divinely ordained authority and spiritual influence. In this podcast episode, Molly Worthen, associate professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, explores the evolution of charisma in the popular consciousness and its role in various historical epochs and movements. From St. Paul to contemporary populist politicians, analyzing the ineffable allure of charisma can help us to understand how power has been produced and wielded in both religious and secular contexts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>War is saturated with objects shaped and carried from battlefields to homes.  Sometimes such objects end up in Museums, but the personal stories of how such objects came to make journeys from Vietnam, for example, to rural Utah often do not. One of the main goals of our project is to disperse basic tools that will allow veterans and members of military families as well as the general public to understand the things brought home from war. The stories featured in this segment are from a 2018 roadshow event hosted by UPR and USU's class "1918 Anglo-American Culture and Society in a World at War," where the community was invited to bring in objects from World War I and to tell their stories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Throughout history, Black voices have been outspoken about the institutional oppression they have faced. From the slave narratives like those of Mary Prince, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Jacobs, white audiences were given a glimpse into the emotional, physical, and psychological horrors of enslavement. Authors like Frances Harper tackled the rebuilding of the Black family in books like Iola Leroy. In the 1920s, the Harlem Renaissance created an entire generation of Black American and Caribbean American authors who gave voice to the new burdens that racist society held for freed Blacks. We also began to see Black female authors speak more openly about the double oppression of gender and race. Ida B Wells-Barnett, was one of the most influential Black journalists of her time, and still today, with her reporting on lynching in the American south. Literature is filled with Black rage, Black pain, but also Black hope for a future in which their descendants will not have to march for the same rights we fight for in the present. Today we are going to talk about verbalizing Black rage, especially that of Black women and Black queer folk, and what we gain today by looking closely at the literary history of the Black revolution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Western literary canon is a subject of discourse. Where does it fit in the modern world? While the works of Shakespeare, Plato, and Jane Austen, among others, are important works that have been the framework of our collective literary heritage, how does that impact those kept traditionally left out of those conversations? Marginalized voices have advocated for reimagining these stories to make them more diverse, expanding the canon to be more inclusive and/or just chucking the idea of a "western canon" in general.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since performance was a thing, crafting adaptations of beloved and epic stories has been a part of storytelling. The highest grossing film of all time, Gone with the Wind is an adaptation and the amount of Jane Austen adaptations could fill a whole textbook (and probably has). Today we are gonna talk about book adaptations. What makes a good one, a bad one, and what impact the big screen has had on the novel itself. Especially when only certain kinds of books get adapted.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Decades before our current debate over critical race theory, the 1968 Kerner Report pointed the finger at structural racism for creating the conditions that had triggered a series of protests in Black communities across the United States in the summer of 1967.   Former Senator Fred Harris is the last surviving member of the Kerner Commission, a group appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the protests and author the report, which shocked the political establishment and the public. Featuring interviews with Fred Harris and rare archival audio, we look back at this pivotal moment in American race relations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the first half of the 20th century, the disease known as poliomyelitis panicked Americans. Just like Covid today, polio stopped ordinary life in its tracks. Tens of thousands were paralyzed when the virus attacked their nervous systems. Many were left unable to walk. In the worst cases, people's breathing muscles stopped working, and they were placed in an iron lung, a giant ventilator that fits the human body from the neck down.  On June 8, 1953, five-year-old Martha Lillard contracted polio. She spent six months in the hospital, where she was put in a ventilator called an iron lung to help her breathe. A polio vaccine became widely available in 1955 — and millions of Americans got vaccinated. The iron lung became obsolete and they stopped being manufactured in the late 1960's. While many people who suffered from polio or post-polio syndrome either weaned themselves off the machines or switched to another form of ventilator, Martha never did. To this day, she is one of only two people in the United States who still depends on the iron lung to survive.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Only one human disease has ever been completely eradicated from the earth: smallpox. Smallpox claimed the lives of ancient Egyptian pharaohs as well as an estimated 300 million people during the twentieth century. Then, by the 1980s, it was gone.  The smallpox vaccine—the world's very first vaccine—was invented by Edward Jenner in the 1700s. Almost two hundred years later, public health workers from around the world came together to try to eliminate the virus. American public health worker Alan Schnur and French doctor Daniel Tarantola were among them. When Schnur and Tarantola arrived in Bangladesh in the early 1970s, it was the last country in the world to still have outbreaks of variola major, the deadliest strain of smallpox. Variola major killed a third of the people it infected. Our story chronicles the last case of deadly smallpox, involving a 2-year-old girl named Rahima Banu and the public health workers who helped stamp out the virus worldwide.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On November 4th, 1961, 28-year-old Ed Dwight got a letter from the United States government inviting him to join the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) at Edwards Air Force base—making him the United States' first Black astronaut candidate. Dwight had been a commander with the Air Force, flew B-52s in Japan, and was a bomber pilot with 9,000 flying hours under his belt, more than many of his white counterparts.  Dwight's selection was met with cover spreads all over black media, from Ebony to Jet Magazine. It also satisfied the public's demands that the U.S. send a Black person to space. However, according to Dwight, his arrival at ARPS was met with disapproval from the largely white instructors—including the head of the school, Air Force Officer Chuck Yeager.  In October 1963, 14 astronaut trainees, known as Group 3, were selected for NASA's next missions: Gemini and Apollo. Though he completed his training, Ed Dwight was not chosen. Our story follows Dwight's career and explores the underlying racial tensions in the United States' space race with the Soviet Union.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>These in-depth, hour-long radio programs tell the story of underground mining and other important chapters in Butte, Montana's history by drawing from archival recordings and new oral histories from independent miners, Anaconda Company men and women, and a diverse cast of characters from mining-adjacent industries and professions within the once-booming city of Butte. This program covers a pivotal moment in the history of Butte, Montana, when pumps servicing the underground mines were turned off, resulting in the flooding of 10,000 miles of underground tunnels. This led to the creation of one of America's largest Superfund sites, the flooded Berkeley Pit.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Episode 1 of this radio series Mining City Reflections features the story of Perdita Duncan while exploring the experience of African Americans through an oral history, recorded in 1980 by Montana historian and professor Mary Murphy. She interviewed Perdita Duncan, an articulate and self-assured voice for those who endured discrimination --- not for their ethnicity or national origin but for the color of their skin. Perdita was born in Butte in 1927, the second of four children in the Duncan family. They were among the Mining City’s small black population that hovered around two thousand, a scant two per cent of the total. While Jim Crow laws did not exist in Montana, African-Americans were not fully accepted in Butte.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>The Verdigris Project's oral history collection preserves the memory of Butte, Montana's bygone neighborhoods, underground mines, and industrial might. Our goal was to preserve these stories for future generations, including the family members of the narrators, but also researchers and historians who might make use of these materials for future projects. The living memory of underground mining in Butte is fading away, but these recordings preserve that memory. We gathered these oral histories to help us remember what Butte once was and better understand how it continues to change. This recording with Frank Palakovich is one of nearly a hundred oral histories captured for the project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Much of what we know about the underground railroad focuses on the network of secret routes and safe houses that moved enslaved people to freedom. But many living in the deep south or along the coast escaped by sea. On The Point, we talk with an historian about the significance of these maritime routes and why they've largely been left out of the historical record. Dr. Timothy Walker, Professor of History at UMASS Dartmouth and editor of the book Sailing to Freedom, Maritime Dimensions of the Underground Railroad is our guest on the program.

		<Abstract>In May 1796, an enslaved woman named Ona Judge fled the presidential household in Philadelphia and escaped to freedom on a ship headed for New Hampshire. Judge's successful flight was one of many such escapes by the sea in the 18th and 19th centuries. Enslaved people boarded ships docked in ports great and small and used coastal water ways and the ocean as highways to freedom. We often learn about the Underground Railroad in school, but what about its aquatic component? On today's episode, Dr. Timothy D. Walker joins Jim Ambuske to discuss his new edited volume, Sailing to Freedom: Maritime Dimensions of the Underground Railroad, which was published by the University of Massachusetts Press in 2021. Walker is a Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, and along with the contributors to Sailing to Freedom, Walker guides us towards new horizons in our quest to better understand this history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this podcast we bring together questions of sound and questions of justice. Debates about justice are one way that people address resource scarcity, violence, and community survival. "Justice" is a broad category that can evoke competing visions; it is mediated by concepts, social structures, and relations. Here we explore how it is mediated by sound, such as the qualities of a voice, authoritative speech, songs of solidarity, or the noise of protests. Distinctions between sounds, such as "voice" and "noise," are in turn mediated by ideologies that connect sound to socio-political dynamics. Soundshapes how people know, experience or engage justice, just as ideas about justice orient people to sound . We ask: how does sound ground or undermine prevailing approaches to 'justice'? How does sound offer novel ways to contest or reimagine what constitutes justice? In short, what does justice sound like?  Reflecting on the mediating relations between sound and justice, this podcast tells the stories of sonic objects. These include: the circulation of an anthem during protests against citizenship laws in India; judges' masculine registers in sexual assault sentencing hearings in Milwaukee, WI; the acoustic dimensions of the ‘field' in the work of human rights and humanitarian aid interpreters; the role of a theme song in addressing strategic dilemmas in marijuana legalization campaigns; and the affective qualities of participants' voices in "successful" restorative justice circles. Drawing on the capacity of the podcast to incorporate sound, we interrogate and interpret the sensory experiences of justice and the communicative practices on which imaginings of justice depend. Our contributors are Will Garriott, Julia Kowalski, Sameena Mulla, Laura Kunreuther, and Katherine Martineau.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Seiji Shirane's Imperial Gateway: Colonial Taiwan and Japan's Expansion in South China and Southeast Asia, 1895-1945 (Cornell UP, 2022) demonstrates that colonial Taiwan was an imperial center in its own right, a political, social, and economic hub for the southern expansion of Japan's empire led by officials with agendas that did not always match those of the government in Tokyo. In addition to this contribution to the study of Japanese empire, Imperial Gateway highlights two aspects of the history that are often underappreciated in the Anglophone literature. First, Shirane expands the aperture of his narrative beyond bilateral Sino-Japanese relations to encompass a dynamic multilateral milieu that includes colonial Taiwan, the region's Western powers, and the Taiwanese subjects of the empire called "overseas Taiwanese" (sekimin) by Japan. Second, Shirane pays particular attention to the agency not just of the Government-General installed by Japan to rule over Taiwan, but also the "overseas Taiwanese" both wooed by the Japanese to advance imperial ambitions and also pursuing their own autonomous interests.  Nathan Hopson is an associate professor of Japanese language and history in the University of Bergen's Department of Foreign Languages.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>EPISODE 17  Episode 17: Sophie White. In this episode, Siobhan talks with Sophie White about her book, Voices of the Enslaved: Love, Labor, and Longing in French Louisiana (University of North Carolina Press, 2019). White is Associate Professor of American Studies and Concurrent Associate Professor in the Departments of Africana Studies, History, and Gender Studies at the University of Notre Dame. In eighteenth-century New Orleans, the legal testimony of some 150 enslaved women and men–like the testimony of free colonists–was meticulously recorded and preserved. Questioned in criminal trials as defendants, victims, and witnesses about attacks, murders, robberies, and escapes, they answered with stories about themselves, stories that rebutted the premise on which slavery was founded. This episode is part of a series featuring legal history works from UNC Press. Support for the production of this series was provided by the Versatile Humanists at Duke program.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Episode 19: Robert Chase. In this episode, Siobhan talks with Robert Chase about his book, We Are Not Slaves: State Violence, Coerced Labor, and Prisoners' Rights in Postwar America (University of North Carolina Press, 2020). Chase is Associate Professor of History at Stony Brook University. In We Are Not Slaves Chase draws from three decades of legal documents compiled by prisoners to narrate the struggle to change prison from within. Told from the vantage point of the prisoners themselves, this book weaves together untold but devastatingly important truths from the histories of labor, civil rights, and politics in the United States as it narrates the transition from prison plantations of the past to the mass incarceration of today. This episode is part of a series featuring legal history works from UNC Press. Support for the production of this series was provided by the Versatile Humanists at Duke program.</Abstract>
