		<Abstract>A project of the William M. Scholl Center for American History and Culture at The Newberry Library in Chicago, the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries is a powerful historical research and reference tool in electronic form. The Atlas presents in maps and text complete data about the creation and all subsequent changes (dated to the day) in the size, shape, and location of every county in the fifty United States and the District of Columbia. It also includes non-county areas, unsuccessful authorizations for new counties, changes in county names and organization, and the temporary attachments of non-county areas and unorganized counties to fully functioning counties. The principal sources for these data are the most authoritative available: the session laws of the colonies, territories, and states that created and changed the counties.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Papers of George Washington Digital Edition (PGWDE) adds volumes from the letterpress edition on a regular basis.  Added in March 2009 were Revolutionary War volumes 15 and 16 and Presidential 13, bringing the total volumes in PGWDE to 55.   Addition includes complete integration of the new material into the table of contents and consolidated index.  In March 2010, PGWDE added six maps from the letterpress edition. (Battle of Trenton, 25-26 Dec. 1776; Battle of Princeton, 3 Jan. 1777; Delaware Campaign, September to November 1777; Battle of Monmouth, 28 June 1778; Lower New York, 1778-1779; Rhode Island, July-August 1778)  Additions to Early Access, pre-release transcriptions of documents, during this period were January 2010 (272 documents) and May 2010 (490 documents).  PGWDE moved in November 2008 to the American Founding Era Platform, which provides a single entry point into all digital publications of The American Founding Era.  During this grant period, PGWDE continued its ongoing effort to create and maintain a consolidated index, standardize all author and recipient names in metadata, update the repository list to conform with MARC standards, enter corrections as discovered, and link cross references.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Oregon Petrarch Open Book" is a scholarly data-base driven hypertext around Francis Petrarch's fourteenth-century poetry collection, the Canzoniere. Using open source software we are building a flexible and comprehensive structure of digital assets that promotes innovative research, preservation and pedagogy based on the international collaboration among scholars and institutions. In the current iteration of OPOB, a scholar is able to read a poem in the original language, examine commentaries, compare a series of different translations, analyze contemporary rewritings, and finally, explore multimedia assets associated with the poem.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Walters' collection of Islamic Manuscripts showcases masterpieces of illuminated and illustrated manuscripts. The sacred, devotional and non-religious manuscripts presented here were created across the breadth of the Islamic world and date from the 9th through the 19th century. In the Islamic book, the primary vehicle for literary and artistic expression, the powers of poetry, prayer and visual form collide. They bear witness to remarkable achievements in literature and the book arts. Examples include a 15th-century Koran from northern India, executed at the height of the Timurid empire; a luxurious 16th-century copy of the Khamsa by Amir Khusraw, illustrated by a number of famous artists for the emperor Akbar; and a Turkish calligraphy album by Sheik Handullah al Amasi, one of the greatest calligraphers.   All images of Islamic manuscripts were created and are provided through a Preservation and Access grant awarded to The Walters Art Museum by the National Endowment for the Humanities, 2008-2010.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Azoria Project Archive is a collection of original documents and publications generated from fieldwork and research of the Azoria Project, an excavation of the Department of Classics and the Research Laboratories of Archaeology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Azoria is an Early Iron Age and Archaic site in eastern Crete, originally explored by Harriet Boyd Hawes for the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 1900. Subsequent work at the site (the Azoria Project) has been conducted annually since 2001, including phases of topographical survey (2001); excavation (2002-2006); site conservation (2003-2008); and study and publication (2007-2012). The documents in this collection comprise an archive of original field notes, excavation notebooks, stratigraphic sections, manuscript drafts, artifact catalogs, and illustrations (plans, drawings, maps, and photographs) produced by this research project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Blake's Small Book of Designs copy A and Large Book of Designs copy A; the republication of Blake's large color printed drawings of 1795, with five additional impressions and all of them now searchable; and the addition to the Blake Collection Lists of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts—31 contributing institutions altogether. The Archive now also features newly revised textual transcriptions for Blake's descriptions of his illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso," as well as updated Help documentation that reflects the launch of the Virtual Lightbox and recent improvements to the Archive's search engines.   The Archive has already published in its Preview Mode a selection of 23 impressions of the large color printed drawings (at least one impression of each) and the small version of Pity printed from a different matrix. With this republication, the Archive adds five impressions of five designs: Newton (Lutheran Church in America), never before reproduced in color, God Judging Adam (Philadelphia Museum of Art), Nebuchadnezzar (Minneapolis Institute of Arts), Satan Exulting over Eve (Tate Collection), and Naomi Entreating Ruth and Orpah to Return to the Land of Moab (Fitzwilliam Museum). The Archive now contains all extant impressions of the twelve designs except the last impression of Hecate, or the Night of Enitharmon's Joy, in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, which declined the Archive's request for a high-resolution image. With this republication, all the impressions of the color printed drawings are searchable and their illustration descriptions accessible, enabling users to engage in detailed, specific, and reliable searches of motifs, objects, subjects, and gestures.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1803, after three increasingly unhappy years in Felpham, Sussex, as artist-in-residence for William Hayley, Blake wrote in a letter to his friend and patron Thomas Butts, "O why was I born with a different face / Why was I not born like the rest of my race" (Erdman pages 733-34). He varied that couplet only slightly in the separate poem "Mary," which at some point he copied neatly into a 22-page manuscript with nine other poems—seven known from no other source—on paper that he reutilized from Hayley's Designs to a Series of Ballads, 1802 (to which Blake had contributed engraved illustrations). On the spacious inside margins he wrote out the ten poems that constitute what is conventionally known as The Pickering Manuscript—after one of its several nineteenth century owners.   The Pickering Manuscript follows An Island in the Moon as the second major project overseen by the Archive team from the University of Rochester's department of English. The manuscripts, like other works in the Archive, have fully searchable texts and images supported by our ImageSizer application; by the Archive's revamped search engines, which allow more productive searching; and by the Virtual Lightbox, our new digital tool that allows users to examine images (including images of texts) side by side, as well as to manipulate them for close study. The manuscripts feature zoomed images of textual cruxes to strengthen the explanatory power of Editors' Notes. A sophisticated XML tagset integrated with a straightforward and legible color coding system (using XSLT and CSS) reduces the clutter of conventional textual signs and symbols. A simple key to the color coding is available from every page of the transcriptions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This copy, prepared in 1806 especially for Thomas Butts, Blake's patron, is in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery. Complete copies of Songs consist of 54 impressions; due to the way Blake assembled Songs copy E, it has 54 impressions, but it is missing "The Clod &amp;amp; the Pebble" and has duplicates of "Laughing Song."  Almost all the impressions were printed from various print runs, with most of the Innocence impressions coming from the raw sienna and yellow-ochre printing of 1789 (see Innocence copy B in the Archive), and its Experience impressions coming from the yellow-ochre impressions that form Experience of Songs copies B, C, and D, printed in 1794 (copies B and C are in the Archive).    Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of Songs copy E are fully searchable and are supported by our Virtual Lightbox and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books, and with the Lightbox, users can examine images from any of the works side by side, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to copy E and to all the Songs texts previously published.</Abstract>

It is the ideal means for studying and comparing Blake's Milton watercolors.

		<Abstract>Our new search engines provide a powerful, streamlined interface for exploring both textual and pictorial elements of Blake's work in the Archive.  In addition to searching transcriptions of Blake's work, users can now search visual motifs, work titles, and editors' notes and detailed illustration descriptions.  Users can also restrict search results by date range, order them by composition or print date, or broaden them by including synonyms and related words from the Archive's new search term thesaurus.  These features make possible precise searches for details in Blake's images.  For example, users can search for figures in specific postures (such as "running" or "arms raised") in designs executed during the 1790s.  It is also possible to search for many motifs simultaneously—for example, all designs with sheep, AND trees, AND a shepherd—or to search for works containing any one of the search terms—for example, all designs with sheep, OR trees, OR a shepherd.  The updated search engines also restore search functionality to the Archive's electronic edition of The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, edited by David V. Erdman.   The Virtual Lightbox is an application that allows users to collect, study, and manipulate images in the Archive. It incorporates all the features of our existing Java applets, Inote and ImageSizer, while adding a number of new capabilities that make it an ideal workspace for research in the Archive.  For example, the Lightbox allows users to examine works in different media side by side; to crop, zoom, and juxtapose images for close study; and to access image information and illustration descriptions from within the Lightbox workspace.  The Archive plans to release the source code of the Virtual Lightbox under the MIT License later this year.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Copy D is in the British Museum and copy G is in the Fitzwilliam Museum.  The Book of Thel is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the netherworld) appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Copies D and G are from the first of three printings of Thel, during which Blake produced at least thirteen copies, printed in five different inks to diversify his stock. Copy D, for example, was printed in yellow ochre ink, copy G in green and greenish-blue inks; both are lightly finished in water colors. Copies from this press run were certainly on hand when Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s." Copies D and G join copies in the Archive from the other two printings: copy F, printed and colored c. 1795, and copy O, printed and colored c. 1818. They also join copies H, J, L, and R from the first printing.   Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of Thel copies D and G are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to copies D and G and to all the Thel texts previously published.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake's water color illustrations to the Bible. All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as "Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824," under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings. This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake's images).   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts. The exceptions are The Whore of Babylon of 1809 and The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation. While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake's illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake's visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake's intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.   The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as Abraham and Isaac, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake's final biblical water colors, such as Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When planning a third edition of his successful school text of Virgil's Pastorals, Robert John Thornton employed Blake to contribute some of the new designs for the two-volume work. His assignment was to illustrate Ambrose Philips' English "imitation" of Virgil's first eclogue. Blake produced four small designs as relief etchings on a single copperplate, but these were rejected by Thornton. There may have been several reasons, including the unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual matrix. Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings. He executed a series of at least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash preliminary drawings; these were probably approved by Thornton. The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however, were far less conventional. Thornton was again taken aback by Blake's bold transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities. Several influential artists, including John Linnell and Sir Thomas Lawrence, commended Blake's work; their opinions convinced Thornton to print them in his 1821 edition. Three designs were engraved by a journeyman for the sake of comparison with Blake's own productions in wood, and Thornton added a statement below Blake's first design implying his hesitations about Blake's artistry. Pre-publication proofs of Blake's wood engravings show that each group of four were cut on a single block; these were cut apart, slightly reduced in size on all four sides, and printed with brief letterpress captions. This format, as published in Thornton's Virgil, is preserved in our reproductions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake's work as both artist and poet. Among his many and complex responses to that text is a group of paintings he created for his patron Thomas Butts, beginning in 1799. Most were executed in that year and the next, but at least three were probably completed while Blake was in Felpham, 1802 and 1803. Fifty-three of these "cabinet paintings" (as small works of this type were called in Blake's time) have been recorded. Only thirty are now traceable, seven based on the Old Testament and the remainder on the New.   This group of nineteen paintings is the second installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake's drawings and paintings illustrating the Bible. The first installment, a group of twenty water colors with subjects based on the Old Testament, was published in March of this year.   The medium of these paintings, now generally called "tempera," is water-based with a glue and/or gum binder. Blake was probably trying to create jewel-like paintings; in his Descriptive Catalogue of 1809, he compared them to "enamels" and "precious stones." He never used the word "tempera" but called his medium "fresco"—a term that recalls Renaissance wall paintings—and claimed that he had invented the new genre of "portable Fresco," an alternative to paintings in oil. Most were executed on canvas, but three are on copper and one (The Agony in the Garden) is on tinned iron.   Unfortunately, Blake's medium was inherently unstable. The pigment layers expanded and contracted at different rates. Almost all his temperas of 1799-1803 show considerable surface cracking and other defects; many have been repaired at least once. Some, such as The Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, have been over-painted in ways that misrepresent Blake's original work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An Island in the Moon (Fitzwilliam Museum) is an incomplete manuscript written in pen and ink in Blake's hand. It notably contains the earliest extant drafts of "Nurse's Song," "HOLY THURSDAY," and "The Little Boy Lost," which make their first published appearance in his Songs of Innocence (1789).   Topical allusions and the history of Blake's associations with the London social circle of the Rev. A. S. Mathew and his wife Harriet in the 1780s suggest a period of composition c. 1784-85. Before the manuscript was given to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905, two or more leaves may have been removed. The contents of a final page of lettering and rough sketches (object 18), apparently unrelated to the text of Island, may reflect Robert Blake's attempts to draw subjects that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William (see Editors' Notes for object 18).   In An Island in the Moon Blake, writing in his mid to late 20s, demonstrates a born satirist's instincts for the ridiculous with a boisterous sendup of middle class London social and intellectual life distilled into eleven brief chapters of "Great confusion &amp;amp; disorder" (object 10). The use of dialogue interspersed with song lyrics links the narrative to both contemporary theatrical forms and broader eighteenth-century satirical traditions. Blake's experiences in the Mathew circle may be the main inspiration for these mocking reflections, which feature impertinent, passionate, confrontational characters, some if not all derived from Blake's contemporaries, probably including Blake himself and his younger brother Robert as Quid and Suction. Although Blake left it orphaned, untitled, and unfinished in a heavily revised manuscript, Island is in some sense a primary literary experiment for him, setting the undertone of much to follow.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Only nine complete copies of the Marriage are known to exist; copies B and E—here reproduced for the first time in their entirety and in color—join copies C, D, F, G, H, and I, previously published in the Archive.   Blake etched twenty-seven plates for the Marriage in relief in 1790. Copy B, one of the first complete copies printed, is essentially monochrome, relying on colored inks rather than water color washes for its coloring. It was produced with copy H in 1790, with plates printed in various shades of reddish brown, yellow ochre, raw umber, olive green, and green on both sides of the leaves. However, the impressions forming copy H (Fitzwilliam Museum) were extensively finished in watercolors and pen and ink, with texts gone over in various colored inks, letter by letter, line by line, presumably when sold in 1821 to Blake's young patron, John Linnell. Copy B, its sister copy, looks nothing like copy H, but provides an excellent idea of what copy H originally looked like.   Copy E is also a sister copy, beautifully and heavily color printed c. 1794 on one side of the leaf with copy F (Morgan Library). It was produced in the style used for Songs of Experience of Songs of Innocence and of Experience copy F and Visions of the Daughters of Albion copy F, both color printed c. 1794 and in the Archive. The plates in copy E were once ordered other than 1-27, as they are now, but this variant plate order is probably not by Blake. The red outlines around eleven images are not by Blake.   Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the texts and images of Marriage copies B and E are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Comprehensive electronic data underlying the "Eastern Han Chinese Dictionary Translation Project" (NEH RQ-50525-10), and arising from Cook's (2003) PhD dissertation, was published for the first time in February, 2011, as part of the bilingual (Chinese-English) Wenlin 4.0 software package. This data, the result of 17 years of work, includes the full reconstructed Shuowen Urtext in three parallel Chinese versions (Seal Script, Traditional, Modern), together with a wide variety of key contextual data needed for collation, proofing, interpretation and translation of the base text (including Chinese and English lexicographic data, and historical phonological and semantic data). The data is presented along with the large specialized fonts created for this project, including complete Unicode 6.0 CJK font support (CDL), linguistic transcription support, and Cook's Duan Yucai Seal font. Wenlin Institute's cutting-edge software serves as the primary platform for the Shuowen translation project, and is also the primary means of publishing project results; the ingenious user-interface streamlines access to the ancient text, and has been customized for enhanced cross-platform digital publication of the Shuowen translation project findings; Wenlin 4.0 runs on current Apple and Windows operating systems (see Wenlin 4.0, Bishop et al., 2011).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This archive is the result of the Documenting Endangered Languages Project "Lachixío Zapotec Conversations: Audio-Visual Archive and Transcription Collection (zpl)" [Oaxaca, Mexico] funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities FN-50065-10.  The NEH funding provided for Mark Sicoli to produce transcriptions of a 40 hour video corpus, enrich and code segments of the data for conversation analysis of basic social actions, and translate the transcribed Zapotec to Spanish and portions of the corpus to English.  Lachixío (including the close dialects of San Vicente, and San Miguel and San Mateo Mixtepec) is the last language of the West Zapotec clade in which speakers are competent conversationalists.  This corpus was produced at a time when the historical trajectory was one of language shift to Spanish monolingualism throughout the region and in which the opportunities to document the language in its natural conversational ecology had grown few.  The videos were recorded during the summers of 2008 and 2009 under funding from the Max Planck Society when Sicoli was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.  The corpus of transcribed videos provides resources that represent the language in everyday cultural settings, such as families receiving visitors, working together on daily chores, eating meals, joking, teasing, socializing children, sharing stories and more.  The materials can both be considered a linguistic "text" collection as well as a representation of Zapotec culture in the Lachixío region of the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca, Mexico through conversational (multimodal) social interaction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Asian Stoneware Jars project, authored by Peter Grave of the University of New England (Australia), is a data publication in Open Context that provides data on the likely provenance and production dynamics of large stone jars, many found in dozens of shipwrecks in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Using a variety of analytical techniques to detect trace elements, Graves and his team identified that the stoneware vessels originated in at least seventeen discrete production zones ranging from southern China to Burma, providing insights on the transport of goods around the globe during the 14th- 17th centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Modern Art Iraq Archive (MAIA) project works to document Iraq's rich but threatened modern artistic heritage. This project prototypes a participatory content-management system to trace, share and enable community enrichment around this art. MAIA houses images of works of art, many of them now lost, from the Iraqi Museum of Modern Art in Baghdad, as well as publications, exhibition catalogs, and personal documentation. MAIA's goals are to raise awareness of the diverse body of modern works of Iraqi art, to help locate their current whereabouts, and to assist agencies working to prevent their illegal movement and sale. MAIA aims to reach a wide and participatory audience across the globe, and offers users the ability to document, discuss, explore, and enrich Iraqi artistic expressions and experiences. Central to its development were ease of use, translation into Arabic, extensive and inclusive documentation, community contribution, and syndication of content elsewhere on the Web.</Abstract>

The focus is on flap books, or turn-up books, the simplest, and earliest types composed of one or two pieces of paper cut and folded. They were published from the mid 17th century until the mid 19th century in England and America. Children also made their own examples. The site has seven links that the user clicks on for them to open. Six are presently active: background, bibliography, play, blog, and image gallery.

		<Abstract>The Syriac Gazetteer is a geographical reference work of Syriaca.org for places relevant to Syriac studies. "Places relevant to Syriac Studies" include places named in Syriac texts (such as ?arqel — ????), places interesting to historians who work on Syriac texts (such as Dura-Europos), and places where scholarship on Syriac is being produced (such as Japan). There are no temporal or spatial boundaries for the geographic database, which collects places relevant to any period of history useful for Syriac studies, from places mentioned in the Peshitta version of Genesis to places founded recently, and from ancient Edessa to Mongol-era outposts in China and diaspora communities in the United States of America. At least in theory, any type or size of place could be represented in the geographic database, from large empires to single churches or a particular named city gate. Maps are provided for places whose location is known, but the database includes places which are not located or even locatable: each place is a conceptual thing with a mental existence related to, but not reducible to, its physical manifestation. Mythological and other ahistorical places are also included in the database.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The American Board's Near East Mission (Turkey) maintained a set of personnel files at its regional office in Istanbul, for Board employees who worked in Turkey and its surroundings. One component of this collection is a series of more than 1,800 index cards that provide basic information about each individual, such as birth and death dates, educational and employment history, and dates and places of work assignments. The card file includes both missionaries and contract workers who served the Board in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, starting with Revs. Levi Parsons and Pliny Fisk, the Board's first appointees sent to the Middle East in 1819.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1935, the Near East Mission of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions undertook preparation of a memorial book to commemorate and honor those who had served the Board in Turkey, the Middle East, and the Balkans from the early 1800s through the early twentieth century. The initial three-volume work was compiled and edited by Charles Trowbridge Riggs, Near East Mission Secretary from 1910 to 1938, and contained biographical sketches of more than six hundred missionaries. Subsequent to Mr. Riggs' death in 1953, a fourth volume was prepared to include those members of the Mission who died prior to 1970 but were not included in the earlier volumes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Florida Museum of Natural History's Website Database for the Maya archaeological collection from Cerro Maya (Cerros) allows researchers to search by various categories including provenience, special context (burial or cache), structure number, kind of artifact and chronology. The digitized catalogues include 10 field logs that include over 18,500 individual artifact entries, and materials catalogues drawn from the general catalogues, but organized by the type of materials: bone, botanical, ceramics and clay, chipped and ground stone, polished stone, shell, plaster, modern artifacts, and miscellaneous catalogues. The website has digitized database files of over 200,000 artifacts and photographs of small finds (objects catalogued individually rather than in lots) and sherds representing a total number of 108 ceramic types from the site. In addition, a gallery of 3D images  includes examples of ceramics, polished stone, modified bone, and metalwork that can be rotated using a cursor, mouse, or touch screen.   The website also offers links to documents relating to Cerro Maya: a ceramic type list, a structure and excavation correlation, a small finds catalogue, a bibliography related to Cerro Maya, a table of ceramic phases and maps of the site.. &amp;#x0D; .</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thanks to the funding of the NEH, I am in the process of creating an open-access website which provides a portal for scholars of pre-modern collective communal histories to publish their raw prosopographical data, whether in the form of population databases or family trees. Such an endeavor will allow other researchers to not only better engage the monographs or journal articles relying on the corresponding information but also observe additional historical trends beyond original investigator's purview. Furthermore, such data could be used as an educational tool for students whose linguistic limitations or lack of documentary access had previously prevented them from conducting cultural analyses on historical populations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The data presented here represents partial information about the U.S. State Department's Cultural Presentations Program from 1954-1980. These data were collected during the research for Music In America's Cold War Diplomacy. The two major archival repositories represented in this database are these:&amp;#x0D; • National Archives at College Park, Maryland. Records are principally located in Record Group 59 (General Records of the Department of State).&amp;#x0D; • ARK: University of Arkansas Libraries, Department of Special Collections, Fayetteville, Arkansas. MC468, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Historical Collection. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This database represents a first attempt to organize the extant data about the State Department's Cultural Presentations program, which began in 1954. The database is far from complete for the following reasons:&amp;#x0D; * The U.S. government keeps only a tiny fraction (about 5%) of the records it generates. Most of the extant archival records of cultural presentations tours are incomplete; some tours are not documented at all in existing State Department records. There are fewer records for tours in the early-to-mid 1960s than for tours in the 1950s.&amp;#x0D; * I have not had the resources to survey all the extant records. My primary focus was on the time period between 1954 and the early 1970s; later tours are poorly represented in the data collected here.&amp;#x0D; * Performers' itineraries were subject to change. Local circumstances often forced significant alterations to the plan for each tour. Revised itineraries may not have been generated or preserved.&amp;#x0D; * Many documents about cultural diplomacy have not yet been collected from personal collections and the archives of groups that traveled.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The database should therefore be used as a starting point only. Nonetheless, it offers scholars and other interested persons a way to find out who went where on State Department-funded musical tours.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection of essays emerged from the research projects that 24 NEH Scholars developed during the NEH Summer Institute "Leonardo da Vinci: Between Art and Science" (Florence, Italy, June-July 2012), hosted bythe Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz (KHI).&amp;#x0D; Over a period of three weeks, NEH Scholars explored the relations between art and science in the works of Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), the versatile, canonical artist of western art who moved with equal ease among artistic, literary, intellectual and scientific circles.&amp;#x0D; The Institute was organized around three major themes:&amp;#x0D; ¦ Word and Image&amp;#x0D; ¦ Painting and Drawing&amp;#x0D; ¦ Craftsmen and Scholars&amp;#x0D; Selected to address cogent issues in the study of Leonardo's works and writings, these three themes are more generally significant to understand the relations between art and science in the early modern period.&amp;#x0D; Within these three themes, NEH Scholars developed their individual research projects and the essays gathered here are the first outcomes of those projects.&amp;#x0D; The essays vary greatly in themes and approaches, reflecting the diverse background, training and interests of their authors. They all provide unique points of entry into the many aspects of Leonardo da Vinci's works and writings and suggest possible use of new materials for undergraduate teaching and scholarly research.&amp;#x0D; This website includes also additional bibliographical resources and the program of the NEH Institute.</Abstract>

It includes correspond- ence between Michael Anagnos, the Director of Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind (now Perkins School for the Blind) in Boston, and Helen's parents, Capt. A.H. and Kate Keller, as well as with Helen herself. A large part of the correspond- ence is between Anagnos and Annie Sullivan, a graduate of Perkins, who was sent to Tuscumbia, Alabama to work with Helen. The letters feature detailed descriptions of Helen's education, documenting both her rapid progress and some of the challenges that she and her teacher faced.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>PhiloBiblon is the corpus of data catalogued by the PhiloBiblon Project: the romance vernacular sources of medieval and early modern Iberian culture. It is also the bio-bibliographical database management system designed to catalog the primary sources themselves, both manuscript and printed, the texts they contain, the individuals involved with the production and transmission of those sources and texts, and the libraries holding them, along with relevant secondary references and authority files for persons, places, and institutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since planning began in 1985, the Perseus Digital Library Project has explored what happens when libraries move online. Two decades later, as new forms of publication emerge and millions of books become digital, this question is more pressing than ever. Perseus is a practical experiment in which we explore possibilities and challenges of digital collections in a networked world. For the mission of Perseus and its current research, see here.  Perseus maintains a web site that showcases collections and services developed as a part of our research efforts over the years. The code for the digital library system and many of the collections that we have developed are now available. For more information, please go here.  Our flagship collection, under development since 1987, covers the history, literature and culture of the Greco-Roman world. We are applying what we have learned from Classics to other subjects within the humanities and beyond. We have studied many problems over the past two decades, but our current research centers on personalization: organizing what you see to meet your needs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Planning Atlanta: A New City in the Making, 1930s – 1990s is a digital collection of material related to city planning and urban development in Atlanta. The collection consists of city planning maps, city planning publications, demographic data, photographs depicting planning activities, oral histories, and aerial photographs. Much of the Planning Atlanta material was created by the City of Atlanta, the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC), and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Additionally, items from other agencies and entities, such as the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), are included.   Planning Atlanta is a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) funded project and seeks to move beyond the traditional digital library model of simply providing digital equivalents of tangible objects. This city planning focused collection provides free and open access to digitally transformed, dynamic, and engaging content with the goal of enhancing this material for educational and research uses. Many items in the collection have been transformed into digital objects that can be engaged with and manipulated.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Amith has deposited all material developed as part of his documentation and ethnobotanical research in several Nahuat-speaking communities. Relevant to this project is a database (and plant labels generated from this database) of all ethnobotanical material collected in the Sierra Nororiental. Included also are 579 digital recordings and transcription directly about plants named, classified, and used by Nahuat speakers in the region. Also included are 80 recordings about medicinal plants and 104 files about animals (particularly arthropods). Eventually all this material will be also be accessible through the digital portal that this project is funding though this initial grant will only build a prototype with varied example materials.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Serai is a collaborative project, bringing together a development team at the University of Toronto with collaborators at the universities of Nebraska Lincoln, Maryland, and elsewhere. It originated in two distinct initiatives:&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; ePorte, a collaboratory for Premodern Mediterranean Studies, began at the University of Toronto in 2009. It involved from its inception several doctoral students in the Department of History (specialists in cross-confessional interactions in medieval and early modern Iberia, the Italian Peninsula, and the Ottoman Empire), information technologists, digital librarians, and work-study undergraduate students in History and Computer Science, and was coordinated by Prof. Natalie Rothman.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Serai/Early Modern Exchange, a site dedicated to early modern European encounters with Islamicate societies, emerged out of a NEH seminar at the University of Maryland in 2010. The original NEH seminar, "Remapping the Renaissance: Exchange between Early Modern Islam and Europe," was conceived by Judith Tucker (History, Georgetown University), Adele Seeff (Renaissance Studies, University of Maryland), and Karen Nelson (English, University of Maryland). Participants included scholars from History, Religious Studies, Art History, and Languages and Literatures. One of these, Julia Schleck, forged connections with Jyotsna Singh and developed an affiliated program, Serai.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>Serai is a free and open online collaboratory for scholarship on premodern encounters across ethnolinguistic and religious divides.&amp;#x0D;
&amp;#x0D;
Our site is a digital meeting place where scholars can share resources, exchange ideas, and collaborate on projects. It is in an explicitly trans-disciplinary space for researchers, teachers, and students at all stages of their careers. We combine regional expertise with a keen interest in the transformative potential of digital scholarship.&amp;#x0D;
&amp;#x0D;
We hope to inspire others to join us in thinking through our diverse research materials about the multiple intersections between the past and the future of cultural encounters, knowledge production, and boundary crossing, and the urgency of exploring connectivities and confluences across seemingly disparate spaces.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>This is the collection of Bebeli language and its related languages. It includes audio and video recordings, photographs, and written texts of narratives, public events, and conversations as well as elicited linguistic data. It gives special attention to recording traditional cultural knowledge, because the oral chain of transmission of this kind of knowledge is currently being lost.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Audio data is digitally recorded with voice-recorders (Zoom H5 or Zoom H4n). Sound recordings will be in 48 KHz 24 bits and archived as WAV files. A shotgun microphone was used (Zoom SGH-6). Also, the texts are video recorded with a handy cam (Canon EOS REBEL SL1). OLAC compliant metadata was collected for every item. &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Terminology can be more confusing than enlightening, if it is unclear how a term is used. In Egyptology this is certainly the case, because Egyptian architectural terminology is different from that used in other historical architectural regions, such as in Classical architecture. Making use and expanding upon the architectural drawings and photographs of the AEGARON project, AEGARON-IST provides a well-thought out and vetted architectural terminology in three languages (English, German and Arabic). Each term is illustrated by actual examples, rather than idealized construction drawings. The database links to the Getty Thesaurus of Art and Architecture and has a built in hierarchical organization and definition of relationships.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our digital edition of Mary Emerson's Almanacks is being published in phases. The edition adheres to editorial reporting standards established by the Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions and is conformant with TEI Guidelines for XML encoding. A foundational text in Women Writers Online—representing the collection's first manuscript series—The Almanacks of Mary Moody Emerson complements the works of other women writers in the database, which reaches an international audience of scholars, students, and the general public at nearly 220 subscribing institutions, with free research access to the source data granted on request. Emerson's Almanacks contribute significantly to women's intellectual history; document the extent to which early American women embraced transatlantic culture; and evidence the ways in which Emerson anticipates signal aspects of Transcendentalism, the antebellum movement for which her nephew is considered the primary spokesman. Our edition demonstrates that in adopting self-development as a conduct of life, Emerson serves as one of the earliest illustrations of an emerging critical reconsideration of Transcendentalism, envisaged through women. Highlighting the manuscripts' material culture, the edition demonstrates Emerson's ongoing engagement in manuscript circulation, generic experimentation, social authorship, and self-cultivation, attributes that anticipate the similar but more radical experiments of Emily Dickinson; it also provides specific examples of the modes of intellectual transmission between Mary and Waldo Emerson.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>"Women Writers Online is a full-text collection of early women’s writing in English, published by the Women Writers Project at Northeastern University. It includes full transcriptions of texts published between 1526 and 1850, focusing on materials that are rare or inaccessible. The range of genres and topics covered makes it a truly remarkable resource for teaching and research, providing an unparalleled view of women’s literate culture in the early modern period."</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<SecondaryURLDescription>"Since 2007 the Women Writers Project has been collaborating with the editors of The Almanacks of Mary Moody Emerson: A Scholarly Digital Edition, Noelle A. Baker and Sandra Harbert Petrulionis, on an experimental electronic edition of the Almanacks. Because of the length and complexity of these manuscripts, it offers a challenging test case for the WWP as we think through issues of display, reading practice, the representation of documentary materiality, and the development of editorial practice for manuscripts to be published within WWO. As a first step in these experiments, we have created a prototype display of a few Almanack folders, available below, to explore and demonstrate some of the features we envision.

		<Abstract>The Spenser Project Digital Archive is the online companion to the Collected Works of Edmund Spenser, forthcoming from Oxford University Press. At present, readers have access here to full-text versions of the books in which Spenser's work appeared between 1569 and 1590: A Theatre for Voluptuous Worldlings, The Shepheardes Calender, the Spenser-Harvey Letters, and The First Part of The Faerie Queene (books I-III), as well as facsimiles of those books. We also provide scans of all pages containing variant states, an analysis of various forme-states within editions of these texts, and, in the case of The Shepheardes Calender, a grid of variants across the early editions through 1611.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Behind the scenes, we are constructing an even richer archive, which will supplement the forthcoming Oxford Edition of the Collected Works of Edmund Spenser—and so increase the usefulness of that edition. Transcriptions of all of Spenser's works will soon be made publicly available, and edited versions of those texts will follow shortly. Glossaries, commentary, textual and critical introductions, will be available here as soon as they are completed and approved for public release by OUP.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Andrew Coulson initially designed the Oplontis Project database in 2009 and has refined it as we continue to build data for both Villa A and Oplontis B. It consists of a rich user interface provided by a Java web application and leverages MySQL relational database as the metadata information store. Both the web application and the database are currently hosted on an Amazon Web Services server instance. The web application stores photographs and documents uploaded by Project members in a permanent iRODS collection hosted on the Corral storage system at the Texas Advanced Computer Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The entire set of metadata is periodically exported from the database to the XML and is also stored in the iRODS collection.</Abstract>

In-development, the site is a part of the project Educating Harlem: Histories of Learning and Schooling in an American community. &amp;#x0D; It offers published and unpublished archival documents and oral histories, alongside interpretive exhibits. The first phase of the collection includes a group of digitized material that emphasizes the experiences and work of students in Harlem schools in the 1960s and 1970s. Later additions will expand on this theme, and explore materials from and about Harlem teachers and community members as well as students.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The second digital product will be the "Stanford University Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Digital Archive" (the "Archive.")  We are designing this as the world's leading and enduring resource for future generations of historians and the general public.  It will be hosted by Stanford University Libraries in perpetuity. The Archive is the achievement of our Stanford research administrative team, and our goal is to open the archive, attract a worldwide audience, and guide users through search and discovery.  Visitors to the Archive will be welcomed with two leading-edge digital features:&amp;#x0D; A)Digital "Exhibits."  We will build digital "exhibits" through the Stanford Digital Repository "Spotlight" portal.  Each digital "exhibit" will illuminate a small selection of items from our archive with short one thousand-word explanatory essays.  The selections and the essays in exhibit format have been shown to attract new audiences.  Visitors will in this way take a guided "tour" of the Archive, and gain insight and appreciation in a short amount of time.  Our team will curate the "exhibits."  The digital format also gives us the chance to offer "guest curatorships" to professional scholars, teachers, and possibly amateur historians for an expanding series of digital exhibits using our open Archive.  &amp;#x0D; B)Digital "Visualizations."  We will build visual representations to serve as the interactive interface for scholars to use the Archive.  For advanced scholars and general audiences alike, the visualizations will illuminate meanings and patterns in our unprecedented treasury of sources.  Prototypes have been developed to indicate the sites along the rail route for which we have richest collected sources; other visualizations highlight where we need more discovery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This publication offers a dynamic edition of works by Ælfric of Eynsham, the most erudite and prolific author writing in English before Chaucer. Focusing on arguably his most influential work, the Catholic Homilies, it examines the only homilies for which witnesses to all six stages of authorial revision survive, tracing their development through Ælfric's lifetime and nearly 200 years of transmission thereafter. Where printed editions are hard put to capture such a fluid developmental process, the Digital Ælfric allows one visually to trace each step along the way. Annotated transcripts by 43 contributors of all 118 extant copies may be viewed alongside each other or compared directly with digital images of all relevant manuscript pages. Accompanied by scholarly introductions to the project and to Ælfric's life and work, the Digital Ælfric seeks to open new avenues for scholarly exploration and to promote a heightened appreciation for this vital figure in English literature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The newest volume to be added the the Adams Papers Digital Editions, Adams Family Correspondence, volume 10, published in letterpress in 2011 by the Belknap Press, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. The volume covers the period from January 1794 through June 1795, offers over 300 letters from the irrepressible Adamses, including many between John and Abigail never before printed. As always, the Adams family serve as important observers of and commentators on national and international events, from America's growing tensions with Britain and France, to its internal struggles with increasingly virulent political factionalism and the Whiskey Rebellion. The most significant event of the period for the Adamses themselves was John Quincy's appointment as U.S. minister resident at The Hague, the beginning of his long and storied diplomatic career. Accompanying him overseas was his brother Thomas Boylston, the only Adams child who had not yet seen Europe.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica (BHSE) is a guide to 1,837 Syriac stories, hymns, and homilies on Christian saints. These texts blossomed alongside the cult of the saints in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. While traditions in Greek and Latin are well known to scholars, the stories of the saints of the Middle East are only just being discovered. The BHSE makes Syriac hagiography available to scholars and the wider public, with information about these texts including: authors, opening and closing lines, manuscripts, translations, and bibliography. The BHSE is the result of a partnership between Syriaca.org and the Jesuit scholarly society, La société des Bollandistes. The BHSE combines digital scholarship with the methods for the study of hagiography developed by the Bollandists since 1643.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Qadishe (from the Syriac word meaning "saints") is a scholarly catalogue of 1,094 persons venerated in the Syriac Christian traditions. Qadishe includes entries for saints native to the Syriac-speaking milieu as well as for biblical figures and saints from other linguistic or cultural traditions who were appropriated into Syriac religious memory. Individual descriptions of each saint include name variants (in Syriac as well as translation), biographical information such as death dates and related persons, and bibliographies of primary and secondary literature including accounts of the saint's life. For places and texts associated with a saint, Qadishe provides references to related information in The Syriac Gazetteer and the Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Qadishe is freely available online as the first volume of The Syriac Biographical Dicationary.

		<Abstract>A Guide to Syriac Authors is a scholarly manual with entries on nearly 1,000 authors who wrote in Syriac or otherwise had an influence on Syriac literature. A dialect of Aramaic, Syriac flourished as a lingua franca of the Middle East in antiquity and the Middle Ages. Today more than 20,000 manuscripts preserve texts in Syriac pertaining to theology, philosophy, commerce, science, and medicine. As a digital reference work, A Guide to Syriac Authors employs linked data technology to meet the needs of manuscript cataloguers and historical researchers interested in Syriac authors. Relationships between authors and texts, places, or other persons are documented through links to related information in The Syriac Gazetteer and The New Handbook of Syriac Literature.&amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D; A Guide to Syriac Authors is freely available online as the second volume of The Syriac Biographical Dictionary.

Corrected, expanded, compiled and published by Wenlin Institute, Inc. SPC. Based on the ABC Chinese Dictionary Series print edition: An Alphabetical Index to the Hanyu Da Cidian by Victor H. Mair. The Wenlin ABC HDC software edition merges Wenlin's electronic version of the Unabridged HDC Index together with the electronic ABC Chinese-English Dictionary, so that their combined information (568,000 entries) is available in a friendly, intuitive and powerful interface. Ideal for students and specialists investigating Chinese literature.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Hanyu Da Cidian (Unabridged Dictionary of Sinitic) (HDC) is the first large-scale comprehensive word dictionary in Chinese history to include both ancient and modern language. HDC is an excellent reference, but it is difficult to find items in it because they are arranged by radicals and residual strokes — hence the need for an alphabetical index of words. The Wenlin ABC HDC software edition provides easy access to the more than 350,000 multisyllabic entries found in HDC. (An alphabetical index of monosyllabic entries is already available.) It uses Hanyu Pinyin to provide phonetic annotation for the character entries, which enables the user to locate them alphabetically.

		<Abstract>The Civil War Governors of Kentucky Digital Documentary Edition is a freely-accessible online collection of historical documents associated with the chief executives of the state, 1860-1865. Civil War Governors is about far more than the five governors, though. The project records the diverse and largely unknown lives of tens of thousands of Kentuckians, and opens new windows onto the local and personal Civil War stories that have been overlooked. This site, Early Access, is the first public glimpse into the Civil War Governors world.</Abstract>

In Citizenship Under Siege, a project organized by AAC&amp;amp;U and The Democracy Commitment with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, seven community colleges used the humanities to explore this topic. Featuring the efforts of project participants and educators engaged in similar work, this issue of Diversity &amp;amp; Democracy illustrates the potential of the humanities to illuminate issues of identity and belonging.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The multimedia elements of this site reflect the range of ways that Finch's work engaged her contemporary readers and listeners, who knew her work in manuscript, print, or performance, or in all of these forms. Annotations to the featured poems provide analysis and contexts that expose Finch's engagement with her cultural, political and social contexts.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Writing in an era known for the overtly public and political poetry of Dryden, Swift, and Pope, Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea (1661-1720), articulated a different literary and political authority. From her position as a female aristocrat, once at the center of the court and then for many years a political internal exile, Finch explored the individual's spiritual condition as inextricable from social and political phenomena.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This study uses historical records from 36 archives in the United States to analyze 8,437 enslaved people's sale and/or appraisal prices from 1797 to 1865. Demographic information, including name, year, age/age group, gender, state, and trade/skill notations were recorded when applicable. By calculating average appraisal and sale values across cross-sections of gender (male or female) and age group (0-10 years old, 11-22 years old, 23-39 years old, and 40+ years old), a total of sixteen major comparative prices were analyzed (app/male/0-10; app/female/0-10; sale/male/0-10; sale/female/0-10; app/male/11-22; app/female/11-22; sale/male/11-22; sale/female/11-22; app/male/23-39; app/female/23-39; sale/male/23-39; sale/female/23-39; app/male/40+; app/female/40+; sale/male/40+; sale/female/40+).  Scholars have the opportunity to use this data set to understand how enslaved people were valued and appraised. The demographic data included will be useful to those who want to explore various aspects of the history of slavery and enslaved people.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Some 358 surveys were distributed (on excel list linked). Of these, 59 were completed and returned (See Excel list). This effort was followed up with phone and email contacts to 36 institutions. Of the final list of 36 organizations reporting fully, we invited 18 (See Excel list) to come to Houston for a full-day conference; of these 8 attended and participated in the conference (See Excel list).  The final "Guide" that we published online and are promoting includes the full report of holdings of the institutions, the types of institutions and their needs; in these, there was a considerable amount of Hispanic archival materials identified, so as to justify the need for this project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is an early manuscript of the old corpus of Aristotle works. We had to transcribe parts of it in order to determine whether it was a source for Richard Rufus.  As it turns out, despite the early age of the manuscript, these glosses depend on Richard Rufus and Adam Buckfield rather than the reverse.  We publish our transcription here for the use of other scholars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is one of the two most influential early De anima commentaries and the first to draw on Richard Rufus' commentary. It not only records Rufus' influence but in the case of difficult passages allows us to improve the text we publish.  This work was made available to us by special permission from Helen Powell who published excerpts in her Oxford thesis.  Since Miss Powell has since died, her thesis is virtually unavailable now. So we publish this research tool on our website, based on more manuscripts than were available to Powell for the use of other scholars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our main goal in creating this collection is to document children's comprehension and production of Quechua (quz, quh) in rural highland Bolivia and Peru, where a continuum of permeation from Spanish can be observed. The secondary goal is to document variation within Cuzco-Collao Quechua, giving special attention to the variety of Quechua spoken in rural Chuquisaca in South Bolivia. An understanding of rural Bolivian variants is essential for producing school materials for South Bolivian children and for preserving an understanding of their cultural heritage.  Among the scant documentation of the variety spoken in Chuquisaca is a sizeable vocabulary to be included in a dictionary of Bolivian Quechua in preparation by Dr. Pedro Plaza Martínez, and a pedagogical grammar by Louise Stark, Manuel Segovia Bayo and Felicia Segovia Polo (1971). Variation in Cuzco-Collao affix order and interpretation is also detailed by Simon Van de Kerke in his doctoral dissertation (1996) including a morphosyntactic study of the Quechua spoken in the town of Tarata, in close proximity to the highly relexified Cochabamba dialect. Our goal is to study rural and less relexified varieties.  According to a Peruvian Census (2007:2.4.1) declaration of Quechua as the language learned in childhood declined 3.3 percent between 1993-2007. Anecdotal evidence indicates a similar trend in Bolivia. Clearly, the rapid loss of a major indigenous language spoken in childhood represents a threat to the vitality of indigenous cultural transmission in the region as well as a major setback for humankind's understanding of child first and second anguage acquisition, bilingualism and language contact. Despite the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of speakers of Cuzco-Collao Quechua, only a handful of published studies of Andean children's grammar focus on their L1 grammar, and virtually all of these focus on Peruvian children, leaving a serious gap in documentation of indigenous children's language.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Work continues on Volume 14 of the Correspondence of James K. Polk, which will complete the series. In the meantime, as we prepare that volume's annotation and letter summaries, we see no reason not to share the transcriptions. Here you can read 104 letters that Polk wrote and 260 that he received between April 1, 1848, and his death on June 15, 1849. They contain few notes, chiefly describing the texts, identifying enclosures, and citing other Polk letters referenced. But they are accurate, carefully proofread reproductions of the primary documents.  The letters on this site help to illuminate the aftermath of the Mexican War, including Polk's unsuccessful effort to establish territorial governments for the lands acquired from Mexico; the election of Polk's successor, in which Whig and Mexican War general Zachary Taylor defeated Democrat and Polk friend Lewis Cass; and renewed concern over Polk's having misled senators in 1845 about his intentions regarding Texas annexation. They discuss the heated debate over slavery in the United States, the spreading revolutionary activity in Europe, and American interest in purchasing Cuba. Correspondents include California gold seekers, India's poet laureate, and the wives of John Quincy Adams and Robert E. Lee. Polk exchanged personal letters with friends and relatives including three of his siblings; his nephew and ward; and his wife, Sarah Childress Polk. Letters from the last months of his presidency and from his brief retirement address the final illness and the anticipated legacy of one of the most consequential presidents in U.S. history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Indianapolis Imam Warith Deen Muhammad Community collection documents the life of an African American Muslim community that has been part of Indianapolis since the 1950s. Established as "Muhammad's Mosque" on Indiana Avenue, the community was first aligned with the teachings of Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad and then after 1975, with Elijah Muhammad's son and heir, Warith Deen Muhammad, better known as W. Deen Mohammed. Now called the Nur Allah (Light of God) Islamic Center, this congregation has become known in central Indiana for its commitment to civic engagement and interfaith activities. The collection documents its members' involvement in public life while also shedding light on the congregation's religious activities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The collection of 338 items is a series in the Mass. Memories Road Show (MMRS) collection. MMRS is a statewide, event-based participatory archiving program that documents people, places, and events in Massachusetts history through family photographs and stories. Archivists and public historians at the Joseph P. Healey Library at UMass Boston collaborate with local planning teams and volunteers to organize free public events where individuals bring photographs to be copied and included in a digital archive. Contributors are invited to describe the photographs in their own words. In addition, they may choose to share "the story behind the photos" on video, have their own "keepsake photo" taken, receive advice from professional archivists and historians on caring for their family photos, and learn from one another about the history of their community.  The "Show 'Em Whatcha Got" Mass. Memories Road Show: The Hip-Hop Edition collection includes nearly 300 images features informal snapshots and promotional publicity photographs documenting the experiences of artists and producers involved in the four elements of hip-hop–rap, DJs, dance, and graffiti–in the Boston community from the 1980s to the present. Forty-two video interviews with members of Boston's hip-hop community are also featured in the collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Banjo Project is a digital museum and archive that honors the banjo as America's quintessential instrument, and the roles the banjo has played in the lives of Americans from its African roots to present day modern artists and bands. Brought to America by enslaved Africans, the banjo is an important product of three centuries of cultural exchanges, appropriations and face-to-face interactions, traveling between the margins and the mainstream, and its history should not be forgotten.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The attached PDF on the Supplementary Products page was converted from an Excel file version of the Access database draft, which includes all examination information for 52 daguerreotypes identified during the Robert Cornelius Daguerreotype Project. Information on the first object is still incomplete. The remaining 51 objects in the database are entered in their entirety, although all the information does not appear to have been retained in the conversion process. Links to photography are not active. As described in the report, the Library of Congress anticipates publishing the complete Access database, including active photography links, as a downloadable zip file in June 2020. The Lens Media Lab at the Yale Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Material anticipates providing a secondary link to all the information following initial publication by the Library of Congress.</Abstract>
		<AccessModel>Upon publication by LOC in 2020, it is anticipated the database will be open access, with some privacy restrictions applied to targeted images at the request of private owners.</AccessModel>

		<Abstract>This archive is not yet available, since its materials are meant to be shared through a 3DOME project website, and coordinated with a traditional print publication about the Hera temple project. It comprises digitized records compiled from several archive sources in Athens and Germany pertaining to the excavations of the temple in the 1870s and the subsequent interventions at the site through the modern era. These include more than 130 plans and other kinds of illustrations of the architecture and associated objects, 230 historical photographs, 53 notebooks and other unpublished documents kept by previous scholars who worked on the site, and excerpts from 32 digitized publications. Additional discussion of these resources is found elsewhere in the proposal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Harry Adams, also known as "One Shot Harry," was one of the best-known members of the Los Angeles African American community. Having access to the city's inner circle, he became known for his images of politicians, entertainers, and society figures. Adams worked as a freelancer for the California Eagle and Los Angeles Sentinel for 35 years and had a number of churches and lawyers as clients. His collection is particularly rich in its documentation of African American social life including images of social organizations, churches, schools, civil rights organizations, protests and cultural events.  Born in Arkansas in 1918, Adams became interested in photography when he was 12 years old. His photographic career began after he completed a tour of duty in World War II and graduated from the California School of Photography and Graphic Design (operated by Los Angeles photographer Charles Williams).  The collection of images for the period 1950–1985 is rich in its depiction of the unique lives of African Americans in and around the Los Angeles area. There are many images of important black political leaders, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Malcolm X, and many others. Also included are images of Coretta Scott King, Rev. Maurice Dawkins; Mayor Tom Bradley; Jackie Robinson; Rev. H. H. Brookins, Congresswoman and County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke (the first African American woman to represent the West Coast in Congress); Leon and Ruth Washington (founders of the Los Angeles Sentinel); Jessie Jackson; Julian Bond; Cassius Clay; Dr. H. Claude Hudson (founder of the NAACP); civil rights attorney and California Superior Court Justice Loren Miller; and many musicians and entertainers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Guy Crowder chronicled political, social and athletic events in Los Angeles for over 25 years. After graduating from high school in Compton, he enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve, serving from 1957-1963. It was during his military years that he developed his interest in photography from a hobby to a career. His professional career began in 1960 as a staff photographer for Your Community Studio in Los Angeles. He took classes at Harbor College and L. A. Trade Technical College.  Crowder worked as a freelance photographer for the Los Angeles Sentinel, LA Metropolitan Gazette, Los Angeles Times, Ebony and Jet Magazines, Herald Examiner, Southwest Wave, Tempo News,and the West Coast News. This gave him the privilege of a close proximity to the heartbeat of his community. In 1974, Los Angeles Supervisor Kenneth Hahn asked Crowder to work for him, making Crowder the first African American to be employed by the Board of Supervisors.  Crowder maintained his own studio and employed as many as three photographers in his shop. Crowder, or one of his photographers routinely worked seven days a week on assignments.  The Guy Crowder collection consists of photographs of black politicians, athletes, and celebrities and includes images of nearly every African American of any importance who passed through Los Angeles and Las Vegas during his career. Highlights include coverage of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) shootout, the police attack on the Black Panthers, the 1965 Watts riots, Mayor Tom Bradley's campaigns and swearing-in ceremonies, ongoing coverage of the Jackson Five and Michael Jackson, the NAACP, and 100 Black Men, Brotherhood Crusade, the Los Angeles Urban League, Julian Bond, Johnnie Cochran, Jamaal Wilkes, Magic Johnson, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dr. King's funeral, the Grammys, the NAACP Image Awards, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Walter Mondale, John Wooden, Governor Jerry Brown, and Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Charles Williams photographed for theCalifornia Eagle and the Los Angeles Sentinel as a freelance photographer. The earliest images in his collection are from the mid-1940s. His career was interrupted when Williams chose to relocate with his Japanese wife Yoshi Kuwahara and their daughter to Chicago rather than have them sent to a relocation camp. Upon his return to Los Angeles, he began his wide ranging coverage of the African American community covering the Civil Rights Movement, churches, politics, social activities, and celebrities. Williams also established The California School of Photography and gave many aspiring photographers their start. He continued working as a photographer himself and became the official photographer for Los Angeles City Councilman Gordon Hahn, eventually becoming Hahn's field deputy. As a result, Williams' coverage of the Counsel and other city activities is especially rich. His association with Hahn also provided him access to many political activities including coverage of Richard Nixon's campaign for governor in Los Angeles.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The photographs in this collection are the result of research on adaptation to the physical and political environment of the indigenous Cañarí of Juncal, Ecuador, as well as their concept of the world. Anthropologists Niels Fock and Eva Krener did this research from September 1973 to August 1974, and from August 1977 to January 1978. Their work was made possible with the financial support of the Government Council of Humanist Studies and the University of Copenhagen. A representative sample of the material culture of the indigenous Cañarís, such as traditional costumes and utility items, has been deposited with the Ethnographic Collection of the National Museum of Denmark. In 1954 Niels Fock conducted an anthropological study on the indigenous Waiwai in British Guiana and in 1958 and 1961 on the indigenous Mataco in Argentina.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the winter of 1833–34, the Numak'aki (Mandan) war chief Mató-Tópe (ca. 1784–1837) visited the painting studio kept by Swiss painter Karl Bodmer (1809–93) at Fort Clark, a trading post in what is now North Dakota, fifty-five times. This project argues that this shared studio space and its activities are an extension of the Middle Ground, or the cultural arena co-created by Native and non-Native peoples on the French frontier. The Numak'aki name that local warriors bestowed upon Bodmer (Kapúska, or "Forcefully Makes Marks") demonstrates this co-creation by describing the artist's practices through a Numak'aki lens, rather than a Western one—a testimony to the co-operation of two distinct cultural systems within the Fort Clark studio. The project's digital platform then models this argument in presenting the project's related archives through both Native and non-Native frameworks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Comparative Mission Archaeology Portal (CMAP) digital database was developed in collaboration with the Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery (DAACS; www.daacs.org). It includes entries from about 60,000 artifacts from archaeological investigations at three seventeenth-century Franciscan mission sites in the Spanish colony of Florida. There are a large number of attribute fields related to both qualitative and quantitative attributes of Native American and European ceramics, stone tools and debitage, and a variety of artifacts of European origin that include religious, architectural, and personal adornment objects. Pictures of important artifact types as well as unusual or noteworthy objects also are included in the database. Supplementary information includes historical background on missions, histories of archaeological investigations, and excavation protocols. This database provides a rigorous standardization of data for the systematic and quantitative comparison of assemblages from multiple sites.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 2009, The Papers partnered with Senior Digital Editor Dr. Douglas Seefeldt and Katherine Walter, co-director of the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) to build the William F. Cody Archive (Cody Archive) www.CodyArchive.org, which launched in October 2011. Since that time, Associate Editors from more than 10 institutions have identified, collected, and interpreted historical documents related to William F. Cody, the Wild West exhibition, and its national and international legacy. This collaboration has led to the scanning of more than 40,000 documents and photographs from collections held by the McCracken Research Library in addition to 20,000 more archival documents from online databases and collections across the United States and Europe.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The primary aim of this project has been to reconstruct early precolonial histories of gender, family, and status in Bantu speaking communities that have historically developed matrilineal institutions. These historical reconstructions, stretching back at times three thousand years, are rooted in understanding people's ideas and values captured in the words communities developed.   Thus language data are the core of this historical record. In addition to language data collected from modern day speakers and in dictionaries compiled over the last 150 years - consulted in libraries, archives, and personal collections - ethnographic surveys, oral traditions (written and orally recounted) have been important in contextualizing verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech.   These materials provide critical context for comparative analyses and broader reconstructions. The more recently collected research materials compliment the linguistic, ethnographic, oral, and archaeological data each of the collaborators has collected since the mid-1990s.   Collectively the materials provide concrete material aspects of life as well as more abstract, metaphorical that capture the real meanings of words and ideas. Literal speech can often confuse native speakers while metaphorical speech expresses layers of expansive meaning and captures the imaginations and hearts of native speakers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a  long-term project to document the lexicosemantics of the Nahuat spoken in the municipality of Cuetzalan del Progreso, Puebla. Over the past 6 months Amith and Ceferino Salgado have finished reviewing each of the 8,000 + entries in terms of sense definitions and illustrative sentences (at least one for every sense). Illustrative sentences are both elaborated by the three native speaker editors and taken from over 200 hours of digital audio recordings (all of which has been transcribed). By the end of this Level 1 Mesolex project the team hopes to have 9,000 entries and 20,000 illustrative sentences, divided between those that were edited and recorded by the lexicographic team and those that were selected and extracted from the corpus.  The location of the lexical database has changed to https://mesolex-frontend-develop-eztzm.ondigitalocean.app/azz</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project involves collection, analysis, digital mapping, and interpretation of historical linguistic data relating to more than seventy Bantu-speaking societies living across Eastern and Central Africa. It is an examination of the structures and cultural ideas underpinning the world's Bantu speakers constructed across time and space.  Our own work has focused on family relations and generational education and status. This project in particular is funded by an NEH collaborative grant: Expressions and Transformations of Gender, Family, and Status in Eastern and Central Africa 500-1800 CE (RZ-249953-16). This has culminated in several scholarly products, including a book entitled Family before Gender: A History of Central and Eastern Africa, c. 500-1900 and how historically matrilineages underpinned the way communities determined organization and inheritance.  This collaboration is centered on questions about lineage and gender as dimensions of authority, identity, belonging, and worldview historically. It builds on the esteemed work of colleagues who have undertaken historical studies of gender in Africa to interrogate epistemological assumptions. We collected new sets of linguistic data and focused on spheres related to the above inquiries for approximately seventy societies across Zambia, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mozambique. We have produced a history examining how historically matrilineages underpinned the way communities determined organization, inheritance, and social authority. We leverage our prior individual work in Africa for a comparative trans-regional analysis and expand the geographic and linguistic scope.  This website invites curious people, scholars, teachers and students to explore our language evidence along with oral traditions, photos of relevant art, dictionaries, missionariesâ€™ reports, archaeological studies and ethnographic collections of the Bantu speaking people in the Bantu Matrilineal Belt.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Complete Letters of Willa Cather is an endeavor to publish, for the first time, the collected correspondence of one of the most significant and widely-read American novelists of the twentieth century. The author of My Àntonia, A Lost Lady, The Professor's House, Death Comes for the Archbishop, and many other celebrated books, Willa Cather was a woman with a compelling personal story, remarkable professional accomplishments, and a courageously independent life; her personal writings are of deep interest to many. The letters, long withheld from publication and even from quotation due to restrictions in Cather's will, provide unparalleled insight into the life, creative imagination, and professional and social context of this extraordinary woman. The project is supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and with the cooperation of Willa Cather Foundation in Red Cloud, Nebraska.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a long-term project to document the lexicosemantics of the Mixtec spoken in the village of Yoloxóchitl, municipality of San Luis Acátlan, state of Guerrero, Mexico. Over the past several years Amith and Rey Castillo have been reviewing 2,500 + entries in terms of the orthography and gloss for each entry. Castillo has already recorded each headword, repeated three times in a high quality digital audio recording and each recording will be linked to its headword in the online Mesolex dictionary. Subsequently they will record cognate sets from 4 neighboring villages and spend a year reviewing the sense definitions and illustrative sentences for each entry. By the end of this Level 1 Mesolex project the team hopes to have 2,500 entries with linked headword recordings from Yoloxóchitl and at least one other village as well as preliminary sense definitions for each entry. The lexical database and recordings will be archived and published as a corpus by the Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania. Presently a reduced version of this corpus is available at OpenSLR</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of Kripke's most significant contributions to philosophy can be found in his treatment of the concept of truth in his article "Outline of a Theory of Truth."   In his "Outline," Kripke gave a new and revolutionary solution to the Liar paradox and related paradoxes that preserves the intuitive notion of truth to a great extent. But Kripke's "Outline" is just that: an outline. It omits many of the details of Kripke's philosophical views, as well as much of the specific mathematical machinery needed for fleshing them out. Fortunately, Kripke addressed the gaps and covered a great deal of new ground in four seminars given at Princeton University in the Spring semester of 1987, the Spring semester of 1988, the Fall semester of 1988, and the Spring semester of 1989. These seminars comprise a total of forty-two classes completely devoted to the theory of truth.  It should be noted that in these seminars, delivered more than ten years after the publication of the "Outline", Kripke goes beyond completing the agenda he had set up in the ‘70s. He addresses objections directed at his own theory, introduces modifications, and discusses rival theories that appeared after the publication of the "Outline". For instance, in response to objections that the truth-teller sentence (‘This very sentence is true') ought to be regarded as false since there is no reason to think it true, Kripke shows how this could be accommodated in his theory. The Digital Transcripts of Saul Kripke's Princeton Seminars on the Theory of Truth (1987-1989) include all the original typewritten manuscripts. Unfortunately, because the manuscripts contain a wealth of formal symbolism, it was impossible to use a program for automatically converting the manuscripts to digital form and the process had to be done manually. The completely retyped digital version incorporates handwritten comments in the margins, additional proofs, and has been checked against the audio of the seminars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The LOOK Magazine collection is the single largest collection in the Museum's holdings, consisting of over 2,000 assignments from 41 different photographers made for the magazine between 1938 and 1968. LOOK magazine was founded in 1937 and published as a bi-weekly, general interest magazine. By the 1950s, it had evolved into a popular magazine with a national circulation, and by the late 60s, it reached a peak circulation of nearly 8 million readers. LOOK was well known for its photography, with images by such prominent photographers as Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Rothstein, John Vachon, Charlotte Brooks, Frank Bauman, Jim Hansen, Paul Fusco, and Tony Vaccaro. Each published assignment usually featured no more than a dozen images, and the number of images taken for a single assignment varied from a few dozen to a few hundred.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This Sounding Spirit pilot digital library features songbooks and hymnals published across the southern United States from 1850 to 1925. Spanning holdings from four partner archives, the digital library's twenty-two books include words-only hymnals, gospel songbooks, spiritual collections, and shape-note tunebooks, demonstrating the wide variety of form, content, and presentation in southern vernacular sacred songbooks. These songbooks employ competing notation systems and vary in musical style from dispersed harmony fuging tunes and plain tunes of the shape-note repertoire, to antiphonal gospel, to classically inspired arrangements of African American spirituals, to words-only hymns in Muskokee sung in unison, to tunes in oral tradition shared among southern black and white congregations.  Organized into collections that highlight texts' associated places, populations, genres, and denominational affiliations, the digital library allows for rich engagement with songbooks and hymnals seminal in their respective eras, but historically underrepresented in both archival holdings and scholarship. These works and collections illustrate the primacy of songbooks to the dynamic encounters among white, black, and native communities navigating modernizing forces across the US South and beyond.  In selecting volumes for the pilot site, Sounding Spirit's music bibliographer Erin Fulton, project director, Jesse P. Karlsberg, and project manager, Meredith Doster, collaborated with content consultants at each partner archive to balance the diversity of this 22-volume corpus with each collection's strengths. Additional criteria guiding the selection included contemporaneous significance, influence, rarity, and existence of digitized copies or available facsimiles.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This dataset is a checklist of sacred vernacular songbooks from the southern United States and its diasporas published between 1850 and 1925. The checklist features works primarily housed at the Pitts Theology Library at Emory University, the John Jacob Niles Center for American Music at the University of Kentucky, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Archives and Special Collections, and the Center for Popular Music at Middle Tennessee State University. The checklist assembles basic bibliographic data otherwise dispersed across the catalogs of numerous repositories. The dataset also includes data points that standard catalog records do not encompass. For instance, whenever discernable, information about denominational orientation, known distributors, and notation style is clearly indicated.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a multimedia collection focusing on the Baniwa people of the Northwest Amazon, and in particular on shamanic practices, ceremony, mythology, prophet movements, traditional knowledge about illnesses and healing, and the history and ethnography of the Baniwa people. Most of the materials in this collection was collected or created by Robin M. Wright during trips to Baniwa communities of the Aiary and Içana rivers of the Upper Rio Negro region of the Brazilian Amazon, and visits to museums and archives. During his career as an academic researcher in Brazil and the United States, Wright has focused on the history of the Baniwa people and their religious practices, including the effects of prophet movements and evangelization within the region, publishing several books on these subjects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Threads of Our Community: A History of the Avenir Museum is a virtual exhibition of the Avenir Museum of Design and Merchandising, created in part with funding from a CARES grant during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The concept for the exhibition was originally developed before the pandemic hit and planned to open with a physical exhibition in Fall 2020. Unable to host any events in physical spaces, the virtual exhibition then became an avenue for bringing humanities and education to the public. The exhibition is a collection of digitized items showcasing the growth Avenir Museum has undergone. The Avenir began as a small teaching collection in the 1950s and has since grown into a collection of approximately 25,000 historic clothing and textile artifacts, housed in a state-of-the-art museum facility. This digital collection consists of materials from the virtual exhibition dated 1986 to 2010 and including photographs, brochures, catalogs, newspaper articles, and photographic slides.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Listening to War digital collection brings together first-person accounts of veterans and civilians in Wisconsin during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. These stories of everyday life during wartime come from men and women who served on the battlefront; nurses, journalists, shipbuilders, and others who contributed to wartime work at home and abroad; Holocaust survivors who immigrated from Europe to Wisconsin after World War II; and Hmong refugees from Laos who were resettled in the state following the Vietnam War. Listening to War: Wisconsin's Wartime Oral Histories is coordinated by Recollection Wisconsin and supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Partners in this project include the Wisconsin Historical Society, the Wisconsin Veterans Museum, and the 22 libraries, archives, museums, and veterans' organizations that contributed materials to this collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection contains digital transcriptions of originally handwritten transcriptions of audio recordings of language variation surveys in Mixtec (and other closely related) languages. The audio recordings that correspond to these transcriptions are found can be found in the MesoAmerican Languages Collection of Kathryn Josserand. This collection contains three kinds of documents: Texts with the digital transcriptions in PDF formatting Images and Texts which are PDF documents showing the image of the manuscript alongside their transcription, and Datasets that present survey data in tabular CSV formats.  These materials were produced by volunteer transcribers as part of an NEH-funded pilot project to crowdsource the transcription of the handwritten documents. This project was supervised by Ryan Sullivant with technical assistance by May Helena Plumb.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>MAPPING COVID-19 STREET ART: Artists and writers producing work in the streets – including tags, graffiti, murals, stickers, and other installations on walls, pavement, and signs – are in a unique position to respond quickly and effectively in a moment of crisis. Street art's ephemeral nature serves to reveal very immediate and sometimes fleeting responses, often in a manner that can be raw and direct. At the same time, in the context of a crisis, street art also has the potential to transform urban space and foster a sustained political dialogue, reaching a wide audience, particularly when museums and galleries are shuttered. For all of these reasons, it is not surprising to see an explosion of street art around the world created in response to the Covid-19 global pandemic, even as our movement in public spaces is limited due to public health concerns. Through the seminar, the author was able to incorporate more material from Brazil into the database, most notably work by the São Paulo collective Nós Artivistas. The author also connected with these artists personally—the seminar really gave the participant a good framework for understanding their work.</Abstract>

Using an archive of photographs compiled during Dr. Gross’ 2004-2019 field research in the region, it is the first effort to make available the history of genealogical documentation in the Ismaili community as a source for local knowledge of the Ismaili tradition of Badakhshan.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>On Our Own Ground: Pequot Community Papers, 1813-1850   The Digital Humanities grant product includes digital images, transcriptions, annotations, interactive biographies, geographies, and commentary generated and organized by NNRC editors with the assistance editorial assistants from the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot Nations. Community scholars from the Eastern and Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nations reviewed content, worked collaboratively with Editors in the annotation process, adding information, commentary and perspective.  The records, a series of 19th-Century Eastern and Mashantucket Pequot manuscript overseer reports, detail the income and expenses of two Native communities and include debt accounting through goods and services delivered to tribal members and income derived from land rental or labor, providing unique insights into the daily lives of Native people in Early Republic Connecticut.   These materials are part of an important but often overlooked collection that provides insight into the daily life of these two communities. The records are freely-accessible on the NNRC's digital platform, the Native Northeast Portal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The present resource is a database version (by Kenia Velasco) of a comparative dictionary by the abovementioned authors, which was the result of 30-years of research into five historical Chol sources, here put together in a comparative dictionary: (1) LF 1892: Eighteenth Century Chol of Tila, Chiapas: The earliest published Chol lexicon is that of León Fernández (1892), which is a transcription of data recorded in Tila, Chiapas, in 1789. Chol was apparently missed in the sixteenth century survey represented by the Relaciones Geográficas (Harvey 1972), and no major documents are known from the earliest Colonial period (Bright 1967, Hellmuth 1970), including the catechisms, grammars, and vocabularies that must have been produced during the period when Chol speakers were being missionized and relocated (de Vos 1980a,b); (2) Campbell 1984: Colonial Chol Day Names: The Chol day names reported in this dictionary are based on those published by Lyle Campbell in 1984; (3) Stoll 1938: The Nineteenth-Century Chol Vocabulary of C. H. Berendt: This extensive Chol lexicon was recorded by the German scholar C. H. Berendt towards the middle of the nineteenth century, and remained unpublished until after his death; (4) Sapper (1907): A Late Nineteenth-Century Chol Wordlist: An extensive Chol word list, apparently collected just before the end of the nineteenth century, was published in the proceedings of the 15th International Congress of Americanists by Karl Sapper, German ethnographer and historian. Sapper (1907:440-458) presented data from the two major Chol dialects, those of Tila and Tumbalá (and their dependencies). He accompanied the Chol data with comparative data from Chortí and Pocomam; (5) Starr (1902): Two Turn-of-the-Century Chol Wordlists: Two Chol word lists appear as appendices to Frederick Starr's Notes Upon the Ethnography of Southern Mexico (Proceedings of the Davenport Academy of Sciences 9:63-172, 1902).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>South Asia has many traditions of nationalist iconography of divine mother figures In this essay, however, we will focus on the history of visual representation of Nepal's national founding father, Prithvinarayan Shah (r. 1742–75). While the trope of the nation-as-mother is also present in Nepal, as in the commonly-used metaphor of ‘Nepal Aama', we suggest that the history of visual representation of Prithvinarayan Shah is a particularly interesting lens through which to examine Nepali nationalism because of the fact that his legacy is highly controversial in contemporary Nepal. The king from Gorkha is hailed by many as the nation-builder (rastranirmata), statesman par excellence, and the symbol of national unity for his role in the territorial unification of modern Nepal in the 18th century. On the other hand, many see him as a ruthless conqueror, a warlord, and an imperialist whose legacy of conquest casts a shadow over Nepali society even to this day. Consequently, images of Prithvinarayan Shah play a key role in ideological and political debates over the Nepali past and future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Marie Mancini (1639-1715) was famous as the first love of Louis XIV of France, and later she and her sister Hortense became scandalous celebrities by running away from their husbands and traveling unaccompanied through much of Western Europe. Marie's unpublished letters to Lorenzo Colonna (her estranged husband) and others reside in an Italian archive. This project will publish them online.  Begun in Spring 2020, this project seeks to publish Marie Mancini's approximately 900 letters that are held in the Colonna Archive, Library of the Abbey of Santa Scolastica, in Subiaco, Italy. There are approximately 100 transcribed letters currently available so far, six of which have been translated into English.  Ultimately, the goal of this project is not only to provide a space for Marie Mancini's voice to be freely accessed, but also to provide avenues for historical exploration. To this end, users may:  Explore and read the letters; Browse Marie's correspondence in chronological order; View her travels across Europe; Download the letters' text for further research.  ...with more options to come!</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This first volume of two comprises the texts as texts, whether full stories, short songs, cultural phrases and prayers. The major sources for such texts are Pliny E. Goddard (1909, 1906; working with Bill Ray), Edwin M. Loeb (1932; working with Lucy (Cooke) Ray, Martina (Ray) Bell, and Gill Ray) and John P. Harrington (1942; working with Martina (Ray) Bell and Gill Ray). The Cahto words are transcribed into the Community's standard writing system, then in the second line broken into major word parts, then glossed according to the breakdown, and then with a whole word gloss below, and finally grammatical category. After this there follows a somewhat modernized translation, the original author's translation, and the original author's word for word translation (if provided). Then finally the original author's transcription of the line(s). In the case of many of the Goddard texts there are two original transcription lines, one from the published text collection (1909)  and one from the field notebooks (1906).</Abstract>

The sources are Goddard's field notebooks (Goddard 1906, working with Bill Ray and Rose Ray), Merriam's Kato vocabulary list (Merriam 1850-1974), and Sapir's brief work with Bill Ray and Goddard (Goddard &amp;amp; Sapir 1907-1908). The Cahto words are transcribed into the Community's standard writing system, then in the second line broken into major word parts, then glossed according to the breakdown, and then with a whole word gloss below, and finally grammatical category.

		<Abstract>The Cahto (also spelled "Kato") language is a California Athabaskan language of the Eel River group in northern Mendocino county, California. This dictionary is the result of the author's twenty-one years' evening and weekend research on the language, and a final year finishing the dictionary full-time, thanks to NEH funding (see Acknowledgements). This stands as the first dictionary for Cahto, and only the second dictionary for any California Athabaskan language, the first being Golla's Hupa Language Dictionary. The dictionary is comprised of over 4,600 main Cahto headwords and 3,100 variants (mostly inflected forms), extracted from nearly 11,000 forms documented by scholars between the 1850's and the 2000's, but most prolifically in the first decades of the 20th century by Pliny Earle Goddard, J. P. Harrington, Edward Sapir, C. Hart Merriam, Edward Curtis, and others. This 2021 updated edition results from another NEH-funded project analyzing Cahto texts, which has resulted in finding several hundred more forms and variants, and the linking of text examples into a significant percentage of main entries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Chamisa: A Journal of Literary, Performance, and Visual Arts of the Greater Southwest is sponsored by the Southwest Hispanic Research Institute* (SHRI) at the University of New Mexico. The arts of the southwest region are abundant, diverse, and often blur the boundaries between categories normally accepted as defining the structural hierarchies of the art world. As these forms change, they enrich and redefine the cultural landscape. The journal seeks to capture the dynamic ways that the creative arts in this region have developed and continue to advance over time and in relation to the diverse composition of its communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Governor of Tennessee, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and eleventh president of the United States, James K. Polk was a fierce Jacksonian who expanded the nation's boundaries more than anyone since Thomas Jefferson. He is remembered today as one of the strongest presidents of the nineteenth century. Like Andrew Jackson before him, Polk increased the power of the presidency in ways that extend to this day. When complete, this digital edition of Polk's correspondence will include the complete contents of the print edition's fourteen volumes. It is fully searchable, and is interoperable with other titles in the Antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction collection.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Regardless of race, class, or gender, nineteenth-century Americans contacted their governors about every concern imaginable. That makes governors' collections an invaluable resource for "hearing" from individuals whose voices are often missing in traditional sources, as well as from those who wielded significant power during the Civil War and Reconstruction eras.  The Civil War &amp;amp; Reconstruction Governors of Mississippi Project (CWRGM) is digitizing, transcribing, and annotating these valuable records from Mississippi's governors' offices and making them freely available online. The project covers nine administrations, beginning amid rumblings of secession in late 1859, continuing through civil war, emancipation, occupation, and Reconstruction, ending in the early Jim Crow South in 1882. Thanks to the diverse nature of this collection, CWRGM documents touch on nearly every topic imaginable. These include questions of loyalty and dissent, the process of emancipation and the changing definition of citizenship, and military experiences that ranged from state militias to Confederate national service to the role of nearly 20,000 Mississippians who served in the Union Army and Navy. The collections also contribute to ongoing debates about Civil War memory and commemoration, and help users explore the question of whose experiences are preserved and how, and whose are ignored or erased.  This site features documents in the collection as they are digitized, transcribed, and provided with early annotations through subject tagging features. We encourage users to review the "How to Get Started" and "Explore the Collection" sections that offer suggestions on how to best search the collection. "Educator Resources" offers a sampling of about eighty documents that spotlight how the collection is deepening our understanding of this era, and includes short contextualizing essays, lesson plan</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project is an open access digital bilingual edition of the Correio de Africa [The Africa Mail], a pan-Africanist newspaper published in Lisbon between 1921-1924, supplemented by a robust scholarly apparatus. Its comparative and multilingual approach generates new perspectives on the interconnectedness of colonialism, imperialism, literary and cultural history, politics, labor, migration, environmentalism, race and racism, linguistics, journalism, photography and advertising, women's activism, and transnationalism;  The digital format presents high-quality scans of the original newspaper pages, enhanced by a tool that hovers over the original Portuguese text to provide the English translation. The inclusion of a scholarly apparatus that is accessible through embedded notes and links is calculated to be unobtrusive, as well as  informative and educational at every level of interest and expertise. The interface is adaptable to mobile as well as computer screens.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Airing on public television in 1990, as the second half of the landmark 14-part series Eyes on the Prize, Eyes on the Prize: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965-1985, explores the tumultuous history of civil rights after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, including the movement of activism from the South into Northern cities, the rise of Black Power and the Black Panthers, the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., civil unrest in cities such as Detroit, tensions over school busing programs, and increasing African American engagement in local and national politics. Both parts of Eyes on the Prize were devoted to telling a version of the civil rights story that was not a standard, simplified narrative. Hampton and his team were committed to going deeper. Instead of summarizing the headlines or two-minute newscasts, Blackside, Inc. sought out the grassroots folks most involved in a given event, action, or culturally historic moment in order to provide a more nuanced version of history, messy and full of conflict and contradictions. In order for an interviewee to be included in the programs, that person had to be an actual participant in the event in question. Prominent scholars had their place as close advisors and consultants to Eyes on the Prize I and II, but they were not to appear on film. To be on camera, the person had to have been part of the history itself. This was to be the most complete and detailed telling of the civil rights story ever attempted, and the ripples from this landmark television event were felt throughout both the academy and popular culture for decades to come.   All 183 interviews conducted for Eyes on the Prize II constitute a treasure trove of first-hand information about the civil rights movement that can be utilized by students, scholars, and media makers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Go for Broke National Education Center Collection contains materials from the Go for Broke National Education Center.  Hanashi Oral History Program  The Hanashi Oral History Program subcollection is comprised of approximately 1,100 oral histories of Japanese-American WWII veterans and their contemporaries in the war effort gathered by the Go for Broke National Education Center. The mission of this program, initiated in 1998, is to gather and preserve the life stories of Japanese American war veterans. Interviewees include Senator Daniel Inouye and others who were highly decorated for their service and bravery as they reflect on the historical significance of WWII, their reasons for serving, the incarceration of their families in camps, their service in segregated Japanese-American combat units, and the complexities of their wartime experiences.  Hiroshi Sugiyama Collection, circa 1941-1945  The Hiroshi Sugiyama Collection, circa 1941-1945, is comprised of photographs, memorabilia, correspondence, and bound volumes relating to Hiroshi Sugiyama, a medic who served with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in World War II. The subcollection focuses on Sugiyama's military service, as many of the items are military regalia that show signs of Sugiyama's personalization. A portion of the photographs and correspondence are personal in nature. Some items of note are letters from Sugiyama to family members incarcerated in camps and Sugiyama's posthumously awarded Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals. Materials are in English and Japanese.  Materials from the Hanashi Oral History Program and Hiroshi Sugiyama Collection, circa 1941-1945 are part of the L. A. as Subject Community Histories Digitization Project. Thanks to generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (https://www.neh.gov/), the USC Libraries are digitizing this collection for public access.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Filipino American Library Collection consists of materials owned by the Filipino American Library in Historic Filipinotown that were transferred to the University of Southern California Special Collections in 2017.  The Filipino-American Library was founded in a church basement in 1985 as the Pilipino American Reading Room and Library (PARRAL) in a neighborhood close to Echo Park by Helen Agcaoili Summers Brown, affectionately referred to as "Auntie Helen" in the local community. In January of 2000 PARRAL moved to a new location on Temple Street and was renamed the Filipino American Library (FAL). It contained the largest collection of Filipino and Filipino American reading materials at more than 6,000 titles, and promoted literacy and cultural engagement through many community programs and exhibits. When the FAL closed its doors, its collections were dispersed among the USC Libraries and the Echo Park Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library.  Items selected by affiliates of the FAL to be made digitally available include lantern slides, bound volumes, photographic prints, maps, and loose printed materials that all reveal the Filipino American experience spanning life in the Philippines, contributions by Filipino Americans in the World War II effort, and the acculturation and growth of the Filipino American community in Southern California. Materials are written in English, Tagalog, and Ilocano. Highlights of the Filipino American Library Collection include:  ? Items commemorating Filipino veterans from World War II, including publications and a certificate of commendation from President Clinton ? Bilingual short stories written by staff from the Asian American Bilingual Center about Asian immigrants and their journey and settlement to the United States ? Reports, summaries, and recommendations surrounding the health, education, and welfare of Asian Americans ? Ephemeral materials from the Philippines</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles Collection currently consists of approximately 400 sermons given by Reverend Cecil "Chip" Murray. These recordings capture the evolution of Reverend Murray's thinking during his time leading the church in addition to the messages he gave his congregation after pivotal moments in U.S. life, such as the acquittal of the LAPD officers captured on video beating Rodney King. These sermons, delivered with passion, great humor, and insights into the structural inequalities that led to events like the 1992 L.A. civil unrest, are a record of important events interpreted through the lens of Rev. Murray's socially engaged African-American Christianity. Originally captured on VHS, a selection of these sermons have been digitized by the USC Digital Repository and uploaded and transcribed for optimum access in the Digital Library. Founded by Biddy Mason in 1872, the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles (also known as the First AME, or FAME Church) is the oldest African-American church in Southern California. During his 27 years as pastor, Reverend Murray transformed a small congregation of 250 people into an 18,000-member institution that brought jobs, housing, and corporate investment into South L.A. neighborhoods. After the 1992 civil unrest, the economic development arm of the church brought more than $400 million in investments to L.A.'s minority and low-income neighborhoods. After retiring from his ministry in 2004, Reverend Murray was named a senior fellow of the USC Center for Religion and Civic Culture (CRCC). He chairs the USC Cecil Murray Center for Community Engagement, a leadership training and capacity-building organization that equips clergy and lay leaders to guide their communities into full partnership in the development of underserved neighborhoods in Greater Los Angeles.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Pasadena Museum of History (PMH) is located on the Fenye's Mansion grounds on Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena. PMH maintains the area's largest and most comprehensive collection of documents and artifacts related to the history of Pasadena and the west San Gabriel Valley. The ever-expanding collection spans years from 1834 to the present.  Pasadena Museum of History's Black History Collection is comprised of photographs, letters, family records, property deeds, and other materials revealing history of African-American community in Pasadena. This collection was a result of a documentary, Changing Rose, created by PMH in 1984. Robin Kelley, an American historian, interviewed black community members and collected photographs and memorabilia for the documentary, which make up the bulk of the collection. Many of these materials date from the early 20th century, and shed light on a less-visible period in African-American life prior to the second Great Migration. The collection tells the stories and struggles of black citizens who either migrated or grew up in Pasadena. The interview tapes in this collection were digitized as a part of California Revealed Project and can be accessed at https:/californiarevealed.org/collections/pasadena-museum-history. PMH staff chose to digitize only the materials that they have explicit copyrights to.  Thanks to generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (https://www.neh.gov/), the USC Libraries are digitizing this collection for public access as part of the L.A. as Subject Community Histories Digitization Project.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum Collection, 1830-1930 consists of materials from the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum in the City of Industry, California. The Homestead Museum is located in a former Mexican rancho and is home to rich collections documenting many aspects of Southern California history between 1830 and 1930.  Staff from the Homestead Museum have selected approximately 500 photographs and ephemera highlighting Mexican-American, Chinese-American, and Japanese-American life in the Los Angeles region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among these items are broadsides from two Mexican-American theatres in Boyle Heights during the 1920s and an 1863 Democratic party poster written in Spanish. Photographs depicting businesses, celebrations such as festivals and parades, and daily life in these early communities are also included in this collection. These materials are some of the rare traces of mass entertainment and community life of the region during this era, as much was lost in the rapid development of Los Angeles after World War II.  Materials from the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum Collection are part of the L. A. as Subject Community Histories Digitization Project. Thanks to generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the USC Libraries are digitizing this collection for public access.  Edit information</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Judy Blankenship is a documentary photographer and writer who has lived and worked in Cañar, Ecuador for varying lengths of time since 1991. With a Cañari colleague she has created Archivo Cultural de los Cañaris, a local archive of photographs, recordings, videos, and documents that relate to the history of the region since the 1960s. For this and for AILLA, she facilitated the collections of ex-Peace Corps volunteers in Cañar (1966-1968), as well as those of two Danish anthropologists, Eva Krener and Niels Fock (1973-77). Her collection at AILLA includes scanned images from her early work (1992-2005) and born-digital from 2005-2022, as well as audio and video recordings. Her physical collection will eventually be a part of the Benson Latin American Collection.The collection provides a record of the Cañari culture and people of Ecuador through video and photographs of public ceremonies and events, daily life and culture, as well as posed portraits of Cañaris. The videos and digital photographs in this collection have been arranged into folders according to the cultural themes they depict. Other folders in this collection are organized according to their original format: audio cassettes, minidisc recordings, and various photographic formats. One folder contains recordings forming an oral history of the agrarian reform movement in Cañar in the 1960s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Digital Archive of Huhugam Archaeology contains over 1,200 digital datasets, documents, reports and images focused on the ancient Huhugam (1500 B.C. – 1450 A.D.) of the southwestern U.S. These files are primarily "grey literature," that is, unpublished reports and data sets that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.  By creating this collection, we hope this comprehensive archive will:      Transform scholars' ability to answer questions about Huhugam society and will provide crucial long-term data for comparative studies.  1. Give Indigenous communities access to a wealth of archaeological research on ancestral populations. 2. Allow the general public to obtain information about this fascinating ancient culture by directly accessing the digital archive.  Archive development is guided by a crowd-sourced survey and workshops designed to understand the needs of diverse users. The archive will be curated by tDAR, an established digital repository that provides free Web discovery and access to its holdings and pursues a robust program of digital data preservation.</Abstract>

While rehousing, she expanded and modernized the museum's typewritten finding guides for all 34 archival collections, adding updated locations, context, related collections, and converting the existing record-level inventory into computer-readable text.  These finding guides will ultimately be available on the Whaling Museum's website and OCLC's ArchviesGrid.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Project Co-Director Dan Trepal's postdoctoral research position duties focused on the geocoding, cleaning / preparation and record-linking of several historical big datasets during Year 1 (with assistance from Project Geospatial Research Scientist Ryan Williams as well as students Juip, Lizzadro-McPherson, Spikberg, and Stone). The following datasets were integrated into the CC-HSDI and are being prepared for record-linking, or are in the process of being record-linked:  ?Decennial US Census (years: 1880 and 1900-1940): 100% of individuals recorded in the census for our study area (~379,000 individuals) geocoded; attribute tables reviewed and normalized in preparation for record linking. Completed record linking between 1920 Census and 1918 School Records. We have also integrated the IPUMS Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (MLP) crosswalk tables into the CC-HSDI. This IPUMS-developed tool has permitted us to crosslink approximately 40% of individuals within our overall US census dataset for the census years 1910 through 1930. In addition, we have identified within this dataset and for our study area the in-migration (years: 1910, 1920, 1930)  and out-migration (years: 1920, 1930, 1940) cohorts for three decades each. This work is ongoing. ?School Records (1904-1926): 25,879 individual records transcribed from original documents and reformatted as normalized tables. Completed geocoding and record linking of all records. ?Sanitation Reports, Calumet &amp;amp; Hecla Mining Co. Medical Department (1910-1921): 2,225 individual records geocoded; attribute tables reviewed and normalized in preparation for record linking with other CC-HSDI datasets. ?Mining Company Home ownership data. Incorporated into the CC-HSDI Calumet and Hecla Mining Company home ownership / lease status data for the period c. 1908-1920 digitized from historical cartography. After digitizing, this information was appended to 7,594 existing historical building polygons within the CC-HSDI's existing buil</Abstract>

The Stories of Southern Oregon project celebrates heritage agriculture, the timber industry, mining, the mills and more with video family histories of our region's folks, fields, forests and foods, and also photographs, documents and other ephemera. These materials give texture, context and nuance to Southern Oregon's history, the families that have lived here and our shared cultural traditions. The Stories project has been funded by grants to Southern Oregon University from the Oregon Heritage Commission, the National Endowment for the Humanities Common Heritage Program, the Institute for Museum and Library Services and the Jackson County Cultural Coalition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This digital archive provides powerful search capabilities enabling users to search for over 25,000 individual and organizational names in a database of nearly 150,000 documents. These documents encompass a period of rapid industrialization and growth in the scale of enterprise from the Civil War to the onset of the Great Depression. In addition to Edison's well-known contributions to the development of electric light and power, sound recording, and motion pictures, they also document his contributions to many other industries; including telecommunications (telegraph and telephone), electric batteries, mining, chemical production, cement manufacture, and office and home appliances. They include records of his pioneering laboratories and of the numerous companies he established at home and abroad. In addition they provide extensive documentation of his family and of his role as a symbol of American ingenuity.  Most of the documents come from the extensive archives of the Thomas Edison National Historical Park and were scanned from our microfilm edition. In addition, there are documents from nearly 150 other repositories and private collections. The edition will eventually include Edison's 1,093 U.S. Patents and over 500 motion picture catalogs produced by American producers and distributors between 1894 and 1908.  Our digital edition (also known as a digital archive or digital library) is composed of documents and item sets. "Documents" is a generic term that can also describe things like notebooks, scrapbooks, account books, and other bound volumes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Freedom on the Move is a database of fugitives from North American slavery. With the advent of newspapers in the American colonies, enslavers posted "runaway ads" to try to locate fugitives. Additionally, jailers posted ads describing people they had apprehended in search of the enslavers who claimed the fugitives as property.  Created to control the movement of enslaved people, the ads ultimately preserved the details of individual lives--their personality, appearance, and life story. Taken collectively, the ads constitute a detailed, concise, and rare source of information about the experiences of enslaved people. Freedom on the Move is compiling thousands of these stories of resistance that have never been accessible in one place.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The oral history project engaged several humanities fields. Oral history itself draws on oral tradition, and the project explicitly examined the impact of a new virus on the human environment. The project applied the tools of history to document that impact for future generations, as well as offering an initial historical analysis. It applied the social sciences by capturing data on the differential impacts of the virus on a variety of individuals from various geographical areas and socioeconomic statuses. Because the interviews were video recorded, the data will be far richer than conventional oral histories, and could be utilized by future social scientists in ways we cannot yet imagine. The project addressed developments of great interest to historians. Throughout the initial few weeks of national lockdowns due to the emerging pandemic crisis, West Virginia remained the one state without a single confirmed case of Covid-19. That changed on March 17, when the state"s first coronavirus infection appeared in Shepherdstown, home to Shepherd University. That case, as well as the state"s initial mishandling of it, made international news. As we saw in communities around the nation, after the first positive case, life quickly turned upside down. This project collected evidence about how the global pandemic impacted the lives of people in our region. It included African American and Hispanic interviewees, as well as West Virginians from underrepresented areas of the state. Interview audio, video, and transcriptions from the interviews were collected and are available online.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the major components of the project is to create a digital humanities website on Hurston, Ellison, and Murray to be housed on the Tuskegee University Archives Repository Website (www.tuskegee.edu/ArchivesRepository). The site includes research completed during the grant period and selected materials from the following valuable library collections: Zora Neale Hurston Collection, Albert Murray Papers, which Tuskegee University recently acquired, and the Ralph Ellison Collection. We anticipate researchers, educators, and students nationally and globally, would be able to use the site for the resources available to them. A digitized unpublished essay by Ellison, for example, gives rare access to his early compositions. Other items include important, never-before-published photographs and documents, as well as teaching and research resources, some from our K-12 Workshop, are a permanent addition to this website.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Below the Line" provides open-access resources for those interested in learning more about the feuilleton and its importance in the formation of modern Jewish cultures. Started in 2017, the project aims to foster conversation about and research into the feuilleton as a historical forum that attracted many different types of writing, writers, and readers. This site is intended for the general public, including educators, students, and scholars. We hope you will take a look at the original texts, get a sense of how the feuilleton appeared when it was first published, and read through the English translations — all with an eye toward what the feuilleton can tell us about the formation of modern Jewish cultures and new media landscapes today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>European artists have sought to create life-like images since the Renaissance. The techniques used by artists to impart realism to their paintings often rely on approaches based in mathematics, like linear perspective; yet the means used to assess the verisimilitude of realist paintings have remained subjective, even intuitive. An exploration of alternative and relatively objective methods for evaluating pictorial realism could enhance existing art historical research. We propose a machine-learning-based paradigm for studying pictorial realism in an explainable way. Unlike subjective evaluations made by art historians or computer-based painting analysis exploiting inexplicable learned features, our framework assesses realism by measuring the similarity between clouds painted by exceptionally skillful 19th-century landscape painters like John Constable and photographs of clouds. The experimental results of cloud classification show that Constable approximates more consistently than his contemporaries the formal features of actual clouds in his paintings. Our analyses suggest that artists working in the decades leading up to the invention of photography worked in a mode that anticipated some of the stylistic features of photography. The study is a springboard for deeper analyses of pictorial realism using computer vision and machine learning.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Based on the collection of nearly 500 films in the American Indian Film Gallery housed at the University of Arizona, this project tribesources mid-20th century educational and sponsored films about Native peoples of the U.S. Southwest and (coming soon!) Southern California by recording Native narrations and contextual information for film content from the Native communities they represent. The films contain valuable historical visual imagery, but the original narrations are often inaccurate and culturally uninformed. Tribesourcing places historical materials with the peoples they represent in order to tell the untold or suppressed story. As we have conceived it, tribesourcing is guided by the Protocols for Native American Archival Materials (2006).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Viola B. Muse (1898-1981) worked from 1936 through 1939 as an interviewer and writer in the Negro Writers Unit of the Florida Federal Writers Project in Jacksonville, Florida. Muse and the other writers in the Negro Writers Unit, including Zora Neale Hurston, attempted to document the achievements and folkways of African-American communities in Florida, and in Jacksonville specifically. The Viola Muse Digital Edition (VMDE) publishes Muse's Federal Writers Project notes and drafts for the first time, preserving Muse's documents as images while also transcribing them into faithful and readable formats. The VMDE includes historical maps that locate the homes of Muse's interview subjects and other localities mentioned, along with contextual essays on Muse's biography, the history of the Florida Federal Writers Project and the Florida Negro Writers Unit, and the geography of early 20th-century African American Jacksonville.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Rio de Janeiro Wet-Nursing Dataset" (RJWND) comprises all advertisements for wet nurses for the year of 1850 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, extracted from the city's main commercial newspaper, Jornal do Commercio. "Mercenary" wet nursing, what contemporaries called the practice of paying other women to breastfeed their children, was a thriving market throughout the nineteenth century. Most wet nurses were enslaved women, with freed women of color and white immigrant women also working in the trade. More rarely, white Brazilian women whose newborns had died advertised their milk. We can draw several conclusions from this data. Most importantly, RJWND demonstrates the ubiquity of wet nursing in urban Brazil. Women from all races, classes, and legal statuses participated in this activity, whether as elite mothers not breastfeeding their own children, or as free, freed, freed African, and enslaved women breastfeeding other women's children. It also sheds light on how enslavers valued wet nurses both for their reproductive labors (wet nursing) and their productive outputs (cleaning, cooking).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume of the Papers of John Adams chronicles in 341 letters John Adams's final duties as the American minister to Great Britain and the Netherlands. In the 28 months documented (February 1787 – May 1789), he petitioned the British ministry to halt impressment of American sailors, toured the English countryside, and observed parliamentary politics as the threat of a general war shadowed the continent. Adams salvaged American credit by contracting two new Dutch loans amid the political chaos triggered by William V's resurgence. Adams also penned the final two volumes of his work, A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America. He returned to the United States and a happy but brief retirement. By volume's end, John Adams resumed public life, ready to serve as America's first vice president. The letterpress volume was published in 2018 and was converted to the Adams Papers Digital Edition and made freely accessible to the public in March 2022.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project aims to collect, annotate, and mediate newspaper- and periodical-reported ghost stories from 19th-c. Britain, with a location-focus on London. While researching and using available newspaper and periodical databases, I discovered a field largely dominated by large databases (archives), which contain either scans of broadsheets or collected books. A researcher can expect to use finding aids, record and note-taking tools, powerful search and filtering, plus visualization within an archive. But if the finding aids and search cannot index on data that drives the research questions, one can expect to rely only on proxies for their interests. In a perfect world, the research questions could guide the research tools, not the other way around.  The project originated as a research station for an undergraduate thesis Locating Literature in the Ghost Hoax: an exploration of 19th-century print news media by Gabi Keane. Shortly after submission of the thesis, the project became a pedagogical tool for an National Endowment for the Humanities Institute for the Advancement of Digital Humanities grant application "Advanced digital editing". The version of the application that you're currently using represents the laboratory edition created in support of the grant; it also represents an expression of the research questions the author stated in the original thesis.  The idea of creating a dedicated project space for brief newspaper and periodical articles, collected by a common theme, is somewhat unusual among digital edition projects, as its subject matter tends to be based on manuscripts, like books, short stories, poems, or collected letters. These kinds of digital editions can privilege the [known] authors in a way that simply is not as useful in periodical studies, and thus many low-code publication tools did not account for some of the nuances of the corpus. With this project, we hope to model the way one may go about larger subject-focused periodical collections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ten years after Catherine II annexed Crimea, Russian imperial officials undertook a survey of some of the most valuable properties in the newly-acquired territory: its gardens. The survey focused on orchards and vineyards that had been abandoned by their owners (Tatars and Greeks) and claimed as state property. The work was carried out between 1791 and 1793 and this dataset presents the results. The data describes 809 orchards and 332 vineyards located mainly on the southern coast and along a trio of rivers flowing northwest out of the mountains. Location data is based on OpenStreetMap data (WGS84).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This dataset is sourced from an elegant deck of playing cards created in 1856 to teach members of Russia's elite families about the empire they inhabited. The cards—all 80 of them—provide us with a unique perspective on how the subjects of the tsar "saw" their country on the eve of the emancipation of the serfs. The resulting data includes hundreds of attributes describing the distribution of economic activities, ethnic groups, geographical features, and historical "particularities." The data is accompanied by a readme, a file catalog, a codebook, and a glossary. Spatial units: 3 semi-autonomous regions (polygons); 77 provinces (polygons); 417 towns (points); 180 rivers (lines)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the outcomes of the project was to preserve and digitize important, rare, and historical Japanese Brazilian newspapers. With guidance from the Hoover Institution Library &amp;amp; Archives, the Museu Histórico da Imigração Japonesa (the Historical Museum of Japanese Immigration) in São Paolo, Brazil, conserved and digitized their three major Japanese-language newspapers: the Notícias do Brasil (Burajiru Jiho), Nippak-Shimbun (Nippaku Shinbun), and Diário Nippak (Nippaku Mainichi Shinbun). After the Library &amp;amp; Archives completed describing the materials and creating the metadata, the newspapers were made available in the Hoji Shinbun Digital Collection, providing researchers around the world with access to more than 35,000 pages of new materials from Brazil.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Coles House, known officially as the Young Women's Boarding Home Association, arose from the 1891 merger of the Boarding Home for Young Women (1433 Lombard Street) and the Clinton Street Boarding home (913-915 Clinton Street). Both homes were founded by Mary Coles, the first in 1866 and the second in 1871, and intended to serve Protestant working girls of good moral character under the age of 26. Board charges were subsidized to make it more affordable. Shortly after the merger, the home at 1433 Lombard street was closed and sold. A property at 834 Pine Street was purchased in 1896 and operated until 1924. The remaining home on Clinton Street was named "Coles House" in honor of founder Mary Coles, who had died in 1920. Coles House was expanded to include the house at 917 Clinton Street in 1945 and 911 Clinton Street in 1965. Coles House (the Young Women's Boarding Home Association), including its earlier iterations, operated for over 135 years. The Clinton Street properties were sold in 2002, and proceeds were used to establish the Coles House Fund, a donor-advised fund administered by the Philadelphia Foundation. The collection includes minutes, correspondence, managers reports, resident records, annual reports, bank and payroll records, paid bills and petty cash receipts, and some photographs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Caroline Earle White, a Philadelphia activist, and about thirty other women founded the Women's Branch of the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (WPSPCA) in 1869 after White had been shut out of a leadership role of the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Originally, the WSPCA's purpose was to provide for the inspection of and care of working horses in Philadelphia, but the scope quickly expanded to include livestock and small animals. Despite the nominal designation as a branch of the Pennsylvania SPCA, the society was fully independent from the beginning, and White served as president until her death in 1916. The group promoted animal welfare through youth education and legislative reform, providing fountains and drinking stations for horses and cattle, and by addressing individual cases of cruelty. Now legally known as Women's Humane Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals the organization does business as the Women's Animal Center, continuing the work started in 1869. It is a member of the Philadelphia No-Kill coalition and operates out of Bensalem, Pennsylvania. The collection includes photographs, correspondence, annual reports, minutes, their publication ("The Guardian"), newspaper clippings, business records, and other printed matter. The collection spans 100 years of the organization's history, with material dating from the 1870s to the late 1970s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Society of Colonial Dames of America (CDA) was founded in New York in 1890 by May King Van Rensselaer, Elizabeth Coralie Gardiner, and Elizabeth Duer King. The CDA was created for patriotic women of colonial ancestry with the declared objectives to be the preservation and dissemination of Revolutionary and early Federal heritage. In Philadelphia, a group of women wanted to form a chapter in 1891, but this nascent chapter disbanded due to conflicts over the parent organization in New York's constitution. In 1895, a Philadelphia chapter was successfully established and designated Chapter II. In keeping with the CDA's mission of historic preservation, Chapter II occupied a series of historic houses throughout its existence starting with the Randolph Mansion (now Laurel Hill) and Lemon Hill Mansion. The collection includes organizational documents with extensive minutes, collections records and operational records,and papers related to the historic houses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Republican Women of Pennsylvania, Inc., was founded in Philadelphia in 1920 by a small group of civic-minded women who had worked on the Republican campaign for the presidential election. The foundational purpose of the organization was to educate women about political issues and encourage thoughtful political participation. The club was granted a charter by the state of Pennsylvania in 1922. Membership remained small but active in the early years, and the women were influential in bringing voting machines to the city of Philadelphia. In the years prior to World War II, the organization hosted distinguished political guests and organized political events, including three interstate Republican women's conferences and two mock Republican Conventions. In 1941, the group purchased a building at 250 South 16th Street to use as a clubhouse. After the war, membership increased dramatically. Children's groups were added in the 1960s, and a full calendar of social events coexisted with political activities. The women raised funds for charitable and political causes through the annual Holiday Market and other events. In 1978, the club received a federal exemption from income tax as a social club, which precluded donations to political campaigns. The group began a terminal decline in membership, mirroring the general decline of women's clubs in the United States. In 1993, the clubhouse was sold, and the group rented space from the Racquet Club of Philadelphia. In 1997, an agreement was made with the Union League and the Abraham Lincoln Foundation for the use of a suite until the group disbanded around 2014. The collection includes extensive administrative and financial records, as well as scrapbooks and photographs documenting the club's activities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Filson Historical Society has re-launched the First American West, an online collection of letters, financial records, sermons, books, maps, and objects relating to the Ohio River Valley in the mid-1700s through the early 1800s, that was originally a collaboration with the Library of Congress and the University of Chicago. In our relaunch, an NEH-funded research team has expanded the project to highlight the experiences of those originally excluded, including the voices of women, those enslaved, and the Indigenous communities that called our region home.  On this site, you can browse the vast collection of documents by theme, subject, or item type. You can also explore themes and learn more about the project through the digital exhibit Encountering the First American West: 1750-1820.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project focuses on initial documentation of Leukon, an endangered language of Simeulue island, Aceh Province, Indonesia. Leukon is spoken in just two villages on Simeulue island and is increasingly threatened due to rapid development and increased reliance on Indonesian and the local lingua franca, Aneuk Jamee. There is almost no prior literature on Leukon, and very little on the neighboring (likely related) languages, Sigulai, Devayan, Haloban, and Nias. This project will produce audiovisual documentation of Leukon, focusing on traditional work as a culturally important part of their indigenous knowledge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From the date of the very first burial at The Green-Wood Cemetery in 1840 up until 1937, handwritten burial ledgers were maintained in the Cemetery offices. These oversized, clothbound books—known as the Burial Registry—list every interment at the Cemetery, chronologically. (Longtime Green-Wood staff still refer to these ledgers as "Chrono Books.") Each record, written in one long row that stretches across two pages, contains demographic information on the person being interred organized in twelve separate columns. In an effort to modernize its operations, Green-Wood stopped writing these records by hand in 1937 and turned to typewritten forms instead. These new forms included fewer points of information on each burial.   Green-Wood staff suspected that the information in the Burial Registry could be of great interest to researchers. To confirm that theory,  a panel of scholars reviewed the entirety of Green-Wood's institutional records—over 3,300 cubic feet. A planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) funded the work. The scholars nominated the Burial Registry as the top priority for digitization. In 2020, Green-Wood received a second grant from the NEH to transcribe every burial record in the series. The funds also covered the development of an Elasticsearch index that enables the burial record data to be discoverable and searchable to experienced researchers and to the general public.   The Burial Registry forms the basis for all the information in this database. In total, the record series consists of sixty handwritten ledger books with data pertaining to 438,180 individuals interred at the Cemetery between 1840 and 1937. Cemetery administrators meticulously recorded a number of data points for each individual.

		<Abstract>Set out in 1640, two Tunxis reservations on both sides of the Tunxis-Sepos River in Farmington, Connecticut were among the earliest established in America. However, by early 19th Century, the tribe and its tenure of communal and private properties had been transformed.  To more fully understand parts of Farmington as a distinctly Indigenous place for over 180 years, users can explore the theme of A More Perfect Union through the lens of land transfers by the Tunxis as individuals and as a communal entity.  The deeds often contain land coordinates, information about neighboring parcels, genealogical connections, and reasons why the land was sold.    Available for tribal, scholarly, educational and public use are 115 freely-accessible images, two forms of transcriptions, metadata, interactive biographies and annotations.  Scholars from two Tribal Nations reviewed content, worked collaboratively with project editors in the editorial process, and added tribal knowledge and commentaries.  In doing this, project editors expect to bring marginalized perspectives to the center about Indigenous land possession, dispossession, community, assimilation, migration, sovereignty, and individual expressions of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness through land ownership and tribal community.   We have also created digital humanities tools to enhance learning and promote awareness of an Indigenized landscape.  By plotting coordinates of the Tunxis land collection whenever possible, we created an interactive digital map that displays the Native land parcels on the Farmington landscape, provides information about the land and its grantors and grantees, and chronicles changes in Tunxis land ownership on and around the reservation.  By presenting the land records chronologically with other Tunxis community records already in the Portal, the creation of a more comprehensive timeline provides more context for understanding the Tunxis as a vibrant, responsive, and sovereign people.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This grant was used to produce a seminar series, entitled Community Matters, hosted by WTJX/NPR in the Virgin Islands, and curated by St. Jan Co Dr. Hadiya Sewer. Those recorded broadcasts served as community engagement events where critical discussions were held on topics pertaining to cultural preservation and the challenges that academics, artisans, educators and citizens face on St. John, and in the Virgin Islands, as a result of, or in relation to, cultural tourism. The second part of the grant was used to fund the production of an audio tour of places on St. John, and in Virgin Islands National Park, as told by St. Johnians and Park Rangers. This piece serves as a timeless self-guided interpretative tool that will be shared with park visitors in the Visitors Center, on the Friends website, and with schools (along with a resource guide of activities for educators).</Abstract>
