11221,FB-57108-13,"Hundreds of cartographic images of the world and its regions exist scattered throughout collections of medieval and early modern Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts. The sheer number of these extant maps tells us that from the thirteenth century onward, when these map-manuscripts began to proliferate, visually depicting the world became a major preoccupation of medieval Muslim scholars. However, these cartographers did not strive for mimesis, that is, representation or imitation of the real world. These schematic, geometric, and often symmetrical images of the world are iconographic representations—‘carto-ideographs'—of how medieval Muslim cartographic artists and their patrons perceived their world and chose to represent and disseminate this perception. In this podcast, we sit down with Karen Pinto to discuss the maps found in the cartographically illustrated Kitab al-Masalik wa-al-Mamalik (Book of Routes and Realms) tradition, which is the first known geographic atlas of maps, its influence on Ottoman cartography, and how basic versions of these carto-ideographs were transported back to villages and far-flung areas of the Islamic empire.",OA,2016,Nir Shafir,Web,http://http://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2016/01/islamic-cartography.html,,Chris Gratien,,,Mapping the Medieval World in Islamic Cartography,Karen Pinto

In this episode, we speak to Nükhet Varlik, author of Plague and Empire in the Early Modern Mediterranean World:  the Ottoman experience, 1347-1600 (Cambridge University Press), about how genetic evidence has transformed the study of the plague in the past ten years, allowing geneticists to more readily identify the presence of Yersinia pestis bacteria in human remains.  Whereas before historians had been hesitant to diagnose diseases posthumously, they can now speak with greater certainty about the presence of plague.  We then discuss the life of plague in the early modern Ottoman Empire in particular, focusing on the creation of ‘plague capitals' in the urban centers of the Ottoman Empire following the conquest of Constantinople and how integrating the Ottoman experience of plague changes the story of how historians of medicine approach the topic.  To inspire future collaborations among our listeners, we end with a peek at the process of working with geneticists and what such approaches can contribute to the study of the history of the Middle East.",open access on-line,2016,Nir Shafir,Web,http://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2016/07/plague.html,podcast link,Ottoman History Podcast,,,Ottoman History Podcast Episode 252:  Tracing Plague in the Ottoman Empire,Nukhet Varlik

12278,AQ-234985-16,"Do we have a soul? Is it material, like air, or immaterial, like a shadow? Are souls feminine and masculine or do they remove their gender as they exit the body? If souls resemble the body, can they be, say, blue-eyed, or blind, or white, or black? Are there infant souls in the afterworld? Do they grow up? When we sleep, does the soul leave the body to enter into an otherworldly order that we experience as a dream? Can it be trapped there, to be sold on the black market? Where does it go after death? To the bush, the domain of spirits? To the underworld, where it loses its memory? Is there a place reserved for the souls of soldiers and one for those of philosophers? Can the soul be tortured? Are stars souls? Is the soul a bird?&#x0D; &#x0D; Questions and beliefs like these have marked people's identities, influenced how we see others, and how we divide the world. Spanish colonists, for instance, often thought that ""Indians"" did not have a soul, which partly explains the savagery of the colonial process. In the West, a body/soul rhetoric has evolved along with features of our civilization, a process that has marked, in particular, the humanities and the arts. (Why is medieval plainchant, for example, devoid of beat? Because beat, the clergy argued, leaps to the feet and to the hip to pollute the soul.) Changes in beliefs about the soul have also marked how we perceive reality, and even how we experience our body. Consider sexuality, for instance, an embodied experience historically regarded as a threat to the soul.&#x0D; &#x0D; The world has seen age-old battles for the control of this body/soul rhetoric; battles that, still waged today, need our attention because they ultimately are about the social construction of reality and of features of civilization itself.",,2017,Rafael F.

18500,RA-50142-14,"Séances, clairvoyance, and telepathy captivated public imagination in the United States from the 1850s well into the twentieth century. Though skeptics dismissed these experiences as delusions, a new kind of investigator emerged to seek the science behind such phenomena. With new technologies like the telegraph collapsing the boundaries of time and space, an explanation seemed within reach. As Americans took up psychical experiments in their homes, the boundaries of the mind began to waver. Common Phantoms: An American History of Psychic Science (Stanford UP, 2020) brings these experiments back to life while modeling a new approach to the history of psychology and the mind sciences.  Drawing on previously untapped archives of participant-reported data, Alicia Puglionesi recounts how an eclectic group of investigators tried to capture the most elusive dimensions of human consciousness. A vast though flawed experiment in democratic science, psychical research gave participants valuable tools with which to study their experiences on their own terms. Academic psychology would ultimately disown this effort as both a scientific failure and a remnant of magical thinking, but its challenge to the limits of science, the mind, and the soul still reverberates today.

19753,TR-261123-18,"Most accounts of the collapse of Richard Nixon's presidency begin with Watergate — the now iconic tale of a bungled break-in and the misbegotten cover-up that followed.  But what led to Watergate?  How — and more puzzlingly, why — did one of the shrewdest, most gifted political figures of his time become embroiled in so manifestly lunatic an enterprise in the first place?  Intrigued by that question, writer/journalist Kurt Andersen takes a deep dive into the vast archives at the Nixon Library and emerges with an answer he wasn't expecting: While Watergate doubtless accelerated Nixon's spectacular fall, it was the Vietnam War that led inexorably to the break-in, and from there to the sinking of his presidency.  For Andersen, who came of age in the Vietnam era, that answer in turn begs another, larger question: How did Richard Nixon, with all his foreign policy savvy, allow himself to get trapped in the same quagmire he had watched engulf his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson? These questions are the central concerns of Nixon at War.

Sarah Schneewind argues that the institution could invite and pressure officials to serve local interests; the policies that had earned a man commemoration were carved into stone beside the shrine. Since everyone recognized that elite men might honor living officials just to further their own careers, pre-mortem shrine rhetoric stressed the role of commoners, who embraced the opportunity by initiating many living shrines. This legitimate, institutionalized political voice for commoners expands a scholarly understanding of ""public opinion"" in late imperial China, aligning it with the efficacy of deities to create a nascent political conception Schneewind calls the ""minor Mandate of Heaven."" Her exploration of pre-mortem shrine theory and practice illuminates Ming thought and politics, including the Donglin Party's battle with eunuch dictator Wei Zhongxian and Gu Yanwu's theories.",,2019,"Michael Laha of China File, Asia Society",Web,http://https://www.chinafile.com/library/books/shrines-living-men-ming-political-cosmos,,,,,Shrines to Living Men in the Ming Political Cosmos,Michael Laha
20556,FA-56424-12,"What recourse did you have in Ming China if your very excellent local official was leaving your area and moving on to a new jurisdiction? You could try to block his path, you could wail and tear your hair out – or you could house an image of him in a temple, make offerings before it, and create a ‘living shrine.' In Shrines to Living Men in the Ming Political Cosmos (Harvard University Asia Center, 2018), Sarah Schneewind explores every angle of this practice, covering everything from what living shrines looked like and how many there were, to how they functioned as both expressions of gratitude and (more importantly) ways through which Ming subjects could speak out publicly. Beautifully written and elegantly built, this book not only tells you everything you never knew you wanted to know about living shrines, it makes reading about them a joy.",,2020,Sarah Bramao-Ramos of New Books in East Asian Studies,Web,http://https://newbooksnetwork.com/sarah-schneewind-shrines-to-living-men-in-the-ming-political-cosmos-harvard-asia-center-2018,,,,,Shrines to Living Men in the Ming Political Cosmos,

To accomplish this we spoke to a broad range of guests that included historians, politicians, lawyers, Tupperware saleswomen, and highschool activists. In all, sixteen guests joined us in season two and represented a diversity of age, race, gender and plastics expertise/background that aligns with the ubiquitous story of plastics.

Tens of thousands were paralyzed when the virus attacked their nervous systems. Many were left unable to walk. In the worst cases, people's breathing muscles stopped working, and they were placed in an iron lung, a giant ventilator that fits the human body from the neck down.  On June 8, 1953, five-year-old Martha Lillard contracted polio. She spent six months in the hospital, where she was put in a ventilator called an iron lung to help her breathe. A polio vaccine became widely available in 1955 — and millions of Americans got vaccinated. The iron lung became obsolete and they stopped being manufactured in the late 1960's. While many people who suffered from polio or post-polio syndrome either weaned themselves off the machines or switched to another form of ventilator, Martha never did. To this day, she is one of only two people in the United States who still depends on the iron lung to survive.",,2021,,"Radio, Digital File, Web",https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1047691984/decades-after-polio-martha-is-among-the-last-to-still-rely-on-an-iron-lung-to-br,The NPR webpage where the broadcast story and the companion web article appeared.,"Alissa Escarce, Erin Kelly, Joe Richman",https://www.radiodiaries.org/my-iron-lung/,The Radio Diaries webpage where the podcast episode appeared.,My Iron Lung,"Erin Kelly, Alissa Escarce"

The smallpox vaccine—the world's very first vaccine—was invented by Edward Jenner in the 1700s. Almost two hundred years later, public health workers from around the world came together to try to eliminate the virus. American public health worker Alan Schnur and French doctor Daniel Tarantola were among them.

22888,FEL-273424-21,"In this podcast we bring together questions of sound and questions of justice. Debates about justice are one way that people address resource scarcity, violence, and community survival. ""Justice"" is a broad category that can evoke competing visions; it is mediated by concepts, social structures, and relations. Here we explore how it is mediated by sound, such as the qualities of a voice, authoritative speech, songs of solidarity, or the noise of protests. Distinctions between sounds, such as ""voice"" and ""noise,"" are in turn mediated by ideologies that connect sound to socio-political dynamics. Soundshapes how people know, experience or engage justice, just as ideas about justice orient people to sound . We ask: how does sound ground or undermine prevailing approaches to 'justice'? How does sound offer novel ways to contest or reimagine what constitutes justice? In short, what does justice sound like?  Reflecting on the mediating relations between sound and justice, this podcast tells the stories of sonic objects. These include: the circulation of an anthem during protests against citizenship laws in India; judges' masculine registers in sexual assault sentencing hearings in Milwaukee, WI; the acoustic dimensions of the ‘field' in the work of human rights and humanitarian aid interpreters; the role of a theme song in addressing strategic dilemmas in marijuana legalization campaigns; and the affective qualities of participants' voices in ""successful"" restorative justice circles. Drawing on the capacity of the podcast to incorporate sound, we interrogate and interpret the sensory experiences of justice and the communicative practices on which imaginings of justice depend.

In addition to this contribution to the study of Japanese empire, Imperial Gateway highlights two aspects of the history that are often underappreciated in the Anglophone literature. First, Shirane expands the aperture of his narrative beyond bilateral Sino-Japanese relations to encompass a dynamic multilateral milieu that includes colonial Taiwan, the region's Western powers, and the Taiwanese subjects of the empire called ""overseas Taiwanese"" (sekimin) by Japan. Second, Shirane pays particular attention to the agency not just of the Government-General installed by Japan to rule over Taiwan, but also the ""overseas Taiwanese"" both wooed by the Japanese to advance imperial ambitions and also pursuing their own autonomous interests.

23663,ZB-250690-16,"Episode 19: Robert Chase. In this episode, Siobhan talks with Robert Chase about his book, We Are Not Slaves: State Violence, Coerced Labor, and Prisoners' Rights in Postwar America (University of North Carolina Press, 2020). Chase is Associate Professor of History at Stony Brook University. In We Are Not Slaves Chase draws from three decades of legal documents compiled by prisoners to narrate the struggle to change prison from within. Told from the vantage point of the prisoners themselves, this book weaves together untold but devastatingly important truths from the histories of labor, civil rights, and politics in the United States as it narrates the transition from prison plantations of the past to the mass incarceration of today. This episode is part of a series featuring legal history works from UNC Press.
