		<Abstract>Food is a marker of identity, culture, and class, and it denotes power, routine, leisure, and celebration. Despite its importance to every aspect of historical research, this topic has not been sufficiently explored in Ottoman history. This volume places the study of food in the mainstream of Ottoman history by analizing major issues--origins, identity, minorities, Ottomanization, the "golden age," foreign relations, the nature of modernity-- all from the perspective of food.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Redford considers the coincidence, or lack thereof, of states and markets.  He finds that the founding of the Principality of Antioch on the model of the Byzantine Duchy of Antioch led to a geographical, administrative, and economic imbalance.  Geography linked the city of Antioch and its hinterland more closely with the Cilician plain/Cukurova to the north, but the principality's major port, Laodikeia/al-Ladhaqiyya/Lattakia/Lazkiye, and all of its territory to the south along the northern Syrian coast lay apart.  This disjunction between geography and polity had important implications for the economy of the region and the nature of the principality, as an examination of the archazeological evidence suggests.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Vasco da Gama's successful voyage around the Cape of Good Hope in 1497 and the foundation of the Portuguese Estado da India in the following decades has long been identified as a development of enormous global significance, marking as it did the beginning of direct and continuous contact between the civilizations of Western Europe and the Indian Ocean.  Much less well known to modern scholarship, by contrast, is the rival and contemporaneous expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the lands of the Indian Ocean littoral, a process which began with Sultan Selim I's conquest of Egypt in 1517, and which would continue throughout the rest of the sixteenth century.  Because the Ottoman state and the merchant communities of the Indian Ocean shared the same religion, most modern scholars have simply assume that they enjoyed a kind of de facto familiarity with one another as well.   In reality, the early sixteenth century Ottomans were in many ways even less aware of the geography, history and civilization of the Indian Ocean than were their contemporary Portuguese rivals.  The subsequent development of direct contact between the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim principalities and trading communities of the Indian Ocean thus represents a kind of Ottoman 'discovery' of an entirely new part of the globe, and one which corresponds in many ways to the much better documented European discoveries of the same period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Study of music and lyrics of different song types shows that the Athabascan language spoken in Minto, Alaska, differs in spoken and sung contexts.  Specifically, unusual words are used, referred to as ‘high language'. Poetic and elliptical language is also found. Important words are sung first, and may be augmented with vocables to show their importance. Voice quality is used to show emotion and to keep the beat in memorial songs. Glottal stops may be unrealized.   Verb stem prominence is reflected when lyrics are matched to tune, may be highlighted with high pitch or pitch change (memorial verses) When music and words conflict in pitch or duration, musical values tend to dominate.  When songs are translated from English to Minto, music still dominates, along with traditional values in content.   </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The excavations on the Kastro, in the northeastern Isthmus of Ierapetra near Kavousi, have revealed remains from a substantial phase of settlement belonging to the Late Geometric period. This settlement is composed primarily of multi-room houses built on naturally and artificially terraced slopes. House sizes and plans vary widely across the site: some structures were new foundations in Late Geometric, while others were established in the Protogeometric period and continued to be used, usually with some modification. This paper 1) identifies the Late Geometric houses and exterior spaces; 2) examines other structures whose function may not have been primarily domestic; 3) assesses the factors that may have impacted the plans, sizes and locations of buildings in the settlement; and 4) suggests access routes through the settlement. Explication of the Late Geometric settlement on the Kastro will reveal aspects of social organization and enhance our understanding of conditions that contributed to the process of urbanization on Crete.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper presents the goals and results of excavations at the Early Iron Age and Archaic site of Azoria in northeastern Crete. Recent excavations at the site (2002-2006) demonstrate that the seventh century B.C. was an important period of culture change in which the Early Iron Age landscape was substantially transformed. The formalization of civic architecture and the reorganization of civic and domestic space are linked to the changing economics of food provisioning in the civic sphere and differentiation of processing and consumption patterns in various domestic and civic contexts. Public places such as an andreion, temple, and an early civic banquet hall were communal, but each was also to some degree exclusionary, serving to order the status of households and clans, and modes of social interaction. New civic buildings seem to form new contexts for elite consumption, negotiating political power, and asserting or claiming social identity in the early city. The paper focuses on the diachronic changes in the formal structure of the site, economic systems, and social organization from the Early Iron Age until the establishment of the city in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C.   </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter focuses on what it means to be a male elite mestizo by tracing the parallel social networks (Spanish elite, indigenous or mestizo plebeians) along which mestizos traced their social interactions. While female elite mestizos were able to marry Spanish men, ensuring that their offspring were identified as Spaniards, their brothers could not, resulting in elite social networks in their public lives and plebeian networks in their private lives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay examines the mechanisms by which Brahmanical tradition reproduced itself, especially the regimens of discipline (vratas) undertaken in tandem with text-study, and their role in establishing the knowledge of Sanskrit religious texts (and the use of Sanskrit more broadly) as an important criterion of piety and high social status. I argue that such regimens functioned as markers of belonging to the Brahmanical religion and ‘pure' Årya society, while also offering the ordinary householder a form of personal piety that promised all the rewards of the old priestly ‘high cult. At the same time, disciplinary regimens provided a traditionally recognized framework for mendicant movements and new deity cults, which helped carry Brahmanical texts, ideals, and practices, via royal patronage, into new regions in India beyond the Ganges Valley and on into Southeast Asia. The second part of this essay will consider what early inscriptions can show us about how Brahmanical doctrine and practice were projected in the public sphere, noting instances in which particular subjects, texts, and especially disciplinary practices are cited, and observing that the grants and foundations recorded in these inscriptions helped spread the tradition and enhance its prestige. My remarks, intended only as a point of departure, will focus mainly on early grants from Orissa.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter from the edited volume analyzes the linked histories of two adjacent neighborhoods, one a favela—the Morro dos Cabritos—and the other a middle-class residential neighborhood—Bairro Peixoto. This is the most harmonious case of formal/informal relations in Rio de Janeiro—all similar pairs of neighborhoods have suffered greater violence and animosity. But even this relatively harmonious case reveals the adversarial dynamics that have shaped the city over the past forty years. The individual book manuscript analyzes the larger city, concentrating in greater depth on redemocratization from 1977-1993. This draft chapter begins with a description of present-day Morro dos Cabritos and Bairro Peixoto, then analyzes the shared history that has brought them to this point.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nearly two decades ago, Patrick Olivelle drew attention to the fact that, with the emergence and general acceptance of the classical 'asrama system', the status of the snataka (one who has taken the ritual bath that concludes studentship), was eclipsed. Although in Vedic times he was held up as an object of reverence, he ran the risk in later times of being condemned as an anasramin (one without an asrama; hence, a sinner) (Olivelle 1993: 220-221). This paper will examine the ritual and social roles of the snataka, with special attention to later works of the Grhya ritual literature, including the Baudhayanagrhyaparibhasasutra.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Designed as a corrective to colonial literary histories that have excluded Native voices, this anthology brings together a variety of primary texts produced by the Algonquian peoples of New England during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and very early nineteenth centuries. Included among these written materials and objects are letters, signatures, journals, baskets, pictographs, confessions, wills, and petitions, each of which represents a form of authorship. Together they demonstrate the continuing use of traditional forms of memory and communication and the lively engagement of Native peoples with alphabetic literacy during the colonial period. Each primary text is accompanied by an essay that places it in context and explores its significance. Written by leading scholars in the field, these readings draw on recent trends in literary analysis, history, and anthropology to provide an excellent overview of the field of early Native studies. They are also intended to provoke discussion and open avenues for further exploration by students and other interested readers. Above all, the texts and commentaries gathered in this volume provide an opportunity to see Native American literature as a continuity of expression that reflects choices made long before contact and colonization, rather than as a nineteenth- or even twentieth-century invention.  Contributors include Heidi Bohaker, Heather Bouwman, Joanna Brooks, Kristina Bross, Stephanie Fitzgerald, Sandra Gustafson, Laura Arnold Leibman, Kevin McBride, David Murray, Laura Murray, Jean O Brien, Ann Marie Plane, Philip Round, Jodi Schorb, David Silverman, and Hilary E. Wyss. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Analysis of American writer Margaret Fuller's reading notes on the novels of French writer George Sand, as well as Fuller's published comments about Sand.  The article's argument is that Sand prompted Fuller to think about how she might write in Sand's mode (quite different from her own) and that a Fuller sketch, "The Magnolia of Lake Pontchartrain," is evidence for this influence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Joachim von Sandrart was the most important German painter and theoretician in the second half of the 17th century.

		<Abstract>In the past several years it has become imperative to bring the research agendas of the humanities and computer science together to advance our abilities for representing, editing, and accessing our cultural records. What is urgently needed to take full advantage of encoding schemes of scholarly editions is the seamless integration of text and image, which will ultimately serve the interests of not only image-based scholarly editions but also the broader cultural world. The Computer Science research community is very interested in image search and techniques for developing efficient and accurate searching, while the humanities computing research community is similarly absorbed in textual encoding. Neither area is likely to make real progress, however, until their complementary research agendas converge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>John Durang was the first American-born theater professional to make the stage his life. Durang was born on January 6, 1768, shortly after his parents' emigration to Pennsylvania from the Alsace in France. Durang's career as a theater professional unfolded primarily in Philadelphia, then America's major city.  His movement work encompassed the popular dances of theatrical interludes , ballets, pantomimes, and circus acts.   Remarkably for an actor of this period, Durang also wrote a Memoir, held at the York County Heritage Trust, and published in 1966. It includes Durang's memories of his life and career, "day books" of his work as a manager in the latter part of his career, and – of most interest to us for this project – a set of 8 watercolors by Durang himself. Six of his illustrations are self-portraits in performance. The following is a list of the images he included of his dancing roles: 1.John Durang in character of the Dwarf Metamorphosed. 2.John Durang in character of a Hornpipe. 3.John Durang in character of the Dutch Fisherman. 4.John Durang in character of a Highland Fling — Ballet of Auld Robin Gray. 5.John Durang in character of Harlequin, Animation scene, in five positions. 6.John Durang in character of a Pas seul à Vestris. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this chapter, I analyze accounts of the Mughal Emperor Akbar's interaction with yogis, especially at the Balnath Tilla in what is now Pakistan.  Several of the accounts were previously untranslated--some from Hindi oral tradition and one from Portuguese.  These accounts confirm that the emperor Akbar (d. 1605) was fascinated by yogis and their practices and beliefs.  I argue that these accounts should be understood in terms of the emerging Mughal imperialism of the time, which involved a process of mutual incorporation--a 'taking possession' of both territory and persons, by the emperor from above and the yogis from below--as each side 'domesticated' the other.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this essay, I examine the life, death, and afterlife of Francis Xavier--especially the politics surrounding his eventual canonization in 1623--in order to explore the degree to which early-modern Iberian imperialism was a complex and multi-centered global organism.  I argue that the history of Xavier's canonization demonstrates a 'counterflow' of imperialism whereby institutional developments in Rome and Lisbon depended on the flow of ideas and testimony about Xavier from the social and geographical margins of Empire--from low-caste Christians from the 'Pearl Fishery Coast' of South India, and from the mixed-race denizens of Goa.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter explores the overlapping ground of slavery and discipleship in South Asia as a problem of theory as well as practice.  With respect to theory, it probes the social dynamics (especially ‘marginal kinship' and ‘social death') that account for slavery's utility for asceticism.  With respect to practice, the chapter examines the presence—and, for the British, the problem—of slave-disciples in the ‘warrior ascetic' armies that operated across northern India in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, both against and alongside Company forces.  The chapter concludes with an analysis of the Mughal emperor Akbar's late sixteenth-century anxieties about the shared meanings of slavery and discipleship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this chapter, I examine an outbreak of violence in Banaras in 1809 that is often remembered as the city's first 'communal riot'.  Of particular interest is the central role of 'gosains' (Saiva ascetics) in the violence.  I argue that the gosains involvement in the violence was connected to the termination of gosain military service in the neighboring region of Bundelkhand between 1806 and 1809.  The involvement of gosains in the violence was also significant insofar as it marks the rising profile of Vaishnava bhakti among heretofore Saiva gosains.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay argues that the Chinese shop is a key economic and social structure for understanding the Chinese Caribbean experience.  The essay also argues that the shop is a particularly apt metaphor for the kinds of cultural encounters that define Chinese Caribbean identity and experience.  For example, the counter—which is, in many ways, the focal point and central feature of the shop—functions both as a border that separates and distinguishes one culture from another as well as a mechanism which facilitates cultural and economic exchanges.  The essay examines the representation of the Chinese shop as it appears in a range of literary texts, including the poetry of Easton Lee and The Pagoda by Patricia Powell.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>John Ashbery's (1956) poem, "Le Livre Est Sur La Table," is resonant (in one sense of the word) of Wordsworth's solitary reaper, although it also echoes—or resonates with—Wallace Stevens's figure of a woman singing by the sea in "The Idea of Order at Key West."  Certainly Ashbery draws on Wordsworth's nightingale and Cuckoo bird breaking "the silence of the seas." As his title suggests, the book Ashbery puts on our table is in part a volume of Wordsworth's poems, but translated, with a new grammar, that of mid-twentieth-century American poetry.  Moreover, the resonance set up by Ashbery's and Stevens's repetitions of Wordsworth's haunting lyric is recast yet again in Adrienne Rich's (1973) "Blood-Sister."  The chapter traces how poems work differently in different contexts, but add that an awareness of this can be seen as an integral part of Wordsworth's legacy, which persist, if with salient differences, for reasons that can be discussed in both poetic and sociological contexts, in the twentieth-century American lyric.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The chapter argues that William Carlos Williams's poetics and his use of the image are indebted to practices found in Wordsworth.  Williams, in turn, is claimed by later American poets from Philip Levine to Lorine Niedecker whose practices seem starkly opposed to one another.  The primary argument is that current ways of distinguishing so-called mainstream work (often associated with Romantic poetry and lyricism) from so-called experimental work (often self-described as anti-Romantic) in the U.S. are not ultimately useful, in part because literary genealogies are complex and shift over time or between cultures.  In particular, past poetry (here, primarily, Wordsworth's and Williams's) is re-read in different ways by different reading communities.  Nonetheless, a surprisingly wide range of apparently opposed poetic camps in the U.S. defend poetry in ways familiar to anyone who works on the Romantics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, I argue that cosmopolitics, of which indigenous activism is one form, must take seriously the mediating role of the state and the pressures of neoliberalism in shaping political positionings and possibilities. The paper uses an ethnohistorical case study of Maasai activists in Tanzania to explore the centrality of the state to both indigenous rights and neoliberalism, and the consequent challenges to the political struggles of historically marginalized peoples.  It traces and explains three phases of the relationship between Maasai and the Tanzanian state: 1) a deeply modernist, paternalist postcolonial state that treated Maasai as "subjects" rather than "citizens," and left little space for Maasai political engagement;  2) the emergence and embrace of indigenous rights and international advocacy by Maasai activists in the 1990s, and 3) a recent shift by Maasai activists from discourses of indigeneity to discourses of livelihoods, and from international to national advocacy.  These shifting political strategies and positionings within international and national debates inform, challenge, and complicate ongoing theoretical and political debates about the struggles of transnational social movements, the contours of cosmopolitics, and the enduring political salience of the state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay represents a succinct overview of Russia's religious history over the last 300 years (since the beginning of the reign of Peter the Great). Instead of focusing exclusively on Orthodox Christianity, Russia's principal religion, the essay discusses all of the major confessional groups in Russia, including Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Protestantism, and Catholicism. It represent one of six essays on the "Fundamentals of Russian History" in the Oxford Handbook of Modern Russian History.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Movement coalitions and states are important elements in our social movement conceptual repertoire.  But the two are seldom examined relationally, as movement-state coalitions.  Attention to countermovement-state coalitions is even more rare.  This paper contributes to filling this latter void by illuminating a particular type of countermovement-state coalition formation process: business leaders who formed their own private militias and entered into coalitions with local governments to suppress the nascent labor movement during the late 19th-century.  Examining primary and secondary evidence for several northern industrial cities during this period, I ask several key questions: How did these militias form and become allied with municipal authorities?  What were the major conditions that contributed to these coalition formations?  What sort of historical trajectory did these coalitions follow?  Answers to these questions inform our understanding of elite countermovement-state coalition processes and how private employers and state authorities often worked in tandem in the policing of labor during its early phases as a challenging movement.  The findings have important implications generally for relations between movements and institutionalized politics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay argues that there was a complex historical relationship between the new leisure economy and the transformation of urban space in the years before the modern environmental movement, one that encompassed more than debates over wilderness protection and access to public lands.  In Seattle, this history began with the rapid physical growth of the city at the turn of the twentieth century.  Redirecting rivers, filling estuaries, and building parks completely reworked the landscapes of the city and its environs for the benefit of middle-class outdoor recreation.  The production of these new spaces from the late 1890s to the Great Depression generated a new geography of leisure for middle-class Seattleites.   Remaking urban space became a process, both material and symbolic, that not only enhanced nature but also enriched society by promoting consumption.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For more than a century and a half, disputes over salmon have figured into almost every debate in and around Seattle over how to balance society and environment.  A century ago, the terms of the debate revolved around improving nature to improve society by redirecting rivers, leveling hills, filling estuaries, and luring industry.  By millennium's end, restoring nature propelled discussions over redefining human community.  The story of Seattle's salmon suggests a more complicated view of how history, human and non-human, creates and splinters the idea of community through time.  Paying attention to the persistence of the past can suggest how, if Seattleites think historically, they might be able to rebuild a city that is home to salmon and  people, too.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection of original essays explores the tensions between prevailing regional and national versions of Indigenous pasts created, reified, and disseminated through monuments, and Indigenous peoples' memories and experiences of place. The contributors ask critical questions about historic preservation and commemoration methods used by modern societies and their impact on the perception and identity of the people they supposedly remember, who are generally not consulted in the commemoration process. They discuss dichotomies of history and memory, place and displacement, public spectacle and private engagement, and reconciliation and re-appropriation of the heritage of indigenous people shown in these monuments. While the case studies deal with North American indigenous experience—from California to Virginia, and from the Southwest to New England and the Canadian Maritime—they have implications for dealings between indigenous peoples and nation states worldwide.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Patients as Policy Actors offers groundbreaking accounts of one of the health field's most important developments of the last fifty years--the rise of more consciously patient-centered care and policymaking. The authors in this volume illustrate, from multiple disciplinary perspectives, the unexpected ways that patients can matter as both agents and objects of health care policy yet nonetheless too often remain silent, silenced, misrepresented, or ignored. The volume concludes with a unique epilogue outlining principles for more effectively integrating patient perspectives into a pluralistic conception of policy-making. With the recent enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, patients' and consumers' roles in American health care require more than ever the careful analysis and attention exemplified by this innovative volume.  </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ripoll 106 is one of the oldest manuscripts in the Archive of the Crown of Aragon (Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó, or ACA) in Barcelona, one that deserves to be more widely known than it is.  While the later medieval Crown of Aragon, which consisted of Catalonia and surrounding regions, is known for its wealth of documentary evidence, Anglophone scholars have just recently begun to explore the archive's possibilities for earlier ages.  The region possessed a religious diversity that is by now well known.   In the last ten years studies in English have moved the chronological horizon back to the tenth century, and even the ninth, but still focus on the mundane matters recorded in charters.   Manuscript evidence of the learned culture of monastic and cathedral schools is still relatively unknown to the readers of this recent literature, despite what it has to reveal about relationships between Christians and Jews in the ninth-century Spanish March.  Ripoll 106 provides valuable clues about exactly this issue, the religious diversity of the March and what Christian educators thought about it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper describes the development, composition, and several uses of the Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebanks, large collections of Classical texts in which the syntactic, morphological and lexical information for each word is made explicit. To date, over 200 individuals from around the world have collaborated to annotate over 350,000 words, including the entirety of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Sophocles' Ajax, all of the extant works of Hesiod and Aeschylus, and selections from Caesar, Cicero, Jerome, Ovid, Petronius, Propertius, Sallust and Vergil. While perhaps the most straightforward value of such an annotated corpus for Classical philology is the morphosyntactic searching it makes possible, it also enables a large number of downstream tasks as well, such as inducing the syntactic behavior of lexemes and automatically identifying similar passages between texts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I discuss two kinds of ontological debates: about identity and persistence conditions, and about existence.

		<Abstract>2009 marked the tenth anniversary since the inception of our online project, the Decameron Web, (www.brown.edu/decameron), a hypertextual web archive designed to promote the knowledge and teaching of a Medieval Italian classic, Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron. Sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, with two grants in the Education and Technology programs (1999-2000 and 2002-03), the DW is now part of the Virtual Humanities Lab and is well established as a reliable online resource for teachers, students and general readers, interested in exploring this book in electronic form, in its original language and in translation. It features a modular encyclopedic apparatus, built collaboratively by scholars, teachers and students, and including a pedagogy module for the benefit of teachers and students alike. In this paper, after describing the original features and the various stages in the design, construction and development of this resource, the authors reflect upon the ten years of its existence: the challenges they have faced in building it and keeping it up to date; the response they have received from the academic community and the public at large; the feedback created by its use, inside and outside the classroom. They also focus on other  theoretical issues for any project of this kind, which emphasizes the independent learning process and the "exploration" of a text within a body of materials designed to facilitate the students' own comprehension of the interrelation of literature and other areas of human endeavor. A section of this paper is focused on what worked well and what didn't over the first decade of the project's existence, including such issues as teacher participation and scholar collaboration, the evaluation process, issues of copyright and fair practices etc.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents the Virtual Humanities Lab as a potential platform for collaborative electronic editions and interactive digital library collections. It also introduces an exciting new project, then in its early stages, conceived in partnership with the Center for Digital Initiatives of the Brown Library, focused on one of the finest surviving examples of panoramic art: a mid-19th-century, 273-foot long, double-sided painting depicting the life story of Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi. (This is also a timely project, since 2007 is the bicentennial of Garibaldi's birth - 1807). The Panorama was intended as a  "moving" picture--audiences watched as illustrations of Garibaldi's life were cranked before them in a special circular building (London Leicester Square's popular Barker Panorama theatre). We are now reanimating this object on a digital platform: we will recreate a virtual simulation of this spectacle, allowing the user to "scroll" through the panorama and listen to a bilingual voiceover narrative based on the original narrative (also acquired by the Brown library) that we are in the process of transcribing and translating into Italian; we will also make the manuscript available, both images and transcription, on VHL for scholars interested in exploring the panorama as a unique  historical source, in its connections to other contemporary popular media, such as biographies, novels, newspapers, etc.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The conception of truth proposed by Martin Heidegger's Being and Time is both provocative and problematic. On the one hand, Heidegger provides a way to reconnect technical accounts of truth with the cultural practices and social institutions from which these accounts take distance. On the other hand, Heidegger takes such a dim view of public communication that attaining truth becomes the inexplicable privilege of "authentic" existence. This essay aims to fashion an alternative conception of truth that frees Heidegger's insights from their reactionary garb. While agreeing with Heidegger that asserting is a mode of interpreting, I take issue with his description of the supposedly derivative character of assertions. Similarly, while endorsing Heidegger's claim that the agreement between assertion and object (what I call "correctness") derives from a more comprehensive process of disclosure (what I call "truth"), I criticize how he traces this derivation. In response, I propose to conceive of truth as a process of life-giving disclosure to which a differentiated array of cultural practices and products contribute in distinct and indispensable ways. What distinguishes true disclosure from false is not the authenticity with which human beings face the possibility of their own impossibility (their so-called "freedom toward death").  Rather it is their life-promoting and life-sustaining fidelity to that which they hold in common and which holds them in common. The pursuit of assertoric correctness is one important but limited way in which such fidelity occurs. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Field work presents special hazards to the researcher and their data, so researchers planning spend extended periods in the field should consider archiving their materials directly from the field.  Archiving from the field requires that both power and equipment.  Power requirements will vary depending on field situation, but in the worst case scenario, the researcher will need to rely completely on their own source of power.   This chapter presents a simple solar setup.  In short, all the researcher needs is the solar panels, a battery purchased in-country, and a few adaptors.  In order to archive from the field, however, the researcher also requires the means to create and send media to the archive.  Since audio and video files are quite large, the only practical means of sending them is by postal mail in the form of DVDs.  This means that the researcher must possess a laptop with a DVD burner and a supply of blank DVDs.  Moreover, the transfer of video on a laptop is very time-consuming, and as the technology stands today, there is no way to get high quality video when making the transfer in the field.  Finally, there remains the question of what is actually archived. In order to maximize research time in the field, the researcher can simply submit the metadata for each of the data files, leaving the archiving of the transcription to a later date.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines the contradiction between the apparent assignment of responsibility and its reality in sovereign loans to states since the 1970s.  It argues that the process of this assignment can be best described as the result of the gradual institutionalization of the juridical construction of knowledge.  Because juridically constructed causes often preclude real social causes – which include, at a minimum, the agency of creditors and indebted states, institutional settings, and structural conditions – they are an inaccurate and inadequate basis for social scientific inquiry.  The paper serves as what critical naturalists call an explanatory critique because it examines how the dominant normative discourse about a social practice (e.g., debt settlement practices) not only justifies the existing order and the power relations that surround a practice but also contradicts a scientific explanation for the practice that clarifies the causal mechanism. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article analyzes al-Jishumi's introduction to his seminal work al-Tahdhib fi Tafsir al-Qur'an (The Refinement in the Exegesis of the Qur'an). Al-Jishumi conceptualized hermeneutical exegesis to revolve around eight categories. Five of these categories the exegete has to relate exactly in the way they were established by the consensus of earlier exegetes: reading, philology, grammatical syntax, composition, and occasion of revelation of the Qur?anic text. The other three categories (meanings, evidences, and decrees) represent aspects where the exegete, as being under a divine obligation, has to demonstrate his own ability at rational inquiry to dislodge the meanings and the legal and theological implications of the Qur?an. In this way, al-Jishumi argued that exegesis is a dynamic and ongoing process, and never an accomplished task.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Initial study of Archaic houses at Azoria, with the goalto examine differential material patterns that might help us understand varying social roles within the community as reflected in architecture, artifact and ecofact assemblages, and physical proximity to the center of civic life. One focus of such work is to discern modes of mobilization, production, storage, and consumption of different kinds of resources—especially food—that might elucidate differences among domestic contexts and between habitation and civic space. This brief paper presents only the first step in this analysis, surveying the basic syntax of Archaic house forms recovered so far on the site.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Looking for Whitman" project served as an opportunity to illustrate how loosely networked learning spaces could be used to re-imagine the possibilities for connection among students and faculty working on related projects at a disparate range of institutions. As a case study for linked courses across universities, it framed the importance of an open and porous learning ecosystem that used network effects to aggregate and amplify student work, building a larger, focused conversation around the relationship of particular literary texts to particular geographical spaces.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the 21st century, how best to relate the history of the National Park Service's Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, the most popular historical attraction in the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area and a major archaeological site, with more than 1 million visitors per year and 2 million artifacts to show?  With digital stories told via mobile devices.  This chapter focuses on the "Fort Vancouver Mobile," an NEH-funded project that brings together a team of 18 experts and scholars from throughout the digital humanities field -- including historians, archaeologists and academics specializing in digital media production as well as literature, rhetoric and writing -- to tell the story of the fascinating and multicultural history of the place once dubbed the "New York of the Pacific."  We then discuss the ways design and non-fiction historical writing come together when mobile devices are used for digital storytelling.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Ottoman empire as a political entity comprised most of the present Middle East (with the principal exception of Iran), north Africa and south-eastern Europe. For over 500 years, until its disintegration during World War I, it encompassed a diverse range of ethnic, religious and linguistic communities with varying political and cultural backgrounds. Yet, was there such a thing as an ‘Ottoman world' beyond the principle of sultanic rule from Istanbul? Ottoman authority might have been established largely by military conquest, but how was it maintained for so long, over such distances and so many disparate societies? How did provincial regions relate to the imperial centre and what role was played in this by local elites? What did it mean in practice, for ordinary people, to be part of an ‘Ottoman world'?   pp. 86-110; N. Varlik adds a discussion of the wider Ottoman Empire and its interactions abroad in the context of the spread of disease.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Volume 4 of The Oxford History of Historical Writing offers essays by leading scholars on the writing of history globally from 1800 to 1945. Divided into four parts, it first covers the rise, consolidation, and crisis of European historical thought, and the professionalization and institutionalization of history. The chapters in Part Two analyze how historical scholarship connected to various European national traditions. Part Three considers the historical writing of Europe's 'Offspring': the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, and Spanish South America. The concluding part is devoted to histories of non-European cultural traditions: China, Japan, India, South East Asia, Turkey, the Arab world, and Sub-Saharan Africa.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Comparative Secularisms in a Global Age explores the history and politics of secularism and the public role of religion in France, India, Turkey, and the United States. It interprets the varieties of secularism as a series of evolving and contested processes of defining and remaking religion, rather than a static solution to the challenges posed by religious and political difference. It features essays from leading scholars from across disciplines, secular and religious traditions, and regional expertise. The volume illustrates a new approach to the hotly contested relation between political authority and religious tradition.</Abstract>

Bringing together scholars with a variety of perspectives and orientations, it provides a deeper understanding of the interconnections between law and religion and the unexpected histories and anthropologies of legal secularism in a globalizing modernity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Is the idea of the "Middle East" simply a geopolitical construct conceived by the West to serve particular strategic and economic interests-or can we identify geographical, historical, cultural, and political patterns to indicate some sort of internal coherence to this label? While the term has achieved common usage, no one studying the region has yet addressed whether this conceptualization has real meaning-and then articulated what and where the Middle East is, or is not.This volume fills the void, offering a diverse set of voices-from political and cultural historians, to social scientists</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay reconstructs the recent history of pain in childbirth, a universal physiological phenomenon intertwined with the socio-cultural context in which it unfolds. It focuses on the period from the 1950s through the 1970s, a time of flux in the understanding of childbirth pain within the medical profession and the general public. This era witnessed an emphasis on the role of female psychology in obstetric pain. Two similar psychological approaches to obstetric pain emerged: natural childbirth, promoted by British physician Grantly Dick-Read, and psychoprophylaxis, developed by Soviet neuropsychologist I. Z. Vel'vovskii and popularized in the West by French obstetrician Fernand Lamaze. In an effort to highlight trans-national influences and national idiosyncrasies, I take a comparative approach to the meanings attributed to childbirth pain in France and the United States, viewing them against related relevant developments in the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and tracing the ways in which the dynamic, dialogic clinical encounter between medical practitioners and their patients inscribed shifting social meanings and values on labor pain.</Abstract>

I will focus on the large exhibition of Indian crafts held at the Coronation Durbar in Delhi in 1903.  I will argue that this exhibition was the culmination of George Birdwood's theories about Indian crafts, various British imperial policy contradictions and the series of international exhibitions that created a discourse about craft in relation to fine arts and to manufacturing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1453-54, 313 witnesses testified at a Brittany inquest into the sanctity of Vincent Ferrer.  A number of witnesses at the canonization inquest testified about the miraculous cure in 1425 of one of the town's more prominent citizens, a client of Duke Pierre, a man named Perrinus Hervei, also known as Grasset.  Although in Perrinus's own testimony, he simply had gone out of his mind until placed on Vincent Ferrer's tomb, other witnesses were adamant that what they had seen was a case of demonic possession.  This article examines the testimony about Perrinus's miraculous healing as lens through which to view the nascent cult of Vincent Ferrer in Brittany. The timing of Perrinus's cure, as well as its prominence in the Brittany testimony, suggests its importance in the formation of the cult of Vincent Ferrer.  Furthermore, the testimony reveals the way in which various Bretons were attempting to shape the cult of the holy man on behalf of whose canonization they were testifying.  Some of the testimony indicates a desire to impugn the reputation of the Carmelites, whose activities had come under question in mid-fifteenth-century Brittany.  Other testimony underscores connections between the cult of Vincent Ferrer and the dukes of Brittany, who sought to gain a sacred legitimacy through stressing their ties to the holy preacher.   The testimony also hints at the ways in which promoters of Vincent's cult worked to publicize this and other miracles, particularly in the years leading up to the canonization inquest. Finally, the testimony about Perrinus's cure helps to reveal social networks in fifteenth-century Vannes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rites of investiture are critical opportunities for demonstrating, or at least simulating, the legitimate and orderly transfer of power. Sanctioned by precedent and often by a state religion, they are moments of peak political drama for which a substantial audience is required. Although such rituals might have a hidden, esoteric component, it is almost inconceivable that they could dispense with revealed stages in which the newly invested lord emerges to the acclaim of his subjects. &amp;#x0D;   It is logical, therefore, that plazas be a central focus in the search for arenas of investiture in the cityscapes of ancient Mesoamerica. Crowd capacity, restrictions of entry and visibility, and associated architecture are all important considerations, but without associated iconographic or textual evidence, definitive identification is often difficult. This paper examines investiture rituals for which we do have textual information, primarilyfrom the Basin of Mexico, Tlaxcala, and Puebla, and then argues for their application to sites falling within the broader "Toltec" tradition. (By this is meant cities following a political ideology first defined at Teotihuacan and then widely disseminated after its fall.) One lesson of these texts is that the investitures of paramounts and of their lords (tetecuhtin among Nahua groups) had many points in common and apparently used many of the same facilities, thus justifying their architectural investment and explaining associated iconography. &amp;#x0D;   Sub-royal investiture is particularly interesting in that rites frequently reaffirm not only the ties of vassal to paramount, but also the broader civic ties linking barrio residents (e.g., calpoleh) to their immediate lord (e.g., tecuhtli) and to the polity as a whole (e.g., altepetl). Such rites were often carried out at various locales, potentially providing at least a partial explanation for the distribution and articulation of plaza space throughout a site. &amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1573, Joannes Latinus (Juan Latino)—a former slave who rose to prominence in mid-sixteenth century Granada as a Latin educator— issued a volume of commemorative poetry about the Battle of Lepanto (October 7, 1571).  In this epochal naval clash, the Holy League Alliance comprised of Venice, Spain, and the Papacy attained an unexpected and resounding victory over the feared Ottoman navy.  By publishing his Lepanto commemoration, Latinus became the first writer born in sub-Saharan Africa to publish a book of poems in Europe.  The cornerstone of this volume is a two-book Vergilian epic, the Austrias Carmen.  An examination of this poem reveals signposts of modernity's fraught emergence in the Mediterranean.  Most immediately, Latinus's vivid Latin hexameters record how the Holy League Alliance's aggressive deployment of newer weapons technologies overwhelmed the Ottoman navy, which relied on the traditional military skills of its famed archers.  Throughout the poem, the freedman taps into the natural connection between epic poiesis and imperial ideology in order to reflect on cultural and political flashpoints Lepanto revealed.  In a celebratory vein, the poetic voice hails the naval victory as the dawn of a new European imperium anchored in the Roman church and Spanish military power.  Yet a web of allusions to the Aeneid mourns the high costs of empire building.  In one particularly deft imitation of Vergil's epic, the poetic voice exposes the tactically and morally dubious infighting that divided the Spanish forces, as soldiers and their commanders sought to claim captured Ottoman combatants as slaves.  This reflection on the victors' inglorious transformation from fighters to slave traders strikes a marked contrast to other Spanish poets of Lepanto, who do not directly narrate this post-battle contest.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1941, A. Furumark divided LH IIIA2 into two successive sub-phases. Until recently, however, no pure settlement contexts belonging to the earlier horizon had been published from the Greek mainland and a detailed definition of the period remained elusive. This lack of evidence has now been partially overcome by the discovery of some important LH IIIA2 deposits from Nichoria, Tsoungiza, and Ayios Stephanos. Nevertheless, no significant assemblages of this date have been published thus far from central Greece and, as a result, the validity of Furumark's subdivision for the entire Mycenaean world still awaits confirmation</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For various reasons, large storage vessels rarely attract the attention of pottery specialists. It is quite remarkable that prehistoric pithoi from the Greek mainland have not received a thorough treatment so far, in contrast to their Cretan or Cypriot counterparts. The article attempts to fill partially the gap and to show the potential of such a study for approaching wider issues of social, economic, and political developments of LBA/EIA Central Greece.&amp;#x0D; The majority of the pithoi derive from the site of Mitrou. Fragments from two other sites located nearby—the settlement of Kynos and the sanctuary at Kalapodi—complete our dataset. The outstanding characteristic of these pithoi is their size and decoration, consisting of designs made by impressions of a toothed tool. Macroscopic analysis of fabrics supports the existence of several workshops serving more than a single site. Various lines of interpretation of the distributional pattern and the sudden rise of this type of pithos (and pithoi in general) at the LBA/EIA transition are suggested and elaborated.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper discusses the Spondylus gaederopus shells from two sites on the North&amp;#x0D; Euboean Gulf in Central Greece. These are the Early Bronze Age settlement of Proskinas, situated 2 km from the coast and the Middle Bronze Age to Early Iron Age site of Mitrou, a small tidal islet in the Bay of Atalanti. The quantitative and qualitative study of the many molluscan species showed that shells were gathered for different purposes, i.e. food, purple-dye production, jewelry and tools.&amp;#x0D; There was a special preference in the gathering of Spondylus gaederopus, however, for eating and for tool making. At the site of Proskynas, Spondylus not only forms the main species of the assemblage (316 out of 784 shells), but there is also clear evidence that it was gathered beach-worn to serve as scraping, scaling or percussion implement. The situation is different at the site of Mitrou; there, Spondylus is in quantity the third species in the assemblage (749 out of 6325), but was primarily gathered for food and was only secondarily used as a tool. The paper explores the choronological and spatial data of the two sites, which indicate the differences in Spondylus gaederopus usage. It will also try to pinpoint differences in the perception and use of Spondylus between the Neolithic and Bronze Age and between Central and Northern Greece.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1930 the award-winning French novelist and critic, Georges Duhamel condemned appetite for consumer goods and entertainment, and criticized commercial broadcasting, illustrating an important dimension of the global history of communications and culture. Well before the early 1930s, when semi-regular U.S. shortwave radio broadcasts began reaching France, concerned French citizens wondered about transatlantic connectivity and the specter of commercial radio. This article concentrates on French print journalism reporting on the changing U.S. broadcast landscape of the 1920s and 1930s. From the specific reportage and editorial commentary of Le Petit Radio (a booster of the French public radio system), three evocative themes emerge: critical reaction to the "wild West" of US radio growth, an equivocal response to the celebrated modernism of RCA's Radio City, and claims that radio advertising degenerated culture, and must be limited or eradicated. The ideologically charged treatment of U.S. broadcasting in France that resulted casts fresh light on how ideas associated with "American radio" (and America) took hold within communications policy debates and French culture, as proponents of private and public models for national broadcasting competed for advantage in a widening arena of global connection and competition.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This pioneering comparative study of British imperialism in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds draws on the perspectives of British newcomers overseas and their native hosts, of metropolitan officials and corporate enterprises, migrants and settlers. Leading scholars examine the divergences and commonalities in the legal and economic regimes that allowed Britain to project imperium across the globe. They explore the nature of sovereignty and law, governance and regulation, diplomacy, military relations and commerce, shedding new light on the processes of expansion that influenced the making of empire. While acknowledging the distinctions and divergences in imperial endeavours in Asia and the Americas - not least in terms of the size of indigenous populations, technical and cultural differences, and approaches to indigenous polities - this book argues that these differences must be seen in the context of what Britons overseas shared, including constitutional principles, claims of sovereignty, disciplinary regimes and military attitudes.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over a hundred and fifty years after the first appearance of Walt Whitman's  Leaves of Grass , Whitman's work inspired a series of pedagogical experiments that transposed his experimental teaching philosophy and his poetry into the era of networked learning through a project entitled "Looking for Whitman: The Poetry of Place in the Life and Work of Walt Whitman." Sponsored by two Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants from the United States National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the project brought together classes from four academic institutions in a collaborative digital environment that emphasized place-based learning and progressive educational techniques. The project set forth a new model for aggregated, collaborative and open learning practices that mirrored Whitman's own poetic ideals and that has served as an important example of digital pedagogy for the digital humanities community. Like Whitman's own checkered career as a teacher, however, the project's successes and its failures point towards future developments along related lines. As I discuss the project and describe some of the ways in which others might extend its work, I hope to articulate some of the reasons why the digital humanities, as a field, would benefit from a more direct engagement with issues of teaching and learning than it has exhibited thus far.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What does it mean to conduct research for justice with youth and communities who are marginalized by systems of inequality based on race, ethnicity, sexuality, citizenship status, gender, and other categories of difference? In this collection, editors Django Paris and Maisha Winn have selected essays written by top scholars in education on humanizing approaches to qualitative and ethnographic inquiry with youth and their communities. Vignettes, portraits, narratives, personal and collaborative explorations, photographs, and additional data excerpts bring the findings to life for a better understanding of how to use research for positive social change.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The majority of American Indian students attend public schools in the United States. However, education mandated for American Indian students since the 1800s has been primarily education for assimilation, with the goal of eliminating American Indian cultures and languages. Indeed, extreme measures were taken to ensure Native students would "act white" as a result of their involvement with Western education. Today's educational mandates continue a hegemonic "one-size-fits-all" approach to education. This is in spite of evidence that these approaches have rarely worked for Native students and have been extremely detrimental to Native communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How do language policies in schools create inequalities among learners? How do policies marginalize some students while granting privilege to others? How do language policies in education serve the interests of dominant groups within societies? How can linguistic minorities further their interests through attempts to change language policies in schools? This new edition of Language Policies in Education takes a fresh look at these enduring questions at the heart of fundamental debates about the role of schools in society, the links between education and employment, and conflicts between linguistic minorities and "mainstream" populations. Reflecting developments in language policy since the publication of the first edition in 2002, all chapters are original and substantial contributions to the study of language policy and exemplify major theories and research methods in the field. Chapter authors are major scholars in language policy and critical language studies. The case studies, international in scope, present cutting-edge analyses of important language policy debates in countries around the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the last 50 years, language policy has developed into a major discipline, drawing on research and practice in many nations and at many levels. This is the first Handbook to deal with language policy as a whole and is a complete 'state-of-the-field' survey, covering language practices, beliefs about language varieties, and methods and agencies for language management. It provides a historical background which traces the development of classical language planning, describes activities associated with indigenous and endangered languages, and contains chapters on imperialism, colonialism, effects of migration and globalization, and educational policy. It also evaluates language management agencies, analyzes language activism and looks at language cultivation (including reform of writing systems, orthography and modernized terminology). The definitive guide to the subject, it will be welcomed by students, researchers and language professionals in linguistics, education and politics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This study of South Carolina presentments, the grand jury's critiques and accusations against their fellow community members, reveals that complaints about slave behaviors gradually declined during the eighteenth century. Meanwhile, their complaints about badly maintained roads, bridges, and causeways continued to be aired with regularity. Urbanization slowly changed what the Charleston grand jurors demanded, as calls for incorporation rose in the 1770s, while backcountry grand jurors continued making presentments about inadequate roads and misbehaving slaves to the end of the century.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Buried Lives offers the first critical examination of the experience of imprisonment in early America. These interdisciplinary essays investigate several carceral institutions to show how confinement shaped identity, politics, and the social imaginary both in the colonies and in the new nation. The historians and literary scholars included in this volume offer a complement and corrective to conventional understandings of incarceration that privilege the intentions of those in power over the experiences of prisoners.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Considering such varied settings as jails, penitentiaries, almshouses, workhouses, floating prison ships, and plantations, the contributors reconstruct the struggles of people imprisoned in locations from Antigua to Boston. The essays draw upon a rich array of archival sources from the seventeenth century to the eve of the Civil War, including warden logs, petitions, execution sermons, physicians' clinical notes, private letters, newspaper articles, runaway slave advertisements, and legal documents. Through the voices, bodies, and texts of the incarcerated, Buried Lives reveals the largely ignored experiences of inmates who contested their subjection to regimes of power.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The opposition between ‘religion' and ‘modernity' has long held the status of a self-evident truth. Recently, however, there has been a growing realization that religion has not died out and may be more compatible with modern society than previously assumed.This development is particularly striking in France where laïcité has long been the official doctrine.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; How did religion become opposed to the secular and modern? If distinctions between sacred and secular are less adequate than commonly believed, how do these two categories interact?Addressing these questions, this book explores the persistence of religious categories on the cultural landscape of early modern France. France was the birthplace of Europe's first secular state and the centre of two movements considered indispensable to secularization - the Enlightenment and Revolution of 1789. As such France is vital for understanding how religious antecedents informed modern political institutions and ideals. By uncovering the role of religion in shaping categories most often associated with modernity this book offers a new perspective on the master narrative of secularization.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the tumultuous period of world history from 1660 to 1815, three complex movements combined to bring a fundamental cultural reorientation to Europe and North America, and ultimately to the wider world. The Enlightenment transformed views of nature and of the human capacity to master nature. The religious reawakenings brought a revival of heart-felt, experiential Christianity. Finally revolution, the political and social upheavals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, challenged established ideas of divine-right monarchies and divinely ordained social hierarchies, and promoted more democratic government, notions of human rights and religious toleration. A new religious climate emerged, in which people were more likely to look to their own feelings and experiences for the basis of their faith. During this same period, Christianity spread widely around the world as a result of colonialism and missions, and responded in diverse ways to its encounters with other cultures and religious traditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This major work of academic reference provides a comprehensive overview of the development of western political thought during the European enlightenment. Written by a distinguished team of international contributors, this Cambridge History is the latest in a sequence of volumes that is now firmly established as the principal reference source for the history of political thought. Every major theme in eighteenth-century political thought is covered in a series of essays at once scholarly and accessible, and the essays are complemented by extensive guides for further reading, and brief biographical notes of the major characters in the text, including Rousseau, Montesquieu and David Hume. Of interest and relevance to students and scholars of politics and history at all levels from beginning undergraduate upwards, this volume chronicles one of the most exciting and rewarding of all periods in the development of western thinking about politics, man (and increasingly woman), and society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Long before the Boston Tea Party, where colonists staged a revolutionary act by masquerading as Indians, people looked to Native Americans for the symbols, imagery, and acts that showed what it meant to be "American." And for just as long, observers have largely overlooked the role that Native peoples themselves played in creating and enacting the Indian performances appropriated by European Americans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Spaniards typically portrayed the conquest and fall of Mexico Tenochtitlan as Armageddon, while native peoples in colonial Mesoamerica continued to write and paint their histories and lives often without any mention of the foreigners in their midst. Their accounts took the form of annals, chronicles, religious treatises, tribute accounts, theatre pieces, and wills. Thousands of documents were produced, almost all of which served to preserve indigenous ways of doing things. But what provoked record keeping on such a grand scale? At what point did precontact sacred writing become utilitarian and quotidian? Were their texts documentaries, a form of boosterism, even ingenious intellectualism, or were they ultimately a literature of ruin? This volume seeks to address key aspects of indigenous perspectives of the conquest and Spanish colonialism by examining what they themselves recorded and why they did so.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Separated only by a narrow body of water, Spain and England have had a long history of material and cultural interactions; but this intertwined history is rarely perceived by scholars of one country with a view toward the other. Through their analyses of the various modes of exchange of material goods and the circulation of symbolic systems of meaning, the contributors to the anthology-historians and literary critics-investigate, for the first time, the two nations' express points of contact and conflict during these historically crucial fifty years. Focusing on the half-century period that began with the marriage of Mary Tudor to Prince Philip of Spain, and spanned the reigns of Philip II and Elizabeth I of England, the essays in this anthology demonstrate and problematize, from the perspective of Spanish cultural history, the significant material, cultural, and symbolic contacts between the two countries.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The volume shows how the two countries' alliances and clashes, which led to the debacle of the 'Invincible Armada' of 1588 and continued for decades afterwards, held enormous historical significance by shaping the religious, political, and cultural developments of the modern world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Buried Lives offers the first critical examination of the experience of imprisonment in early America. These interdisciplinary essays investigate several carceral institutions to show how confinement shaped identity, politics, and the social imaginary both in the colonies and in the new nation. The historians and literary scholars included in this volume offer a complement and corrective to conventional understandings of incarceration that privilege the intentions of those in power over the experiences of prisoners.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Considering such varied settings as jails, penitentiaries, almshouses, workhouses, floating prison ships, and plantations, the contributors reconstruct the struggles of people imprisoned in locations from Antigua to Boston. The essays draw upon a rich array of archival sources from the seventeenth century to the eve of the Civil War, including warden logs, petitions, execution sermons, physicians' clinical notes, private letters, newspaper articles, runaway slave advertisements, and legal documents. Through the voices, bodies, and texts of the incarcerated, Buried Lives reveals the largely ignored experiences of inmates who contested their subjection to regimes of power.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Women and Material Culture presents a collection of twelve illustrated and interdisciplinary essays on gender and material culture across the long eighteenth century. Written by scholars from the USA, the UK and Europe, these essays point to the manifold ways in which gender mediated and was shape by the consumption and production of consumable goods (from clothing and artworks to books) and elucidate the complex and shifting relationships between material and social practice in the period.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The study of material objects and their visual and textual representation reminds us that the meanings of objects - like the meaning of gender - are neither monolithic nor stable. Women and Material Culture explores some of the many ways in which women across eighteenth-century Europe actively participated in the social production of meaning through the consumption, creation and deployment of material artefacts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book presents the way in which the religious identification of African American Jews and African black Jews – "real", ideal or imaginary – has been represented, conceptualized and reconfigured over the last century or so. These essays grow out of a concern to understand Black encounters with Judaism, Jews and putative Hebrew/Israelite origins and are intended to illuminate their developments in the medley of race, ethnicity, and religion of the African and African American religious experience. They reflect the geographical and historic mosaic of black Judaism, permeated as it is with different "meanings", both contemporary and historical.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Oxford Handbook of the American Revolution draws on a wealth of new scholarship to create a vibrant dialogue among varied approaches to the revolution that made the United States. In thirty-three essays written by authorities on the period, the Handbook brings to life the diverse multitudes of colonial North America and their extraordinary struggles before, during, and after the eight-year-long civil war that secured the independence of thirteen rebel colonies from their erstwhile colonial parent. The chapters explore battles and diplomacy, economics and finance, law and culture, politics and society, gender, race, and religion. Its diverse cast of characters includes ordinary farmers and artisans, free and enslaved African Americans, Indians, and British and American statesmen and military leaders. In addition to expanding the Revolution's who, the Handbook broadens its where, portraying an event that far transcended the boundaries of what was to become the United States. It offers readers an American Revolution whose impact ranged far beyond the thirteen coloniesThe Handbook's range of interpretive and methodological approaches captures the full scope of current revolutionary-era scholarship. Its authors, British and American scholars spanning several generations, include social, cultural, military, and imperial historians, as well as those who study politics, diplomacy, literature, gender, and sexuality. Together and separately, these essays demonstrate that the American Revolution remains a vibrant and inviting a subject of inquiry. Nothing comparable has been published in decades</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Holding his dead daughter, old Lear suddenly believes he sees something given to none of this life to behold; "Look, her lips, / Look there, look there," he vainly bids the other players, as Cordelia's soul, heaven bound, issues from her limp body. In making these a dying madman's words, however, Shakespeare invites his audience to consider rather the fact that we see nothing, and thus to reflect upon the gaping void that seems to lie between Christian promises of salvation and the play's depiction of a bleak, inhospitable universe. Thirty years earlier, Montaigne staged this same scene, to much the same effect, in his essay "Of exercise," casting himself not only in the roles of both Lear and Cordelia, but also in that of the duly skeptical spectator. This paper seeks to situate these two ambiguous stagings of the Christian "death" in a wider social context of popular anxiety about salvation and native skepticism over the immortality of the soul. It argues that Montaigne purposely evokes a tradition of heterodoxical responses to the problem of death beginning with the second chapter of the Wisdom of Solomon and stretching to Anabaptism. Instead of a Christian afterlife, Montaigne intimates that his spirit will live on not in his resurrected body but in a mummy, "I expose myself entire: my portrait is a cadaver on which the veins, the muscles, and the tendons appear at a glance (Frame, 274), the mummy, then, of his book, tightly bound in dried pigskin.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In 1589, Paris experienced an unprecedented wave of fanaticism. Outraged at the king's Christmas assassination of the Guise brothers, the city revolted against the crown and was swept with nearly daily religious processions. But despite Denis Crouzet's compelling account of the millennial and apocalyptic tendencies driving the movement, examination of the Holy League's rhetoric reveals a powerful counter-current that quickly drew writers back to the calmer waters of common sense. Having become preoccupied with the moderate "Politiques," whom they sought to caricature through the figure of the Unresolved Man, Leaguers found themselves forced to mimic the rhetoric of their asymmetrical opponent. Through Matthieu's Guisiade and Marlowe's Edward II, the Unresolved Man of these pamphlets stands as a direct ancestor of Hamlet and the modern, "undecided" subject.</Abstract>

Fassin and his international group of experts examine the political, religious, and medical components of morals, moralities and ethics. Their research represents a rapidly growing interest in the ethnography of moralities, the study of moral subjectivities, and the exploration of moral economies.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The collection features contributions from Didier Fassin—a doctor and scholar who has pioneered research in the field of moral anthropology.  He introduces the genealogical and epistemological issues in a moral anthropology. The distinguished contributors explore the formation of moral facts (including values, virtues, and sentiments); local moralities in various contexts (around piety, poverty, or sexuality); perspectives on historically and culturally situated social worlds (such as religion, science, or finance); and the frontier between moralities and politics (issues such as humanitarianism, punishment, or borders). These original essays engage a dialogue with various disciplines, from moral philosophy to the cognitive sciences. A Companion to Moral Anthropology offers a timely and thought-provoking glimpse into the current state and future directions of an important new discipline of the 21st-century world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This historiographical essay reviews recent work on women's and gender history and argues for a broader view of the movement for women's emancipation, extending beyond suffrage and voting rights.  It challenges limitations in the "first wave/second wave" model that has been central to the story of women's history in the United States.  (This article was deeply influenced by the research on Mary Lease and women's political activism, made possible by the NEH grant.)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Central to the functioning of Paul's Cross as a venue for public discourse between rulers and ruled in early modern England was the actual experience of hearing sermons delivered to crowds of people in an outdoor space in the midst of urban London.  Working with a team of architects, acoustic engineers, linguists, and actors, we have engaged in recreating the experience of being present for the delivery of a Paul's Cross sermon in a virtual model of the space in which it was originally delivered.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is one of two chapters on the historiography of Lincoln and economics for the upcoming Blackwell Companion to Abraham Lincoln.  In it I treat scholarly treatments as well as political appropriations of Lincoln's economic views and programs from his death to about 1970.  This historiography is analytic and has a thesis.  I argue that the need for a "self-made man," for a homespun, "common man", and especially, the need to believe that the American past was "stateless" especially regarding the role of government in the economy, led to the disappearance from scholarship and American memory not only of Lincoln's political economy, but of his entire political party.  Only by recovering the Whigs and the extensive role of government in the 19th century economy can we fully recover Lincoln place in the history of U.S. political economy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter picks up where "Remember the Whigs I" left off with Gabor Boritt's work on "Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream" of the 1970's.  It continues the duel focus on scholarship and popular appropriations of Lincoln's record on the role of government in the economy.  In particular I critique Republican Party and libertarian narratives that assume a stateless American past and decry what they then see as a descent into big government.  Libertarians blame the descent on Lincoln while mainstream Republicans look for a way to get Lincoln off the hook.  Both assume a picture of past American political economy that is unsustainable.  Indeed they have the story backward.  Radically liberal anti-state theories arise AFTER the Civil War and did not characterize the antebellum period.  Only occasionally have Democratic politicians sought to enlist Lincoln for their cause while the scholarly left seems largely uninterested.  Political writers and scholars of all persuasions have underestimated the degree to which creating the conditions in which men could achieve economic independence rather than rising wages or material prosperity was the generally accepted goal of political economy in the Lincoln's lifetime.  This goal was largely abandoned on all sides, right ant left, by the 20th century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nicholas Cahill's contribution covers the work done to map Sardis and its immediate environs. Cahill summarizes the long history of survey and mapping done in the Sardis area, from the 1962 map drawn up by the State Board of Waterworks until the present day. Cahill highlights some of the difficulties in creating an accessible and consistent map of Sardis over the years, and explains how these have been overcome. In the second part of the paper, Cahill moves on to consider the location of the main city of Sardis through the centuries. This has proved an enduring problem for researchers, with the Roman and Lydian cities apparently being in one location with no clear signs of Achaemenid occupation in the same area.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Translation and commentary on a story drawn from the Vilayetname of Haci Bektas Veli, a central text associated with the Bektasi and Alevi traditions.  Originally composed in Ottoman Turkish, the work is known in numerous manuscripts dating as early as the 11th century.  It tells the life story of Haci Bektas, perhaps the most famous of Turkish sufis.  This short story tells of Sari Ismail, a disciple of Haci Bektas, who becomes a teacher in his own right, converting the people to Islam, creating miracles, following the sufi path.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The tales of the mi'raj describe the prophet Muhammad's journey through the heavens, his encounters with prophets and angels, and his visit to heaven and hell. The tales are among Islam's most popular, appearing in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literature, and in later adaptations throughout the Muslim world. Often serving as narratives designed to promote the worldview of particular Muslim groups, the tales were also a means for communities to construct rules of normative behavior and ritual practices, and were used to assert the superiority of Islam over other religions. The essays in this collection discuss the formation of this narrative, the mi'raj as a missionary text, its various adaptations, its application to esoteric thought, and its use in performance and ritual.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The earliest European accounts of Brazil's indigenous inhabitants focused on the natives' startling appearance and conduct--especially their nakedness and cannibalistic rituals--and on the process of converting them to clothed, docile Christian vassals.

Incorporating the tools of anthropology, geography, cultural studies, and literary analysis, alongside those of history, the contributors revisit old sources and uncover new ones.

Some of the peoples they investigate were ultimately defeated and displaced by the implacable advance of settlement. Many individuals died from epidemics, frontier massacres, and forced labor. Hundreds of groups eventually disappeared as distinct entities. Yet many others found ways to prolong their independent existence or to enter colonial and later national society, making constrained but pivotal choices along the way.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article explores the impact of neoliberal logics of voice on the music - making and performance practices of female playback singers in the South Indian Tamil film industry. As singers whose voices are first recorded in the studio and then "played back" on the set to be lip-synched by actors, playback singers have been professional musicians and public celebrities since the 1950s. Their careers are governed by practices of voice cultivation and by modes of performance and public self-presentation, in the studio, on stage, and increasingly in mediatized contexts. Since the 1990s, neoliberal logics of flexibility, entrepreneurship and self-marketing have redefined the role of the playback singer and the way singers conceive of their work in both social and aesthetic terms. These changes have occurred within a broader context in which anxieties about globalization and expanding commodity culture are reflected in debates about the place of women in public.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay examines the of colonial encounter as a scene of translation, focusing on the degree to which colonial encounter is a scene—an embodied  performance—as much as on the extent to which this encounter concerns translation, linguistic force, and erasure. More specifically, it sketches a New World genealogy of theatricalized colonial encounters, beginning with Prospero and Caliban's encounter in Shakespeare's&amp;#x0D; The Tempest  (1611), and following its permutations in John Dryden and William Davenant's The Enchanted  Island (1667), through Daniel Defoe's scene of encounter between Robinson Crusoe and Friday in Robinson Crusoe (1719), and Richard Sheridan's theatricalized version of the same—Harlequin Friday or Robinson Crusoe&amp;#x0D;  (1781). The essay analyzes each of these texts in relation to a central scene of colonial encounter that, in every case, is also a scene of translation and/or language instruction. It also aims to consider the way in which this genealogy of texts is itself marked by translation—Dryden and Davenant translate Shakespeare; Sheridan translates Defoe. And finally, it focuses in particular on one historical locus of these multiple translations—namely, the performance history of The Tempest and Robinson Crusoe in the theaters of Charleston, S.C. in the 1790s. This performance history, occurring at a time when the theater had enormous cultural currency, underscores the significance of the geographical translation of English texts to American stages and points, as I ultimately want to argue, to the importance of the embodied public—the embodied scene of encounter with its attendant remains—in the creole culture of America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Yosmaoglu discusses the Berlin Congress of 1895 through the Dayton Accord, 1993, and the maps that followed on them, when international understanding gave legitimacy to dubious boundaries.  These pacts reveal the power of foreign constructs to frieze a fluid social context in to an identity.  Her article charts the way in which the social reality of a Macedonia partitioned among nation-states was created out of a virtual reality of ethnographic maps printed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Unsettled States, Dana Luciano and Ivy G. Wilson present some of the most exciting emergent scholarship in American literary and cultural studies of the "long" nineteenth century. Featuring eleven essays from senior scholars across the discipline, the book responds to recent critical challenges to the boundaries, both spatial and temporal, that have traditionally organized scholarship within the field. The volume considers these recent challenges to be aftershocks of earlier revolutions in content and method, and it seeks ways of inhabiting and amplifying the ongoing unsettledness of the field.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Written by scholars primarily working in the "minor" fields of critical race and ethnic studies, feminist and gender studies, labor studies, and queer/sexuality studies, the essays share a minoritarian critical orientation. Minoritarian criticism, as an aesthetic, political, and ethical project, is dedicated to finding new connections and possibilities within extant frameworks. Unsettled States seeks to demonstrate how the goals of minoritarian critique may be actualized without automatic recourse to a predetermined "minor" location, subject, or critical approach. Its contributors work to develop practices of reading an "American literature" in motion, identifying nodes of inquiry attuned to the rhythms of a field that is always on the move. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; (Description of book: chapter description unavailable)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The task of the institute is to produce the first comprehensive scholarly dictionary of ancient Latin from the earliest times down to AD 600. The work is based on an archive of about 10 million slips which takes account of all surviving texts. In the older texts there is a slip for each occurrence of each word; the later ones are generally covered by a selection of lexicographically relevant examples. Nowadays this material is supplemented, where appropriate, by the use of modern data-banks. The dictionary articles result from a critical inspection and interpretation of this material. They allow the user to follow the development of meaning and usage in each word. Publication is in separate fascicules; more than two thirds of the complete work have appeared in the printed version and also (on the initiative of the publishers) in electronic form.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How useful is the concept of patrimonialism to analyze state formation and political dynamics in postcolonial nation-states? Using Tunisia, Morocco, and Iraq during critical periods of state-building following the end of colonial rule, the author considers this question. The purpose of the article is to build on Max Weber by exploring how patrimonialism operates in kin-based social contexts where power on the basis of kinship ties is exerted not only by a central authority but also by leaders of local communities organized along lines of real or fictive kinship—as was the case in the three countries in the period under examination. Suggesting that Weber undertheorized the way in which central authority relates to local collectivities in his analysis of patrimonialism, the author identifies three patterns in the strategies used by central power toward local patrimonial networks: marginalization, integration, and shifts between marginalization and integration. The article argues that central patrimonialism can be accommodated with all three strategies directed toward local patrimonialism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Food has a special significance in the expanding field of global history. Food markets were the first to become globally integrated, linking distant cultures of the world, and in no other area have the interactions between global exchange and local cultural practices been as pronounced as in changing food cultures.

		<Abstract>A study of the nature of the imagination and its role in our experience of narrative works of art.   Questions addressed include: How do our imaginings interact with our beliefs in our understanding of a fictional story?  How can fiction-directed emotions (emotions triggered by what is only fictional) be explained through appeal to the functions of the imagination? And, What is the connection between the theoretical and practical norms we observe in our mental responses to the real world and those norms we adopt in experiencing fictional worlds?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Well-Connected Domains offers a fresh perspective on the history of the Ottoman Empire as deeply connected to the world beyond its borders by way of trade, warfare and diplomacy, as much as intellectual exchanges, migration, and personal relations.&amp;#x0D; While for decades the Ottoman Empire has been portrayed as largely aloof and distant from - as well as disinterested in - developments abroad, this collection of essays edited by Pascal W. Firges, Tobias P. Graf, Christian Roth, and Gülay Tulasoglu highlights the deep entanglement between the Ottoman realm and its European neighbors. Taking their starting points from individual case studies, the contributions offer novel interpretations of a variety of aspects of Ottoman history as well as new impulses for future research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book chapter explores the contested understanding of empire in the United States in 1836, at the time of the Texas Revolution. For opponents of empire, the annexation of Texas offered evidence that the United States was following the same path as Rome, and would soon fall. But supporters of empire believed that the annexation of Texas proved that the United States was exceptional.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To date, scholarship on the role of Afro-Argentines in their nation's culture has given little attention to cinema. Jorge Fortes and Diego Ceballos's movie documentary Afroargentinos (Afro-Argentines, 2002) includes three clips from earlier Argentine films showing blacks. Alejandro Solomianski's Identidades secretas: la negritud argentina dedicates eight pages of his 277 page text to discussing the representation of blacks in Leopoldo Torre Nilson's El santo de la espada (The Saint with the Sword, 1969) and Maria Luisa Bemberg's Camila (1984) and to identifying the central role of mulatto filmmaker Jose' Agustin Ferreyra in the development of Argentine Cinema (259-262, 231-234).&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book is about various linguistic aspects and consequences of the effective colonization of Latin America by Portugal and Spain since the dawn of the 16th century. It is about how Portuguese and Spanish (then known only as Castilian) have both been influenced by their contacts with indigenous and other languages in their Iberian colonies, as well as how the indigenous languages in particular have also been affected by the colonial languages. The book provides novel perspectives onto how the European colonists first communicated with the Natives, onto the role played by the "factors," missionaries, Mestizos, and Pardos as interpreters, and onto why one should not assume that jargons or pidgins emerged of necessity out of the initial inter-group contacts. Insights are likewise provided about the gradual ways in which Portuguese and Spanish spread, about how some major indigenous languages (such as Quechua and Tupinamba´) at first benefited from the European colonization and from their adoption by missionaries as lingua francas for proselytizing, as well as about why some Native American languages are being threatened only now or don't appear to be (seriously) endangered yet. Throughout the volume, one has to ask who have been the actual agents and/or drivers of the changes that have affected both indigenous and initially exogenous languages, positively or negatively, in Latin America. And what are the relevant ecological factors that have triggered or simply borne on these evolutions? The subject of African substrate influence is also dealt with, alongside that of Italian adstrate influence on Argentine Spanish. (abstract is on complete book)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the archaeology of colonial and antebellum African America one of the most evocative artifact classes is low-fired earthenware.  The blanket term usually applied to this category –colonoware – has entered the archaeological vocabulary rather uncritically despite its deeply contested meaning.  In this chapter we examine how colonoware has been used as a category in Louisiana archaeology; consider the ways in which life in the French/Spanish colony – different in many ways from life in the English colonies – might effect the development and use of low-fired earthenwares; and consider  methods one might use to explore inter and intra-regional diversity in this ceramic technology. When comparing contact period and early colonial Native American pottery assemblages with late colonial to early American period Euro-African pottery assemblages it is apparent that low-fired earthenwares go from being the only available ceramic in northwest Louisiana in the mid 1600s to a seemingly obsolete ware by about 1830. Simultaneously, as Euro-American wares came to dominate the vessels being used at plantations, urban homes, and Native American villages, the amount of decorated low-fired earthenwares became increasingly sparse.  In terms of makers, there are strong correspondences between the Coincoin colonowares and known Native American decorated types of the historic period, particularly as they relate to the Caddo and possibly the Apalachee, Choctaw, Natchez, and Coushatta, but this does not rule out the possibility of African production. Additional technical analyses, perhaps focused on untempered wares, may clarify this issue.&amp;#x0D; </Abstract>

		<Abstract>The essays in this collection reconsider boundaries and categories of music and musicianship that have been convenient for scholarly discussion of the periods from Elizabeth's predecessor's reign through the end of the eighteenth century, but, on closer examination, prove to be fluid. Many of the categories applied to seventeenth-century English music-making are at best anachronistic. Chief among these are hard divisions between the public and the private, and between so-called amateur (or even "recreational") and professional musicianship. Other convenient binaries such as female and male, Catholic and Protestant, oral and written, high art and popular, and creator and consumer failed to account accurately for a great deal of musical activity. Even the clear picture of institutional separation for music-making into court, church, theatre, and chamber so beloved by introductory textbooks become murky as we considered the contents of manuscripts, title pages and dedications of print collections, the circulation of cheap print products such as broadsides and magazines, and performance practices for anything classified as dramatic or theatrical. Above all, music emerged as a complex social process that united and divided individuals and groups across space, place, and even time. The contents of this book reflect these nuances.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>English music studies often apply rigid classifications to musical materials, their uses, their consumers, and performers. The contributors to this volume argue that some performers and manuscripts from the early modern era defy conventional categorization as “amateur” or “professional,” “native” or “foreign.” These leading scholars explore the circulation of music and performers in early modern England, reconsidering previously held ideas about the boundaries between locations of musical performance and practice.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>This chapter will draw on the results of a large-scale text analysis project using computational tools to automatically identify reprinted texts in the millions of pre-1861 pages in the Library of Congress' Chronicling America newspaper collection. Thus far the study has uncovered nearly 50,000 "viral texts": news stories, short fiction pieces, poems, and prose vignettes that circulated among readers and editors in the decades before the civil war. I use the phrase "viral texts" deliberately, as our findings point to a range of textual sharing practices beyond simple reprinting, including reprinting, reauthorship, and remixing. Analyzed at scale, viral texts can be read as powerful indicators of influence, pointing to those publications who printed texts most often appropriated by others. To that end, this chapter will employ network analysis techniques with our project's data to model the system of antebellum newspapers, analyzing whose texts were most likely to be reprinted elsewhere, and thus helped shape antebellum taste and opinion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jackie Murray's "Anchored in time: The date in Apollonius' Argonautica" (247-284) applies the descriptions of celestial phenomena in the epic to the unresolved question of its date. The indications of the stars (and planets) support her position that "the skyscape of the Argonautica mirrors that above Alexandria in the year of [Ptolemy III's] jubilee" and therefore the epic "must have participated in or at least responded to Ptolemy III's construction of his reign as a new era" (270).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Destruction remains a relatively unexplored and badly understood topic in archaeology and history. The term itself refers to some form and measurable degree of damage inflicted to an object, a system or a being, usually exceeding the stage during which repair is still possible but most often it is examined for its impact with destructive events interpreted in terms of a punctuated equilibrium, extraordinary features that represent the end of an archaeological culture or historical phase and the beginning of a new one.

		<Abstract>As a result of a concern with the spoken (and sung)  voice, recent scholarship on early modern preaching has suggested the importance of recognizing sermons as things heard, as performances, delivered on specific occasions in particular locales and in the presence of unique gatherings of people.  The question of post-Reformation English Christianity as a religion functioning in an oral culture, with speaking and hearing at the heart of its character, has been reinforced for me through my work with the Virtual Paul's Cross Project (vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu). This project, funded by a grant from the Endowment for the Humanities, uses digital modeling technology to recreate as fully as possible the experience of hearing Donne preach his sermon for Guy Fawkes Day on November 5, 1622. Through this project, we are able to join the crowd gathered at Paul's Cross, the preaching station in the churchyard of St Paul's Cathedral in London, to hear Donne's sermon performed, to experience it as an event unfolding in real time, moment by moment, an interactive and collaborative occasion heard in the physical space for which Donne composed it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>History of editing through the eyes of cinemetrics. &amp;#x0D; Montage theory began as a theory of practice. First reflections on film editing emerged as a set of recommendations for beginners on the pages of screenwriting manuals which mushroomed in the United States in the early 1910. What makes your screenplay screen-specific? Facial close-up that compensate for absent spoken lines; instant cuts instead of bulky theatrical transitions; short shots rather than lengthy scenes. Taking stock of physical, optical and temporal limitations imposed by the medium of film on actors, playwrights and directors lead to a system of continuity rules, the staple of classical Hollywood style of film narration.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As an avant-garde concept, montage was part of the European film culture of the 1920s. Specifically, Soviet montage theory emerged in an attempt to adjust narrative continuity rules from the 1910s (see Montage Theory I) to discontinuous and extra-narrative experiments in filmmaking promoted by avant-garde and peri-avant-garde directors like Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. An heir to the continuity system, Soviet montage revised and re-theorized its Hollywood heritage. Contrast rather than continuity, cuts sooner than shots, form instead of function – such, among others, were parameters of style emphasized by Soviet montage theorists throughout the twenties.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This brief study examines the genesis of the "misdiagnosis" of a fourteenth-century image that has become a frequently used representation of the Black Death on the Internet and in popular publications. The image in fact depicts another common disease in medieval Europe, leprosy, but was misinterpreted as "plague" because of a labeling error. The error was then magnified because of digital dissemination. This mistake is a reminder that interpretation of cultural products continues to demand the skills and expertise of humanists. Included is a full transcription and translation of the section of the text that the image was originally meant to illustrate: James le Palmer, Omne bonum, cap. "De clerico debilitato ministrante sequitur videre (On Ministration by a Disabled Cleric)," London, British Library, Royal 6 E. VI, vol. 2, fols. 301rb–302ra.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Gurus of Modern Yoga explores the contributions that individual gurus have made to the formation of the practices and discourses of yoga in today's world. The focus is not limited to India, but also extends to the teachings of yoga gurus in the modern, transnational world, and within the Hindu diaspora. Each of the sections deals with a different aspect of the guru within modern yoga. Included are extensive considerations of the transnational tantric guru; the teachings of modern yoga's best-known guru, T. Krishnamacharya, and those of his principal disciples; the place of technology, business, and politics in the work of global yoga gurus; and the role of science and medicine. Although the principal emphasis is on the current situation, some of the essays demonstrate the continuing influence of gurus from generations past. As a whole, the book represents an extensive and diverse picture of the place of the guru in contemporary yoga practice. (book description)</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book presents an examination of fictional representations, in books and films, of the 1947 Partition that led to the creation of the sovereign nation-states of India and Pakistan. While the process of representing the Partition experience through words and images began in the late 1940s, it is only in the last few decades that literary critics and film scholars have begun to analyse the work. The emerging critical scholarship on the Partition and its aftermath has deepened our understanding of the relationship between historical trauma, collective memory, and cultural processes, and this book provides critical readings of literary and cinematic texts on the impact of the Partition both in the Punjab and in Bengal. The collection assembles studies on Anglophone writings with those on the largely unexplored vernacular works, and those which have rarely found a place in discussions on the Partition. It looks at representations of women's experiences of gendered violence in the Partition riots, and how literary texts have filled in the lack of the 'human dimension' in Partition histories. The book goes on to highlight how the memory of the Partition is preserved, and how the creative arts' relation to public memory and its place within the public sphere has changed through time. Collectively, the essays present a nuanced understanding of how the experience of violence, displacement, and trauma shaped postcolonial societies and subjectivities in the Indian subcontinent.

		<Abstract>In late 1887 and early 1888, when Charles Sanders Peirce was drafting Chapter&amp;#x0D; IV of "A Guess at the Riddle," he was also writing about theatre and performance.&amp;#x0D; Peirce's wife Juliette had studied with the playwright, actor, and director&amp;#x0D; James Steele Mackaye (1842–1894), and Peirce hoped to see her perform on the&amp;#x0D; New York stage. Mackaye's approach to actor training drew on the speculative&amp;#x0D; philosophy of his teacher, François Delsarte. In his unfinished essay "Trichotomic"&amp;#x0D; (probably drafted in early 1888), Peirce noted with interest Mackaye's triadic&amp;#x0D; account of the actor's task, which involves the use of three capacities (sensation,&amp;#x0D; perception, and affection) to represent the corresponding categories as they&amp;#x0D; are experienced in human life. Peirce did not take up Mackaye's triads or the&amp;#x0D; speculative philosophy behind them. Yet, as Peirce notes in the above passage&amp;#x0D; from "A Guess at the Riddle," the artist's aesthetic task struck Peirce as notably&amp;#x0D; similar to that of the scientist's "genius of the mind." In these documents, Peirce&amp;#x0D; seems to treat intuition as a theatrical scene involving a double-sided act of&amp;#x0D; creation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing especially on the everyday details about the circulation of broadside ballads as narrated in Samuel Pepys's diary, 1660–1669, this essay explores the makings of ballad publics in seventeenth-century England. By ‘publics' I refer to unofficial and free forms of association based on a shared, if sometimes only roughly articulated agenda, before the rise around 1700 of what has been come to be known as the Habermasian ‘public sphere'. As Leslie P. Cormack summarizes, we must think of pre-Habermasian publics not along his model of a strictly unified (male) middle class engaged in political critique of its aristocracy but, in a less constrained way: as ‘a loose collection of people, not all of whom have personal knowledge of one another, connected by a common interest in a particular subject and with some social or political goal in mind'. By virtue of their being publics, not the public, I would add, such informal assemblages are multiple and always in the making (meaning that they can emerge and die out in an organic way). They are also capable of being stronger or weaker depending on the particular persons or circumstances or time periods involved. With this liberal definition in mind, my essay will track the making of multiple seventeenth-century English ballad publics that emerge out a shared cultural understanding across classes of the nature and function of broadside ballads. It concludes with the idea that a ballad public – or pluralistically conceived, ballad publics – consists of encircling spheres wherein strength lies closest to the center but can also arise and decrease anywhere, in any encircling sphere, on the spur of the moment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Merchant communities have come increasingly into focus as a dynamic area of academic study. This book is the first to use local primary sources to explore the interaction between foreign and native merchants in Asian countries. Contributors discuss the different economic, political and cultural conditions that gave rise to a variety of merchant communities in Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore and India. The book complements existing research on merchant communities in Europe and shows the importance of Asian mercantile communities to the growth of a global economic system. It will be of interest to economic and business historians, as well as those researching Asian and world history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A resource for all who teach and study history, this book illuminates the unmistakable centrality of American Indian history to the full sweep of American history. The nineteen essays gathered in this collaboratively produced volume, written by leading scholars in the field of Native American history, reflect the newest directions of the field and are organized to follow the chronological arc of the standard American history survey. Contributors reassess major events, themes, groups of historical actors, and approaches--social, cultural, military, and political--consistently demonstrating how Native American people, and questions of Native American sovereignty, have animated all the ways we consider the nation's past. The uniqueness of Indigenous history, as interwoven more fully in the American story, will challenge students to think in new ways about larger themes in U.S. history, such as settlement and colonization, economic and political power, citizenship and movements for equality, and the fundamental question of what it means to be an American.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The availability of digital editions of early modern works brings a wealth of exciting archival and primary source materials into the classroom. But electronic archives can be overwhelming and hard to use, for teachers and students alike, and digitization can distort or omit information about texts. Teaching Early Modern English Literature from the Archives places traditional and electronic archives in conversation, outlines practical methods for incorporating them into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, and addresses the theoretical issues involved in studying them. The volume discusses a range of physical and virtual archives from 1473 to 1700 that are useful in the teaching of early modern literature—both major sources and rich collections that are less known (including affordable or free options for those with limited institutional resources).&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Although the volume focuses on English literature and culture, essays discuss a wide range of comparative approaches involving Latin, French, Spanish, German, and early American texts and explain how to incorporate visual materials, ballads, domestic treatises, atlases, music, and historical documents into the teaching of literature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper focuses on the Morisco community that established itself in Ottoman Galata after the Expulsion from Spain in 1609. It looks at what the Morisco refugees do once they arrived in Istanbul and how they integrated into their new environment.  It considers the professional and political goals espoused by the immigrants and how they adapted to an Ottoman society that was increasingly concerned with Islamic orthodoxy.  It aims to describe the role the Moriscos played in Ottoman imperial, religious and cultural politics, both in the Mediterranean and domestically, in the "age of confessionalization"  of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Soon after the restoration of the Stuart Monarchy in 1660, English forces seized New Netherland from the Dutch, and carved it into a series of sovereign deputy sub-enterprises (colonies) on the "Proprietary" colonial model.  As the Stuart regime wobbled and then toppled in the 1680s, its policy-makers reconsidered the strategy of fragmenting the old Dutch hearth, which they were having great difficulty "Anglicizing." But rather than reassembling sovereign structures across a jumble of new colonies, they turned to a different model of regional cohesion, associated with the intervention of William Penn after 1681, which focused on creating and fostering informal and often private networks of interest groups, proprietary, imperial, and private. These webs of interest comprised a trans-Atlantic extension of Penn's almost uncanny ability in England itself to move comfortably between communities of dissent and state suppression; between the established Anglican and his own nearly outlawed Quaker church; and, at a formal political level, between the emergent and antagonistic "Whig"and "Tory" factions of the Parliamentary system.  Penn's physical health and fiscal strength faded rapidly after 1700, but the networks he had created either persevered or threw off practices, habits, and customs that became "ligaments" of a new regional order.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What, for Ralph Waldo Emerson, constitutes "family"? It is, for one, a historical sense of ancestry embodied in two centuries of New England ministers with high-minded ethics – and the aunt who invoked them, Mary Moody Emerson. It is also fraternal bonding forged in bereavement, since brothers Edward, Charles, and Bulkeley suffered some form of the family's "constitutional calamity": ambition, tuberculosis, and mental instability (JMN 3:137). The death in 1831 of first wife, Ellen Louisa Tucker, followed in succession in 1836 and 1842 by the deaths of brother Charles and Waldo, cherished son from a second marriage, devastated Emerson. These events may be credited in part for his ongoing attempt to theorize, rather than simply experience, ethical human relations, including friendship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scheduled for a 2016 release  the Companion will consist of fifty chapters by a variety of practitioners across media studies, cultural studies, game studies, new media arts, and digital humanities.  The intended audience includes advanced undergraduates as well as graduate students curious about --- among other things --- approaching old/new media computationally, conducting applied/comparative media studies research, examining the social/cultural dimensions of mediation/computation, and enacting critical theory and social justice work through new media. The overall emphasis falls on communicating key methodologies to students in the arts and humanities.  As a guide, it will instead give its contributors the opportunity to convey the relevance of their methodologies to a broad audience, with an emphasis on how arguments about media are made through new media, or how arguments about computational culture are made through computational methods. In so doing, it will survey important differences across approaches, projects, settings, styles, and perspectives, without assuming a unified voice across the contributions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Conceived of as a multicampus experiment in digital pedagogy seeking to break through the institutional barriers that, even in the age of the Internet, so often divide one university classroom from another, "Looking for Whitman: The Poetry of Place in the Life and Work of Walt Whitman" was sponsored by two Start-Up Grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Office of Digital Humanities.1 The project brought together five courses on Walt Whitman, each running concurrently at a college located in a place where Whitman himself had lived and worked, in an attempt to see how a group of distributed faculty and students could share, collaborate, research, and converse out in the open through a rich infrastructure of social media.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this book, Nadine Moeller challenges prevailing views on Egypt's nonurban past and&amp;#x0D; argues for Egypt as an early urban society. She traces the emergence of urban features&amp;#x0D; during the Predynastic Period up to the disintegration of the powerful Middle Kingdom&amp;#x0D; state (ca. 3500–1650 BCE). This book offers a synthesis of the archaeological data that&amp;#x0D; sheds light on the different facets of urbanism in ancient Egypt. Drawing on evidence&amp;#x0D; from recent excavations as well as a vast body of archaeological data, the volume explores&amp;#x0D; the changing settlement patterns by contrasting periods of strong political control against&amp;#x0D; those of decentralization. It also discusses households and the layout of domestic architecture, which are key elements for understanding how society functioned and evolved&amp;#x0D; over time. Moeller reveals what settlement patterns can tell us about the formation of&amp;#x0D; complex society and the role of the state in urban development in ancient Egypt.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Informal conversation is a practice found among speakers of every language in every culture on Earth. Or is it? Is conversation just one ofmany culturally variable speech genres, or is it the informal baseline on which all other genres are built? Can the same type of basic turn-taking system be observed in all languages, or does it vary analogously to the ways that grammatical systems do? Are conversational actions such as "asking questions" or "giving directives" present in every culture, or are these culture-specific categories based on English, meaning that other cultures have their own distinct categories? These questions are central not only to understanding language usage, but also to conceptualizing human sociality more generally. Larger social realities are built up from thousands and thousands of small-scale interactions, so a social scientist's need to understand these tiny moments is a bit like a physicist's need to understand subatomic particles. Given its fundamental nature, it is surprising that conversational interaction has, with a few notable exceptions, mainly been treated peripherally to other domains in linguistic anthropology. Reasons for this are complex, involving both disciplinary histories as well as changing technological constraints on the collection of corpora of audio/video data in many different linguistic and cultural contexts. This history is discussed in more detail below, but initially it is worth revisiting the origins of the modern-day study of talk in interaction with respect to our present questions about conversational practices across cultures.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"This new edited volume provides an innovative, empirically driven perspective on controversial facilities that will be of interest to many scholars, decision makers, and residents around the world. The volume's international perspective helps make its conclusions convincing and robust and it rests on a well developed set of theories and hypotheses." · Daniel P. Aldrich, Purdue University   NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) protests are often criticized as parochial and short-lived, generating no lasting influence on broader processes related to environmental politics. This volume offers a different perspective. Drawing on cases from around the globe, it demonstrates that NIMBY protests, although always arising from a local concern in a particular community, often result in broader political, social, and technological change. Chapters include cases from Europe, North America, and Asia, engaging with the full political spectrum from established democracies to non-democratic countries. Regardless of political setting, NIMBY movements can have a positive and proactive role in generating innovative solutions to local as well as transnational environmental issues. Furthermore, those solutions are now serving as models for communities and countries around the world.  </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nowhere is the connection between society and the environment more evident and potentially more harmful for the future of the world than in Asia. In recent decades, rapid development of Asian countries with very large populations has led to an unprecedented increase in environmental problems such as air and water pollution, solid and hazardous wastes, deforestation, depletion of natural resources and extinction of native species.   This handbook provides a comprehensive survey of the cultural, social and policy contexts of environmental change across East Asia. The team of international experts critically examine a wide range of environmental problems related to energy, climate change, air, land, water, fisheries, forests and wildlife.  The editors conclude that, with nearly half of the human population of the planet, and several rapidly growing economies, most notably China, Asian societies will determine much of the future of human impacts on the regional and global environments. As climate change-related threats to society increase, the book strongly argues for increased environmental consciousness and action in Asian societies. This handbook is a very valuable companion for students, scholars, policy makers and researchers working on environmental issues in Asia. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter highlights the development and major achievements of temple construction and engineering in the Greek East, placing them against a larger intercultural background as a foundation for further exploration of the characteristically Greek interests in theory, scale, and design. In order to more fully explore the innovations and intercultural context underlying the reshaping of the environment in Archaic Ionia, the chapter focuses on the all-marble, truly Ionic Artemision at Ephesos and the Tunnel of Eupalinos at Samos. The most complete evidence for such engineering pertains to the truly gigantic Kroisos Temple at Ephesos. As in Archaic Ionian temple architecture, the tunnel of Eupalinos is perhaps best understood against the larger context of fluid intercultural knowledge and traditions made possible by the tensions and shared achievements of the recently dissolved Neo-Assyrian world, but created at a larger scale with great skill and innovation</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Along with Ionian abstract thinkers like Anaximander in the sixth century BCE, Archaic architects were the earliest Greek prose writers. Whereas Anaximander and others wrote about the nature of the universe, architects like Theodoros, Chersiphron, and Metagenes wrote about their discoveries and successes in the sphere of building construction. In the theory of Hellenistic architects focused on questions of design, there developed an interest in scale, which enabled the design of buildings through graphic means for the envisioning of buildings from the abstract, disembodied aerial view of ground plans. With extensive reference to the Didymaion, this chapter explores scale planning in Hellenistic architectural theory as reflected in Vitruvius. The theoretical processes and principles scale design developed first in traditional methods of construction that preceded common application of reduced scale in the art of building, which was unlikely to have taken place prior to Hermogenes in the later third century BCE.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The paper aims to reassess the meaning of Iron Age tumuli in central Lydia, western Turkey, and especially in the area of Bin Tepe, thought to be the Lydian royal cemetery.  Invoking scholarship on shared and collective memories and citing both the discovery of a Bronze Age kingdom in the basin of the Gygaean Lake (modern Marmara Golu) and the sacred significance of the area deriving from the cyclic fluctuation of its water bodies, we suggest Lydian kings selected Bin Tepe for burial to associate themselves with and co-opt local memories of heroes and sacred meanings.  Bin Tepe is thus considered from the perspective of the significance of its natural and conceptual landscapes.  The meanings and memories of Bin Tepe in post-Lydian through recent times are assessed briefly, stressing its dynamic valuing as it was exploited for treasures and strategic qualities in war, plunder, and agriculture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Ottoman term for a historical work, tarih, can sometimes be misleading to students of history.  Modern scholarship replicates the Ottoman use of the term and regards virtually all works with narratives of events as 'history;' little distinction is made between the various types of Ottoman historical writing.  Yet, from a modern perspective used to modern definitions and taxonomies within the discipline of history, seeing the label applied to a variety of Ottoman historical productions is confusing, both with regard to the topics, and to the time period that they cover.  To the modern mind, pamphlets and monographs justifying a political position, glorifying campaigns, eulogizing statesmen, or investigating controversial current events would be regarded as reportage, propaganda, political analysis, or some combination thereof.  The Ottoman mind, however, classified all such works under the rubric of history.  A closer look to better understand the array of Ottoman historical works will not only illuminate us with regard to the Ottoman conceptions of historiography, but also allow us to conduct an adequate analysis of the contents of Ottoman histories.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Like European writers in countries devastated by World War II, early Turkish republican writers took up the pen amidst the ruins of the occupied Ottoman Empire to fortify the will and courage of the nationalist forces gearing up to push back the enemy.  Holding day jobs as teachers, journalists, and civil servants, these writers saw education and educational reform as the only panacea for the new Turkish republic at the time of its birth and with the onset of growing pains.  The not unjustified anti-nationalist rhetoric of contemporary Turkish celebrity novelists, such as Orhan Pamuk and Elif Safak, has led to a certain neglect of the work of early republican writers, who were the intellectual architects of the young nation.  While their work has lost its former resonance in critical discourse on modern Turkish literature and literary history, viewed in historical context and in terms of literary appeal and social insight this oeuvre has proven to be both prescient and rigorously discerning of the trials of Turkish modernity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the second half of the seventeenth century a great upheaval occurred in the Ukrainian territories of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that led to the unraveling and eventual transformation of the international order in Eastern Europe.  For more than a generation the revolt against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and ensuing conflicts drew in most near and distant neighbors - in particular the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean Khanate, Moldavia, Transylvania, among others.  This whirlwind of events eventually brought the Ottoman Empire and Muscovy into their first major military conflict.  By the late 1660s the Ottomans felt compelled to engage in an active policy, leading to struggle and negotiation for control of the steppe region north of the Black Sea.  &amp;#x0D; This essay provides an interpretation and better understanding of the Ukrainian-Ottoman encounter during this turbulent and pivotal period, using key primary sources as well as essential secondary literature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historian Karen Leal re-charts the multiethnicity of Istanbul's Balat district, with its layered Byzantine Greek and Jewish identity.  She carefully integrates court records and travelers' accounts with architectural analysis, observations, and interviews with former residents.  In so doing, she challenges the institutional nature and essentializing impact of the Ottoman millet system on daily urban life by evoking "the fluidity of the social makeup of the district and the continual ongoing transformations among the various communities that characterized life in Balat prior to the nineteenth century."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the middle of the seventeenth century, Bohdan Khmelnytsky was the legendary Cossack general who organized a rebellion that liberated the Eastern Ukraine from Polish rule. Consequently, he has been memorialized in the Ukraine as a God-given nation builder, cut in the model of George Washington. But in this campaign, the massacre of thousands of Jews perceived as Polish intermediaries was the collateral damage, and in order to secure the tentative independence, Khmelnytsky signed a treaty with Moscow, ultimately ceding the territory to the Russian tsar. So, was he a liberator or a villain? This volume examines drastically different narratives, from Ukrainian, Jewish, Russian, and Polish literature, that have sought to animate, deify, and vilify the seventeenth-century Cossack. Khmelnytsky's legacy, either as nation builder or as antagonist, has inhibited inter-ethnic and political rapprochement at key moments throughout history and, as we see in recent conflicts, continues to affect Ukrainian, Jewish, Polish, and Russian national identity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume gathers the contributions of senior and junior scholars—all indebted to the pathbreaking work of Derek Pearsall—to showcase new research prompted by his rich and ongoing legacy as a literary critic, editor, and seminal founder of Middle English manuscript studies. The contributors aim both to honor Pearsall's work in the field he established and to introduce the complexities of interdisciplinary manuscript studies to students already familiar with medieval literature.  The contributors explore a range of issues, from the study of medieval literary manuscripts to the history of medieval books, libraries, literacy, censorship, and the social classes who used the books and manuscripts—nobles, children, schoolmasters, priests, merchants, and more. In addressing reading practices, essays provide a wealth of information on marginal commentaries, images and interpretive methods, international transmission, and early print and editorial methods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collaborative literary history of Europe, the first yet attempted, unfolds through ten sequences of places linked by trade, travel, topography, language, pilgrimage, alliance, disease, and artistic exchange. The period covered, 1348-1418, provides deep context for understanding current developments in Europe, particularly as initiated by the destruction and disasters of World War II. We begin with the greatest of all European catastrophes: the 1348 bubonic plague, which killed one person in three. Literary cultures helped speed recovery from this unprecedented "ground zero" experience, providing solace, distraction, and new ideals to live by. Questions of where Europe begins and ends, then as now, and disputes over whom truly "belongs" on European soil are explored, if not solved, through writing.   A war that would last for a century convulsed much of western Europe. Divisions between Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christianities endured, and in 1378 the West divided again between popes of Avignon and Rome. Arabic literary cultures linked Fes and Granada to Jerusalem and Damascus; Persian and Turkish writings began to flourish south and west of Constantinople; Jewish intellectuals treasured Arabic texts as well as Hebrew writings; Armenian colophons proved unique. From 1414-18 western nations gathered to heal their papal schism while also exchanging literary, humanist, and musical ideas; visitors from the East hoped for commitment to wider European peace. Freed from nation state historiography, as bequeathed by the nineteenth century, these 82 chapters freshly assess the free movement of European literature in all its variety, local peculiarity, and regenerative power.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Manuscripts vary in composition, script, hand, layout, design, color, numbering, and material, among other factors. Such variations reveal literary material not included in editions and also provide fundamental evidence for cultural and intellectual history. Variations and remarkable features of manuscripts in the Indic collections of Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania were discovered and annotated using the Sanskrit Image-Text Alignment software (SITA), developed in the NEH-funded project, ``Enhancing Access to Primary Cultural Heritage Materials of India''. The annotations allow systematic access to numerous types of remarkable features for the purpose of research and education.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sanskrit, the classical language of India, presents specific challenges for computational linguistics: exact phonetic transcription in writing that obscures word boundaries, rich morphology and an enormous corpus, among others. Recent international cooperation has developed innovative solutions to these problems and significant resources for linguistic research. Solutions include efficient segmenting and tagging algorithms and dependency parsers based on constraint programming. The integration of lexical resources, text archives and linguistic software is achieved by distributed interoperable Web services. Resources include a morphological tagger and tagged corpus.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper treats Reid's claim that beauty consists in expression of mental excellence.  I reconstruct his two major arguments for this claim: an inductive survey of objects actually found beautiful and an argument that only in this way can one satisfy the demands of aesthetic realism, the grounds for which are also discussed. I argue further that Reid's expressivism (like his realism itself) also attempts to capture the phenomenology of experiences of beauty: as of a value beyond ourselves, which leads us to investigate the object further or to aspire to attain that value ourselves.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past few decades, spatial technologies, including satellite imagery, GPS, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, and (more recently) 3D modeling have substantially transformed archaeology1 and these developments are having an increasing influence in Egyptology. As tools of spatial visualization and analysis become more affordable, accessible, and easily integrated into archaeological research, we argue that more explicit consideration of their roles and impacts specifically within Egyptology is advisable. The following work presents a brief summary of select spatial technologies and potential applications in Egyptology. For each, current applications, some of the major resources available, and possible future uses are discussed. We do not intend to provide a comprehensive review of all pertinent technologies, but instead a brief introductory description of a few key innovations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The chapter explores the impact of long-term incarceration on an intersection of character, rational agency, and the ability to participate successfully in the civil society of a liberal polity. The chief claims are that (i) the concept character does, indeed, have explanatory and ethical significance, and (ii) prevailing conditions of long-term incarceration in the U.S. and U.K. often harm and worsen prisoners through their impact on dispositions constitutive of character. While a liberal polity should not require individuals to acquire virtues, neither should it cause them to have vices (or worsen their vices) in known and regular ways. The ways that prison conditions have that result are considered, along with the respects in which this disables ex-prisoners for reentering society. The relations between states of character and capacities for prudential self-determination are an important focus of the analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay examines the significance of the racially distinctive appropriations of Joe Louis' image.  The deadpan expression for which Louis became known provoked wild speculation about the man himself. More importantly, it allowed viewers to imprint their own interpretation of race onto the supposedly blank canvass of his face. White people assuaged their fears about a black man pummeling white men into the ropes by shaping Louis into a known, stereotypical black boy/man: a chicken-eating, lazy simpleton. They analyzed and unpacked his demeanor until they assured themselves that his blank face did not reflect anything sinister but instead, mindlessness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On the cusp of America's involvement in World War II, many white Americans embraced heavyweight boxer Joe Louis as a heroic and popular figure. In this article, Sacks argues that by doing so, whites could assert a triumphal message about race in the United States. Despite the deep entrenchment of Jim Crow segregation, celebrating a black man permitted whites to insist that neither race nor racism restricted black people from their aspirations. Louis's popularity offered the seed for a nascent paradigm of racial ideology that saw full germination in the neo-conservative movement of the 1980s and beyond.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Daoist classics had a profound impact on Japanese literature, but English studies of this influence have been scarce. This chapter sheds light on this area by examining the role Daoist classic Zhuangzi played in the development of Japanese haikai—the matrix of modern haiku—during the latter half of the seventeenth century. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; When haikai became a popular genre of linked verse in the seventeenth century, haikai poets faced paradoxical demands. On the one hand, they had to break the conventions of the classical linked verse in order to reach a popular audience, on the other hand, they needed codified poetic signifiers and intertextual structures from the classical tradition to elevate haikai's vernacular language to poetic art. This chapter locates haikai's encounter with the Zhuangzi in the intersection of the deconstructing and reconstructing of the canonical traction. It provides a hermeneutic reading of the intertextual relations between haikai compositions and the Daoist texts, as well as an in-depth analyses of key terms that have been instrumental in reconstructing haikai's poetic essence. Through examining the works of Japan's greatest haikai poet Matsuo Basho (1664-1694), it shows how the Zhuangzi helped turn the parodic and vernacular haikai into a high art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Relational theories of normative language allegedly face special problems in accounting for the extent of disagreement, but this is everybody's problem because normative sentences are relativized to different information in contexts of deliberation and advice.  This paper argues that a relational theory provides a pragmatic solution that accounts for some disagreements as involving inconsistent preferences rather than beliefs.  This is shown to be superior to the semantic solution offered by expressivists like Allan Gibbard, as it accounts for a wider range of disagreements, explains a puzzling asymmetry, and avoids the expressivist's problem with negation.  This pragmatic account extends to fundamental disagreements involving preferences for different ends.  Three different kinds of normative disagreement are distinguished: instrumental, rational, and outright.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article focuses on Afro-Argentine swing guitarist Oscar Alemán, who leveraged his phenotypical blackness and his musical talent in order to build a career that took him from Brazil to Buenos Aires to Paris and back to the Argentine capital. Over the course of his career, Alemán performed multiple black identities, responding creatively to his audiences' varied racial expectations. In the Parisian nightclubs of the 1930s, being black gave him a certain cachet.  Similarly, once he returned to Buenos Aires in 1940, his racial identity strengthened his claim to being Argentina's most authentic jazz musician. Yet as a black jazz musician, he challenged ideas about Argentine national identity in ways that ultimately limited his career horizons. Alemán's commercial success in Argentina during the 1940s and 1950s problematizes simplistic accounts of Argentine racism. Nevertheless, his association with a version of blackness that alluded to Brazilian tropicalism and Parisian nightlife eventually limited his appeal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The chapter "examines the maps of exile and diaspora created by contemporary Argentine visual artist Mirta Kupferminc as works of postmemory. A child of Holocaust survivors, Kupferminc draws literal and figurative maps of the trajectories of exile, including a series of maps that she embroiders on her hands. Her work invokes and marks the body […] as a site of intergenerational trauma and memory offered up to a viewer complicit in working out the many ways that meaning is made in the charting of visual space as a visceral and aesthetic project."

		<Abstract>This article is part of a larger project in which I exploring how the Stone Age was made in Dutch New Guinea by examining the relationship between affect and technology.  I focus on the experience of influential individuals: officials who promoted the policy that led to the "primitive" territory's continued colonization following World War II.  These officials began their careers leading expeditions into the territory's interior in the 1930s.  In doing so, they found themselves unsettled by their dependence on local people and their technologies, along with the assemblage of equipment, supplies, and personnel that made up what I have called the "trekking machine."  Daily life on these journeys blurred the boundaries between colonizers and colonized, not to mention New Guinea's erstwhile rulers and their tools.   The technological performances I explore in this paper intervene to redraw a sharp line.  By demonstrating the power of instruments ranging from gramophones to rifles to airplanes, Dutch officials sought to augment and define their own agency, which they associated with the modern world.  These demonstrations went hand in hand with encounters in which they sought to put Papuan technologies on display – and display Papuans as both caught in the past and uncannily capable of progress, albeit only with the tutelage of benevolent Dutch masters.  Predictably, these demonstrations often backfired.  But as significant as their failure are the forces that led to the staging of these dramas of inter-temporal encounter – and fed the image of New Guinea as caught in another time.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter compares conditional verdicts that were issued by judicial courts in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods.

		<Abstract>Influential twentieth-century philosophers and mathematicians turned philosophers leapt upon new theories of representation, meaning, judgment, arithmetic and sets elaborated during the late 19th century to remodel, if not all together eliminate, many traditional ideas about what Bertrand Russell once colorfully called the ultimate furniture of the universe. One of the principal strategies adopted by Russell, Rudolf Carnap, Willard Van Orman Quine and like-minded philosophers was to use logic to throw out the old furniture and replace it with new furniture of their liking. The full implications of those new theories about the ultimate structure of reality have yet to be drawn because, for many reasons, many avenues of research have yet to be pursued. Here, I wish to add new dimensions to standard discussions by looking at the ontological implications for analytic philosophy of Edmund Husserl's theory that numbers and sets function in an entirely different way in the sphere of propositions and states of affairs than in arithmetic and in set theory</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Groundwork is lain for answering questions as to how to situate Husserl's theory of functions in relation to Frege's. I examine Husserl's ideas about analyticity and mathematics, logic and mathematics, formalization, calculating with concepts and propositions, the foundations of arithmetic, extensions to show that, although he knew, studied and lauded Frege's ideas about functions and concepts, each man approached the issues from different angles. Seduced by the siren of transcendental phenomenology Husserl did not pursue the issues, implications, and consequences of his ideas about functions. I ask whether so doing could provide new insight into, or even solutions to, the problems involving functions that beset Frege, Russell and have beset their successors.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>for a number of reasons, Husserl's strategy for keeping knowledge of reality from collapsing into a formless blob of facts became buried in all the excitement, both positive and negative, generated by his transcendental phenomenology, and so its implications for logic and philosophy nowadays have barely been explored. Fortunately though, since the 1980s, the Husserl Archives has been publishing the material we need to recuperate Husserl's blueprint for discovering the underlying objective structure of reality as he saw and conveyed it. I endeavor to outline Husserl's prescription for finding clarity with respect to the central traits of reality. In particular, I seek to disinter the parts and members of the categorial skeleton designed by Husserl to uphold knowledge in a way that stands in sharp contrast to the logical point of view that has underpropped phenomenology's rival school of thought, analytic philosophy, of which Quine was one of the foremost exponents.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Husserl and Cantor were colleagues and close friends during the last fourteen years of the 19th century, when Cantor was at the height of his creative powers and Husserl in the throes of an intellectual struggle during which he drew apart from people and writings to whom he owed most of his intellectual training and drew closer to the ideas of thinkers whose writings he had not been able to evaluate properly and had consulted too little. I study ways in which Husserl and Cantor might be said to have been alike, while pointing to dissimilarities between them. In particular, I discuss how their ideas overlapped and crisscrossed with regard to mathematics and philosophy, Platonic idealism, abstraction, empiricism, psychologism, actual consciousness and pure logic, Frege's reviews of their works, metaphysics and mysticism, sets, arithmetization, strange and imaginary numbers and manifolds. I conclude that Cantor was among those of his mentors from whose ideas Husserl drew away and Lotze and Bolzano were among those to whose ideas he drew closer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The article addresses the issue of agency of the local perpetrators in Romania-occupied southern Ukraine. Based on the communist-era investigative from Romania and the Soviet Union, the author claims that both the Jewish survivors of mass executions and Christians eyewitnesses of them were aware of substantial differences between various perpetrators. All eyewitness distinguished between zealous fanatics, evaders, and compliers; they also often clearly characterized perpetrators depending on their degree of moral depravity. Traditional gender roles also played into the perception of female perpetrators as particularly vicious. The dynamic of gender roles was also evident in that female members of male perpetrators' families were both intended beneficiaries of their looting of Jewish possessions and sometimes scolded their men for their savagery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Rivero (1994) makes a distinction between true imperatives (imperatives with unique morphology) and surrogate imperatives (imperatives that make use of the morphology of other moods or features). For negative commands, some languages use true imperative with negation and others use surrogate imperatives. Zejlstra (2004) attempts to capture this phenomenon in an interesting generalization, namely, that only languages in which the negative is X° impose a ban on true negative imperative. This paper reviews this generalization in the light of data from Tanzanian Bantu languages of Kikisi, Kindendeule, Chingoni, and Kimatuumbi, all of which have postverbal negative clitic and use surrogate negative. The particles are ndali (Kikisi), yee (Kindendeule), hee (Chingoni) and lí (Kimatuumbi). The data show that the negative particles exhibit distributional features of adverbs. This paper argues that the post-verbal position of the particle is a result of movement of the verb to a position higher than the adjunction position of the negative. As an adverb, it does not prevent the verb from moving across. This accounts for why in spite of being in post-verbal position, it takes scope over the preceding predicate. The languages in this study do not have a true negative imperative. The verb morphology used for imperative cannot combine with negation to express a negative command. Instead, a negative command is expressed by the prohibitive      –somu (Kikisi), -koto (Kindendeule and Chingoni)  ‘stop' and –kotoka  (Kimatuumbi) ‘do not do' together with an infinitive form of the main verb. Kindendeule also allows an infinitive verb followed by the negative particle yee. The paper argues that the ban on negative imperative is due to the adjunction occurring too low to have scope over the illocutionary force in ForceP.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>‘Introspection' is a term used by philosophers to refer to a special method or means by which one comes to know certain of one's own mental states; specifically, one's current conscious states. It derives from the Latin ‘spicere', meaning ‘look', and ‘intra', meaning ‘within'; introspection is a process of looking inward. Introspectionist accounts of self-knowledge fall within the broader domain of theories of self-knowledge, understood as views about the nature of and basis for one's knowledge of one's own mental states, including one's beliefs, desires, conscious thinkings, and sensations. Theories of self-knowledge are motivated by the apparent need to account for a number of striking features of at least some such knowledge, which ordinary empirical knowledge, including knowledge of the mental states of others, is typically thought to lack.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My book chapter reconstructs Parra's more commercially-oriented musical activities prior to her emergence as a folklorista in the early 1950s. It notes if and why Violeta jettisoned the artistic pathways of her  teenage years through her early thirties upon embarking on her career as a folklorist. The chapter pays particular attention to the sexual politics of her work as a cantante popular [popular singer] and to the ways in which she challenged them, to some -- if limited -- success.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article examines two thirteenth-century vernacular religious texts dedicated to two neighboring Ponthevin ruling countesses: the paraphrase of the Pater Noster dedicated to Ide de Boulogne and the allegory of the redemption known as the Quatre Sereurs written for the countess of Ponthieu.  The two texts share not only the fact of female patronage, and geography, they also share family connection (two brothers married the two counties' heiresses) and a manuscript context, for they both occur in the related compilations BNF fr. 12467 and Arsenal 3142 (as well as in other manuscripts).  In addition, both manuscripts, and in particular Arsenal 3142, have close associations with another female literary patron, Marie de Brabant.  This article examines these two texts in their historical and manuscript contexts, looking at the evidence for and results of female patronage in both texts and manuscripts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Duke Ellington is widely held to be the greatest jazz composer and one of the most significant cultural icons of the twentieth century. This comprehensive and accessible Companion is the first collection of essays to survey, in depth, Ellington's career, music, and place in popular culture. An international cast of authors includes renowned scholars, critics, composers, and jazz musicians. Organized in three parts, the Companion first sets Ellington's life and work in context, providing new information about his formative years, method of composing, interactions with other musicians, and activities abroad; its second part gives a complete artistic biography of Ellington; and the final section is a series of specific musical studies, including chapters on Ellington and song-writing, the jazz piano, descriptive music, and the blues. Featuring a chronology of the composer's life and major recordings, this book is essential reading for anyone with an interest in Ellington's enduring artistic legacy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines the attachment of concepts of cultural and linguistic Arabness to the Mahri language spoken in Yemen. He examines a body of literature that claims a "Himyarite" (Yemeni) origin for the Berber languages of North Africa, particularly among the Berber-speaking Touareg in Tunisia. I suggest that this narrative is built not on linguistic evidence but on pre-modern historical intersections between the Touareg and the Mahra, perhaps focused around camel trading – an activity that by the modern period carried positive connotations of Arab and Bedouin cultural authenticity. Despite its evident falsity, then, the linguistic theories linking Berber and Mahri allow both minority groups to claim a kind of cultural "Arabian authenticity" that carries political benefits in both the Yemeni and the Tunisian North African contexts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The early Academics, notoriously, counseled total epokhê.  We must suspend judgment with regard to matters on which we cannot be certain.  It is rash to do otherwise; the sage will never have mere opinions.  Some later Academics, also notoriously, counseled that a modest and cautious acceptance of what seems most reasonable or probable is the right course of action; the sage will on occasion opine.  A good deal of controversy persists regarding the proper interpretation of these alternatives. Although the scholarly disputes have significantly advanced our understanding of the possible and plausible if not actual positions maintained by the Academics, I believe one crucial fact has not received adequate attention:  our most important source for these positions, Cicero, appears to be committed to both in the Academica.&amp;#x0D; I argue that in the Academica, Cicero does not see these alternatives as contradictory.  Rather, despite some appearances to the contrary, he maintains a consistently fallibilist view of Academic methodology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The project of global art history calls for balanced treatment of artifacts and a unified approach. This volume emphasizes questions of transcultural encounters and exchanges as circulations. It presents a strategy that highlights the processes and connections among cultures, and also responds to the dynamics at work in the current globalized art world. The editors' introduction provides an account of the historical background to this approach to global art history, stresses the inseparable bond of theory and practice, and suggests a revaluation of materialist historicism as an underlying premise. Individual contributions to the book provide an overview of current reflection and research on issues of circulation in relation to global art history and the globalization of art past and present. They offer a variety of methods and approaches to the treatment of different periods, regions, and objects, surveying both questions of historiography and methodology and presenting individual case studies. An 'Afterword' by James Elkins gives a critique of the present project. The book thus deliberately leaves discussion open, inviting future responses to the large questions it poses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The chapter provides a preliminary analysis of evidence given by German prisoners of war in the court of justice in Pau during the trials of suspected collaborators. I explore the ways in which the post-liberation authorities assessed and utilized that evidence, and how German POWs created positions of power for themselves both during and after the Occupation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Benito Pérez Galdós's second series of Episodios nacionales in particular reveals a concern with Spain's colonial history, directly referencing American territorial losses during the reign of Fernando VII. In "Realism, Fantasy and the Gendered Trope of Colonial Relations in Galdós's Fiction," Mary Coffey argues that in this series, written from 1875 to 1879, Galdós attempts to mitigate the trauma of the nation's imperial decline through the creation of a new metropolitan foundational fiction that allegorizes an acceptance of diminished status. Yet the literary realism employed with success early in his career proves inadequate for the subject matter of post-1898 metropolitan/colonial relations, and in 1909, when Galdós writes El caballero encantado, he turns to the crafting of a cuento inverosímil for his fantastic portrait of imperial reconciliation. Notably, in both the family romance of his early fiction and the dreamlike fantasy of his later work, Galdós's treatment of Spanish colonialism constitutes varying forms of metropolitan wish fulfillment. At the core of his allegorical representations at both points in his career is the traditional gendered trope of metropolis and colony. From Salvador Monsalud's affair with an indianilla in the second series of Episodios to the complex courtship of a Spanish nobleman and a Colombian heiress in El caballero encantado, Galdós attempts to provoke a re-assessment of Spanish imperial history through the prism of gender relations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper examines how bishops in north-central Italy during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries challenged the new canonization process by supporting local cults in the face of official opposition.  Bishops often identified with local rather than papal interests in a bid to assert their autonomy and their traditional prerogative to determine sanctity.  Bishops thus often championed the cults of individuals, whom popes or papal agents considered suspect or unworthy of veneration, often incurring a reprimand in return.  This phenomenon can be observed in the examples of Bishop Alberto Prandoni of Ferrara, who spearheaded canonization efforts for the sentenced heretic Armanno Pungilupo; of Bishop Rainaldo IV of Ascoli, who supported the thrice-condemned local holy man Meco of Ascoli; Bishops Obizzo of Parma and Rolando Taverna of Spoleto, who protected Gerardo Segarelli (ultimately burned as a relapsed heretic); as well as the bishops of Parma, Reggio-Emilia, and Cremona who countenanced the veneration of Albert of Villa d'Ogna.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The nineteenth century - the Era of the Interior - witnessed the steady displacement of art from the ceilings,  walls, and floors of aristocratic and religious interiors to the everyday spaces of bourgeois households, subject to their own enhanced ornamentation. Following the 1863 Salon des refuses, the French State began to channel mediocre painters into the decorative arts. England, too, launched an extensive reform of the decorative arts, resulting in more and more artists engaged in the production and design of complete interiors.  America soon followed. Present art historical scholarship - still indebted to a modernist discourse that sees cultural progress to be synonymous with the removal of ornament from both utilitarian objects and architectural spaces - has not yet acknowledged the importance of the decorative arts in the myriad interior spaces of the 1800s. Nor has mainstream art history reckoned with the importance of the interior in nineteenth-century life and thought. Aimed at an interdisciplinary audience, including art and design historians, historians of the modern interior, interior designers, visual culture theorists, and scholars of nineteenth-century material culture, this collection of essays studies the modern interior in new ways. The  volume addresses the double nature of the modern interior as both space and image, blurring the boundaries between arts and crafts, decoration and high art, two-dimensional and three-dimensional design, trompe-l'oeil effects and spatial practices. In so doing, it redefines the modern interior and its objects as essential components of modern art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Focusing on the Caribe Hilton (1949) and the Havana Riviera (1957) as case studies, this essay underscores the role modern furniture and modern hotel design played in shaping notions of place and national identity. In the 1950s, San Juan and Havana were two of the most popular international destinations for Americans, and the new hotels built in these cities were significant displays of modern architecture and design, impressing tourists and locals alike. Design and tourism converged in these hotels to create cultural contact zones that shaped American tourists' and the local populations' attitudes about cultural identity and international and local politics.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Considering both U.S. and insular sources, this essay underscores how hotel design, and the discourses surrounding it, were often adopted and manipulated by various agents, including local governments, private operators, guests, and the local population, to promote or contest contemporaneous debates surrounding issues of national identity, U.S.-insular relations, and the politics of tourism. These debates often hinged on notions of the modern and modernization, the historic or traditional, and concepts of the tropics. The Caribe Hilton demonstrates the Puerto Rican government's bold move to finance a strikingly modern hotel, which served as a symbol of the island's modernization program and promoted the use of avant-garde modernism in hotel design around the world. The Havana Riviera showcased the cosmopolitan nature of Havana in the 1950s, in which design represented the way in which Cuban culture carefully blended modernity and tradition. Concluding with a brief examination of the contemporary status of these hotels, this essay points to the ways the histories of these designs are shaped over time according to changing attitudes revolving around the topics of politics, international relations, tourism, and national identity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article addresses several of the findings from my project on Pierre Viret's correspondence. It explains the origin of the critical edition and several of the key findings from the new letters. For example, the letters help shed light on the functioning of the Lausanne Academy, the intra-Protestant quarrels Viret had with people like André Zébédée and Jérôme Bolsec, and Viret's efforts to assist the Lausanne students who were eventually burned at the stake in France.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Qing Encounters: Artistic Exchanges between China and the West examines how the contact between China and Europe in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries transformed the arts on both sides of the East- West divide. The essays in the volume reveal the extent to which images, artifacts, and natural specimens were traded and copied, and how these materials inflected both cultures' visions of novelty and pleasure, battle and power, and ways of seeing and representing. Artists and craftspeople on both continents borrowed and adapted forms, techniques, and modes of representation, producing deliberate, meaningful, and complex new creations. By considering this reciprocity from both Eastern and Western perspectives, Qing Encounters offers a new and nuanced understanding of this critical period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In "‘And These Things Follow': Teleology, Necessity, and Explanation in Aristotle's Meteorologica," Margaret Scharle argues that while teleology is not mentioned in the Meteorologica, it is implicitly presupposed there. In particular, the Meteorologica's explanations depend on Aristotle's view that there are two elemental cycles, an earth–?re cycle and an air–water cycle, which Aristotle ultimately explains in terms of teleological processes outside of the Meteorologica. Scharle argues that Aristotle's procedure in explaining meteorology is just what one would expect from Parts of Animals i.1 and his practice in the biological works:he is examining the necessary byproducts of teleological processes. The difference between biological and meteorological cases, she argues, is that in biology the organism can make use of necessary by-products to further the organism's ends. By contrast, there is no way for the elements to make use of necessary by-products to further their ends because they are entirely passive and have no parts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter is a cultural study of St Paul's Cathedral precinct in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. It discusses the physical properties of Paul's, including the nave, Paul's Cross pulpit, the bookshops in the churchyard, and the many and varied uses and occupations of the precinct and church, including sermons, secular business practices, and criminal activity. While recent scholarship has attended to various discreet spaces in and around the cathedral, this chapter discusses the religious and secular space and activities as mutually constitutive rather than distinct. Influenced by studies of cultural geography, the chapter investigates the role of the cathedral precinct in constructing the identity of the early modern Londoner through a discussion of the effects that geographical space has on human behaviour.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the late 16th century, the phrase 'to make Paul's work' of something became colloquial for a botched or an always unfinished project. The phrase has its origins in the sustained yet unsuccessful efforts to repair and renovate London's St.Paul's Cathedral after the 1561 fire that destroyed the spire and damaged the roof. The church fell into disrepair in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries and was the subject of several reconstruction attempts, none of which came to fruition. It was not until Charles I took the throne that a complete restoration of the church, led by Inigo Jones, was planned. This chapter is an attempt to weave together the sometimes competing narratives surrounding the renovation efforts in the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods. The author uses those royal qualifiers deliberately, as the monarchs were generally involved in attempts at refurbishing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In early- and mid-nineteenth- century Rio de Janeiro, the setting sun daily triggered a legal regime distinct from the one that prevailed in daylight. Across time, Brazilian legal codes and law enforcement officials invoked the inability to "see a man's face" after dark to impose dramatic restrictions on public rights and to differentiate between persons who were ostensibly equal before the law. Considering how the law apprehends the daily cycle of darkness and light, this essay demonstrates how criminal law and its agents relied on human sight not just to garner evidence and patrol the streets but also to justify a nightly suspension of rights, from Brazil's independence in the 1820s through the early twentieth century when electrical lighting penetrated the capital city, and beyond. From the nineteenth-century statutes that made reference to the night as a juridically distinct time to the curfews that went into effect at nightfall to keep order in the city (with a particular focus on errant slaves and their alleged companions and collaborators), the way the law treated the daily transition to darkness changed over time. Yet one can also trace fascinating consistencies in the sociolegal construction of nighttime over the course of the long nineteenth century. What, this essay asks, were the social, cultural, and legal effects of this nightly state of emergency? And how do the legal justifications for, public debates about, and violations of the curfew bring to light assumptions about visual perception already built into the law in nineteenth-century Brazil?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay analyzes how Gabriel García Márquez's 1981 novella Crónica de una muerte anunciada (Chronicle of a Death Foretold), which narrates a small town honor-killing involving a Levantine Arab immigrant, resonated with the prominent Lebanese author Elias Khoury (Ilyas Khuri).  Khoury's 1994 novel Majma‘ al-Asrar (The collection of secrets) is at once an homage to García Márquez's narrative techniques and a corrective commentary on the forms of Orientalism, or discursive violence, that linger in Crónica.  In Majma‘ al-Asrar, Khoury, while commenting on these Orientalist tensions, also looks beyond them to use Crónica to attempt to understand violence and the narrative act in South Atlantic contexts. This textual encounter demonstrates that contact across the South Atlantic-Southern Mediterranean corridor must attend to the vestiges of imperialist and neo-colonial dynamics in order to avoid the reproduction of various forms of violence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sensational reports of free love and the "nationalization of women" under the Bolsheviks revealed the way in which American anxieties were filtered through critiques of Bolshevik morality. But U.S. new women visiting the "new Russia" in the 1920s and 1930s not only praised the Bolsheviks' "new morality"— efforts to make women full members of society and an ideal of comradely love—they also experienced sexual awakenings, physically embodying their political desire. This essay draws upon fictional and journalistic accounts of Russia's new morality from the 1920s and 1930s alongside archival evidence of real or imagined affairs involving travelers to the Soviet Union. The U.S. Left's association of Soviet Russia with sexual possibility and female empowerment continued longer than it could in the Soviet Union itself.</Abstract>

Further, in this group there is an extension of the role of spouses and families as sources of stability and unremunerated support and care, and an increasingly explicit acknowledgment of the demands that multiple deployments place on family life. Through personal narratives and participant observation, the authors portray the costs of war on soldiers, their families, and their communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Davidson's account of mental causation initiated in ‘Mental Events' forms a backdrop to much subsequent discussion of the topic. Davidson is commonly taken to defend token identity—token mental events are identical with token physical events—but type diversity—mental types ‘supervene on', but are not reducible to or identical with physical types, where types are understood as properties. Mental events are physical events, but one and the same event can have a physical property and, by virtue of having this property, have a mental property as well. There are two salient difficulties with this account. (1) It gives rise to the problem of ‘causal relevance': granted that a mental event can cause a physical event, could it do so by virtue of being mental, by virtue of its possession of a mental property? (2) The view thus described is not Davidson's. This paper discusses Davidson actual account and shows that, whatever its flaws, they are not what they are commonly thought to be.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Western Pantar (ISO 639-3 code lev) is spoken by an estimated 10,804 people on the southwestern portion of Pantar, west of the Sirung volcanic massif. The dry region of western Pantar is separated from the northern peninsula of the island by a physical barrier consisting of a number of steep-walled canyons. No road yet connects the northern peninsula with the western part of the island. In most of the academic literature the language is referred to as Lamma, though that name more properly refers to only a single dialect of the language. This description is based on first-hand field work by the author between 2004 and 2010.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter traces the racialization of Asian Americans in the years since the advent of affirmative action in the 1960s United States. I argue that Asian Americans came to be considered an "overrepresented" minority group and therefore generally ineligible for inclusion in affirmative action programs. At the same time, Asian Americans themselves protested this exclusion, arguing that they were indeed bona fide "minorities" entitled to affirmative action protections. Since 2000, increasing numbers of Asian Americans have protested their characterization as unfair and have simultaneously argued for the elimination of affirmative action in college admissions. The history of the "overrepresentation" concept illuminates the centrality of proportionality thinking and statistical data in US race-making since the 1960s.  "Overrepresentation" calls into question—if not upending altogether—reigning approaches to representation, fairness, and racial justice at the dawn of the twenty-first century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Antov looks at what was arguably the most complex region of all for inter-faith relations, the Balkans, exploring the influence of crusading ideas in the eastern Adriatic, Bosnia and Romania.  He shows that the conquest of "New Rome" (Constantinople) played a role in making the Ottomans reflect on their past and ponder their destiny.  He explores the complexity of interactions between the Christian and Islamic powers which stretched from the central Mediterranean to the Middle East, and the impact that they exerted on Ottoman legitimating processes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Antov analyzes the major patterns of formation of Muslim communities in the Ottoman &amp;#x0D; Balkans from the time of the Ottoman conquest in the second half of the fourteenth to the mid-eighteenth centuries.  He discusses the main factors of the ethno-national and religious transformation such as the influx of Muslim settlers from outside of the Balkans, conversion of indigenous Balkan populations to Islam, and population movements within the Balkans.  By exploring the evolution of historiographical interpretations of these religious and demographic transformations, he also illuminates the political nature of the question of Ottoman legacy in the area.  National historiographies, be it in Bulgaria, Bosnia, Greece, or Albania, often presented divergent interpretations of the Ottoman past, which reflected their current national priorities.  Antov brings all of these interpretations together to highlight the complex historical reality and the tenuous contemporary consensus in matters of demographic diversity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Dr. Yosmaoglu challenges the elite-centered explanation of how the Balkans transitioned from empire to nation-states.  Instead, she shows how local politics informed the larger political struggle for legitimacy in the Ottoman Empire.  Focusing on Ottoman Macedonia, she offers a novel interpretation of national ideology and practice in the Balkans during the last years of Ottoman rule.  She argues that nationalism, a modern political ideology embraced by the Balkan bourgeoisie in its secular form, had to be recast in a new, religious language that was more accessible to the non-national peasants in order to find the mass support it needed to prevail as the principle of political legitimacy.  She also explains how political violence became the ultimate catalyst in this process that welded free-floating allegiances into hard and immutable boundaries.  She introduces a new paradigm of analysis that demonstrates how it was not nationalism that led to conflict in the diversely populated Macedonian lands, but in fact elite-generated violence triggered nationalism as conflict forced people to ambivalently take sides.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection offers writings on the body with a focus on performance, defined as both staged performance and everyday performance. Traditionally, theorizations of the body have either analyzed its impact on its socio-historical environment or treated the body as a self-enclosed semiotic and affective system. This collection makes a conscious effort to merge these two approaches. It is interested in interactions between bodies and other bodies, bodies and environments, and bodies and objects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Beginning in the eleventh century, Muslim Turks gradually established political control over the Byzantine territories in Anatolia and the Balkans, areas typically referred to as the lands of Rum.  A local Muslim scholarly tradition, however, did not immediately emerge in these lands following the establishment of Muslim political control.  Atcil seeks to uncover the origins of a self-perpetuating scholarly system in the lands of Rum during the fifteenth century, examining the conditions, which might have influenced scholars' decision to move around, in the lands of Rum and other Muslim lands during the fifteenth century.  He suggests that the tempo at which scholars moved to the lands of Rum probably remained consistent and perhaps even increased from the fourteenth to the fifteenth century, whereas during the fifteenth century the scholarly scene began to change and move in the direction of being self-sufficient. He points to the region's relative political stability, the concurrent presence of a critical number of high-level scholars, and the establishment of a growing number of well-funded madrasas of royal prestige as factors that made it possible for scholars to receive an advanced education within the lands of Rum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter addresses the phenomenon I am calling "incidental Jewishness" in the content and reception of Nueve Reinas and El aura, the two feature films Fabián Bielinsky made before his death. Bielinsky's work as an assistant director included Cohen vs Rosi, a film with overtly Jewish content; but neither Nueve Reinas nor El aura has been received as a "Jewish film."  After discussing the vexed notion of identity itself (what might we mean when say that a cultural product is "Jewish"?), I discuss how the meanings circulating around the linked signifiers "Jew"/"Jewish"/"Judaism"/"Jewishness" in the context of contemporary Argentina emerge in and from Bielinsky's two feature films.  I pay special attention to what I think of as the Jewish moment in Nueve reinas, in which one of the con men identifies an elderly woman as Jewish and uses that knowledge to win her trust. I argue that this scene is highly suggestive of the ways that Jewishness permeates Argentina on the one hand and remains inassimilable on the other.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mythic structures and other components of mythology and folklore are used in Ninjago and Chima as if they were "myth blocks", pieces available to be snapped into place in various recombinations.  To be sure, this is similar to influential ideas about narrative structure, from Russian folklorist Vladmir Propp's structuralist analysis of Russian folktales, to how the "monomyth" or hero's journey Joseph Campbell used to describe a universal pattern common to every human culture expressed with particular variations has been adopted as a prescriptive formula for contemporary Hollywood screenwriting.  Both realistic and fantastical fictional worlds in a range of media from literature to comic books, movies, and 3-D graphical environments in which people can play games are characterized by infrastructures filled with remixed bits and pieces from various world mythologies.  What's interesting about how LEGO has done this in its original intellectual property imaginary worlds is how mythic structures have become both a part of and a metaphor for the LEGO "System of Play".  LEGO's use of "myth blocks" in constructing its imaginary worlds, and people's participation and extensions within them, are aspects of cultural practices of transmedial experience that exemplify a remix culture.</Abstract>

		<PrimaryURLDescription>LEGO Studies: Examining the Building Blocks of a Transmedial Phenomenon is the first collection to examine LEGO as both a medium into which other franchises can be adapted and a transmedial franchise of its own. Although each essay looks at a particular aspect of the LEGO phenomenon, topics such as adaptation, representation, paratexts, franchises, and interactivity intersect throughout these essays, proposing that the study of LEGO as a medium and a media empire is a rich vein barely touched upon in Media Studies.</PrimaryURLDescription>

		<Abstract>This essay examines the new critical orientation of the charta (manuscript page) and its writing canvas of 31 transcriptional lines employed in both Petrarch's supervised copy of the Rerum vulgarium fragmenta (Vatican Library Latino 3195) and in the rich-text editions of the Petrarchive.org Project. Storey traces Petrarch's strategies in the distribution of text in all five of the work's poetic genres (sonnet, ballata, madrigal, sestina and canzone) in the Rvf. From this material basis, the author demonstrates the utility of studying the work from both the point of view of the manuscript page, the conjunct leaves of the bifolium, and the collective textuality of the gathering (or fascicle).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Among the many handwritten texts inscribed in the first century on the walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum, there sometimes appear also hand-sketched drawings, or figural graffiti. These figural graffiti have involved additional challenges as we create curated, digital editions of ancient graffiti for the Epigraphic Database Roma and as we design a way to search for and retrieve such drawings via the Ancient Graffiti Project search engine. In this article, we discuss the challenges we face and some of the strategies we have developed in response, with a particular focus on the material from Herculaneum.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Digital modeling provides humanists with powerful tools for integrating large amounts of historical information into a unified and coherent display.  This essay is, however, about something else, about what we are doing when we believe we have discovered, from our experience with a digital environment, things about past events that are not documented by traditional sources.  Such an outcome challenges traditional forms of knowledge while enriching our sense of what it is we know about past events and their meaning. The best results come from holding in tension the traditional understandings of the truthfulness of our work and new opportunities for enriching that understanding.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We hope to show that the overall protreptic plan of Aristotle's ethical writings is based on the plan he used in his published work Protrepticus (Exhortation to Philosophy), by highlighting those passages that primarily offer hortatory or protreptic motivation rather than dialectical argumentation and analysis, and by illustrating several ways that Aristotle adapts certain arguments and examples from his Protrepticus. In this essay we confine our attention to the books definitely attributable to the Nicomachean Ethics (thus excluding the common books).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>'Documenting the World' is about the material and social life of photographs and film made in the scientific quest to document the world. Drawing on scholars from the fields of art history, visual anthropology, and science and technology studies, the chapters in this book explore how this documentation—from the initial recording of images, to their acquisition and storage, to their circulation—has altered our lives, our ways of knowing, our social and economic relationships, and even our surroundings. Far beyond mere illustration, photography and film have become an integral, transformative part of the world they seek to show us.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The late artist and critic John Berger once wrote that to see art was to be situated in history and that, conversely, when prevented from seeing what he called "the art of the past," "we are being deprived of the history which belongs to us." By  analyzing both the highbrow (e.g., the Old Masters) and the lowbrow (e.g., advertisements), historians and critics have pioneered new ways of seeing and doing history and opened the world's eyes to the power of visual experience and knowledge as historical topics. This chapter sketches a few of the primary visual tools and methods that have been advanced in visual and social and cultural history research in recent years, in order to encourage more work in this field. After identifying key shifts and recent developments in the theory and methodology of visual and material history in the past several decades, it concludes by suggesting some future developments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>China has an age-old zoomorphic tradition. The First Emperor was famously said to have had the heart of a tiger and a wolf. The names of foreign tribes were traditionally written with characters that included animal radicals. In modern times, the communist government frequently referred to Nationalists as "running dogs," and President Xi Jinping, vowing to quell corruption at all levels, pledged to capture both "the tigers" and "the flies." illustrated with works ranging from Bronze Age vessels to twentieth-century conceptual pieces, this volume is a wide-ranging look at zoomorphic and anthropomorphic imagery in Chinese art. The book's chapter contributors are leading scholars in Chinese art history and related fields.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book chapter is part of a collection of 13 interdisciplinary essays that examine a wide range of topics, including the use and cultural significance of color in the Ancient World during the period 3000 B.C.- 600 A.D. The unifying theme of these essays is the exploration of colors that were preferred in ancient cultures, what social and cultural meanings were attached to them, and how a greater understanding of these cultures can be gained by examining how they used and perceived color. The essays cover the civilizations of Ancient China, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Mesoamerica, and the Islamic world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The northern frontiers of the Ottoman Empire lay across a swathe of lands between Hungary and Iran, arcing through the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, then north of the Black Sea through the steppes of southern Ukraine, and finally proceeding further east along the Caucasus Mountains as far as the Caspian Sea. In a frontier region such as the one on the northern Black Sea, where environment, human geography and historical traditions made the steppe an alien place that did not readily yield to control and assimilation, the fortress was indispensable for maintaining the centre's presence. As imperial presence in such an area was anchored at and emanated from the fortress, the fortress can be seen as a prime target of a strategy aimed at learning about this frontier of the Ottoman world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How can burial furnishings help us to approach the meanings of banqueting imagery in funerary art or understand the place of banqueting in funerary ideologies? Should tombs furnished with klinai or replicas of banquet couches be understood as physical, three-dimensional representations of banqueting, meant to equip the dead for an eternal ‘Totenmahl'? Or do funeral couches mark their occupants as members of the elite class that enjoyed banqueting and/or luxury furniture while alive? These questions are not so easily answered, because klinai in the ancient Greek world were multi-functional furnishings, used for sleeping and resting as well as for dining and revelry, and because burial assemblages are constructed representations, much like tomb paintings or reliefs . This paper will summarize evidence for burial klinai in Greece and Anatolia in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, with particular focus on tombs with additional signifiers of banqueting (tables, drinking vessels, musical instruments, etc.) or with related banqueting imagery (such as the Karaburun tumulus in northern Lycia). Parameters for interpreting funerary klinai as indicators of a ‘Totenmahl' concept will be proposed, and relevant ethnographic evidence will also be considered. It will be argued that, far from providing ‘hard evidence' to guide our interpretations of contemporary funerary images, burial assemblages reflect the same processes of ideological construction that lie behind two-dimensional representations and thus are subject to the same questions of interpretation. Nevertheless, consideration of burial furniture enriches the study of the ‘funerary banquet' and, when seen alongside contemporary images, underlines the importance of this concept—however defined—in certain eras and regions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the early modern era, European imaginaries of the plague associated the disease's geographic origin with areas ruled by the Ottoman Empire. This particular imagined plague-scape was nurtured by a constant supply of plague news that came from eastern Mediterranean port cities and the common tropes of the European travel literature about the indifference of the Muslims inhabiting that land, their fatalism, and their failure to understand contagion. Taken as a whole, the early modern European plague episteme was, to a large extent, shaped by observations of or accounts about the Ottoman experience of plague. Especially after the plague (and historical memories of it) had started to recede from western Europe in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and with the Enlightenment, it was this set of knowledge, beliefs, and ideas that helped to formulate the origins, foci (foyers de peste), historicity, and directionality of the "Oriental plague." &amp;#x0D; This plague paradigm, imbued with unmistakable overtones of epidemiological Orientalism, has had lasting ramifications for the student of the post-Black Death Mediterranean, which is often imagined in epidemiological binaries. In fact, it is fascinating to see how much of that epidemiological imagination has found its way into modern scientific and historical thinking about the plague in time and space. With a conviction that we can no longer afford to keep a Eurocentric vision of this epidemiological past, Varlik revisits some aspects of the epidemiological imaginaries of the Orient. Following the recent work of environmental historians of the Middle East and North Africa, she highlights how the Ottoman plague-scape was described by early modern European travelers and how this knowledge was used for formulating a watershed in the European imagination.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Researchers face a number of obstacles when seeking to understand how the Musim populations of the medieval and early modern period of Ottoman times coped with plagues and other epidemic diseases.  Among these difficulties is the fact that information is often scattered across a wide variety of sources, many of which do not treat the topic directly.  Utilizing these sources, which have not been addressed in the historiography to date, can yield interesting resuts.  My contribution to this volume aims to demonstrate the potential usefulness of specific types of early modern ottoman religious writings, which can illuminate how various segments of the ottoman population viewed plagues, diseases, and possible remedies for them in the pre-modern era.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Jesuit investment in images, whether verbal or visual, virtual or actual, pictorial or poetic, rhetorical or exegetical, was strong and sustained, and may even be identified as one of the order's defining characteristics. Although this interest in images has been richly documented by art historians, theatre historians, and scholars of the emblem, the question of Jesuit image theory has yet to be approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective that examines how the image was defined, conceived, produced, and interpreted within the various fields of learning cultivated by the Society: sacred oratory, pastoral instruction, scriptural exegesis, theology, collegiate pedagogy, poetry and poetics, etc. The papers published in this volume investigate the ways in which Jesuits reflected visually and verbally on the status and functions of the imago, between the foundation of the order in 1540 and its suppression in 1773. Part I examines texts that purport explicitly to theorize about the imago and to analyze its various forms and functions. Part II examines what one might call expressions of embedded image theory, that is, various instances where Jesuit authors and artists use images implicitly to explore the status and functions of such images as indices of image-making.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Contributors include Wietse de Boer, James Clifton, Ralph Dekoninck, Karl Enenkel, Pierre Antoine Fabre, David Graham, Agnès Guiderdoni, Anna Knaap, Walter Melion, Jeffrey Muller, Hilmar Pabel, Aline Smeesters, Andrea Torre, and Steffen Zierholz</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Volume one of The Oxford History of Anglicanism examines a period when the nature of "Anglicanism" was still heavily contested. Rather than merely tracing the emergence of trends that we associate with later Anglicanism, the contributors instead discuss the fluid and contested nature of the Church of England's religious identity in these years, and the different claims to what should count as "Anglican" orthodoxy. After the introduction and narrative chapters explain the historical background, individual chapters then analyze different understandings of the early church and church history; variant readings of the meaning of the royal supremacy, the role of bishops and canon law, and cathedrals; the very diverse experiences of religion in parishes, styles of worship and piety, church decoration, and Bible usage; and the competing claims to "Anglican" orthodoxy of puritanism, "avant-garde conformity" and Laudianism. Also analyzed are arguments over the Church of England's confessional identity and its links with the foreign Reformed Churches, and the alternative models provided by English Protestant activities in Ireland, Scotland and North America. The reforms of the 1640s and 1650s are included in their own right, and the volume concludes that the shape of the Restoration that emerged was far from inevitable, or expressive of a settled "Anglican" identity.</Abstract>

In pursuit of that vision, this work is transhistorical, international, and interdisciplinary. Shakespeare's World, 1500–1660, volume one, includes a comprehensive survey of the world in which Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived, while The World's Shakespeare, 1660–Present, volume two, examines what the world has made of Shakespeare as a cultural icon over the past four centuries. For each of the work's twenty-eight broad subject areas, ranging from translation to popular culture to performing arts, an overview is followed by a series of shorter essays taking up particular aspects of the subject at hand. Richly illustrated with more than three hundred images between the two volumes, this work brings the world, life, and afterlife of Shakespeare to readers, from non-academic Shakespeare fans and students to theater professionals and Shakespeare scholars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The serial sketch form—fragmented, contingent, yet linear—that Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and Wilson J. Wilson honed in the Anglo-African Magazine between 1859 and 1860 was integral to representing the experience of being on the verge, of looking forward not only to the immediacy of the next installment, but also to the "future that is before us."  Harper's "Fancy Sketches" and "Triumph of Freedom—A Dream" register this mix of a deep hemispheric time and entanglement through readings of a seventeenth century Brazilian maroon nation and dream sequences that both review ongoing events like John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry and set these events in the timeless space of myth. Harper and Wilson are also concerned with history as a material processes, which results in narrators whose textual encounters reveal a sense of time as an interlocking of pasts, presents, and futures. Wilson explicitly links temporality to form and genre, representing what John Ernest has usefully framed in terms of "chaotic time and space."  And as the quote in my title suggests, these acts of reading—to read or to have read?—one's destiny suggests that perhaps the answer isn't as important as the awareness the question raises about the intertwining relationship between temporality and form and how pre-Civil War African American literature on the verge represents and makes use of that relationship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Featuring essays from seventeen international scholars, this exciting new collection is the first sustained study of Shakespeare on the university and college stage. Treating the subject both historically and globally, the essays describe theatrical conditions that fit neither the professional nor the amateur models and show how student performances provide valuable vehicles for artistic construction and intellectual analysis. The book redresses the neglect of this distinctive form of Shakespeare performance, opening up new ways of thinking about the nature and value of university production and its ability to draw unique audiences. Looking at productions across the world - from Asia to Europe and North America - it will interest scholars as well as upper-level students in areas such as Shakespeare studies, performance studies and theatre history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Cambridge Guide to the Worlds of Shakespeare aims to replicate the expansive reach of Shakespeare's global reputation. In pursuit of that vision, this work is transhistorical, international, and interdisciplinary. Shakespeare's World, 1500–1660, volume one, includes a comprehensive survey of the world in which Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived, while The World's Shakespeare, 1660–Present, volume two, examines what the world has made of Shakespeare as a cultural icon over the past four centuries. For each of the work's twenty-eight broad subject areas, ranging from translation to popular culture to performing arts, an overview is followed by a series of shorter essays taking up particular aspects of the subject at hand. Richly illustrated with more than three hundred images between the two volumes, this work brings the world, life, and afterlife of Shakespeare to readers, from non-academic Shakespeare fans and students to theater professionals and Shakespeare scholars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collaborative literary history of Europe, the first yet attempted, unfolds through ten sequences of places linked by trade, travel, topography, language, pilgrimage, alliance, disease, and artistic exchange. The period covered, 1348-1418, provides deep context for understanding current developments in Europe, particularly as initiated by the destruction and disasters of World War II. We begin with the greatest of all European catastrophes: the 1348 bubonic plague, which killed one person in three. Literary cultures helped speed recovery from this unprecedented "ground zero" experience, providing solace, distraction, and new ideals to live by. Questions of where Europe begins and ends, then as now, and disputes over whom truly "belongs" on European soil are explored, if not solved, through writing. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; A war that would last for a century convulsed much of western Europe. Divisions between Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christianities endured, and in 1378 the West divided again between popes of Avignon and Rome. Arabic literary cultures linked Fes and Granada to Jerusalem and Damascus; Persian and Turkish writings began to flourish south and west of Constantinople; Jewish intellectuals treasured Arabic texts as well as Hebrew writings; Armenian colophons proved unique. From 1414-18 western nations gathered to heal their papal schism while also exchanging literary, humanist, and musical ideas; visitors from the East hoped for commitment to wider European peace. Freed from nation state historiography, as bequeathed by the nineteenth century, these 82 chapters freshly assess the free movement of European literature in all its variety, local peculiarity, and regenerative power.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ibn Rushd (1126–1198), or Averroes, is widely known as the unrivalled commentator on virtually all works by Aristotle. His commentaries and treatises were used as manuals for understanding Aristotelian philosophy until the Enlightenment. Both Averroes and the movement commonly known as "Latin Averroism" have attracted considerable attention from historians of philosophy and science. Most studies focus on Averroes' psychology, particularly on his doctrine of the "unity of the intellect," Averroes' natural philosophy as a whole and its influence still remain largely unexplored. This volume aims to fill the gap by considering various aspects of Averroes' natural philosophical thought and evaluating its impact on the history of philosophy and science between the late middle ages and the early modern period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Renaissance physicians, influenced by humanism and spurred by their increased knowledge of Hippocratic and Galenic writings, attempted to assimilate these medical works with Aristotelian thought. The similarities between the Aristotelian Problemata and the Hippocratic Airs, Waters, Places allowed Girolamo Cardano and Lodovico Settala, among others, to blur the distinctions between natural philosophical and medical authorities. Philological and historical considerations of these texts as well as judgments about authenticity were colored by the belief that these works were useful for humoral physiology and offered insights into the unity of ancient and modern knowledge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Few families have contributed as much to English history and literature-indeed, to the arts generally-as the Sidney family. This two-volume Ashgate Research Companion assesses the current state of scholarship on family members and their impact, as historical and literary figures, in the period 1500-1700. Volume 1: Lives, begins with an overview of the Sidneys and politics, providing some links to court events, entertainments, literature, and patronage. The volume gives biographies to prominent high-profile Sidney women and men, as well as sections assessing the influence of the family in the areas of the English court, international politics, patronage, religion, public entertainment, the visual arts, and music. The focus of the second volume is the literary contributions of Sir Philip Sidney; Mary Sidney Herbert, Countess of Pembroke; Lady Mary Wroth; Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester; and William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Itinerarium ad Windsor concerns a central question of the Elizabethan era: Why should a woman be allowed to rule with the same powers as a king? The man who poses this controversial question within Itinerarium is none other than Queen Elizabeth's powerful favorite Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. On hand to provide answers are the statesman and poet Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, and William Fleetwood antiquary, Recorder of London, and dutiful chronicler of their 1575 conversation. This critical edition of Itinerarium reproduces Fleetwood's text with annotations and a host of interpretive and contextualizing essays from leading scholars. Taken together, they constitute the definitive introduction to this remarkable discussion of regnant queenship, providing a valuable tool for understanding contemporary notions of and underlying fears concerning the efficacy and desirability of female rule in Elizabethan England.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past three decades scholars have transformed the study of women and gender in early modern Europe. This Ashgate Research Companion presents an authoritative review of the current research on women and gender in early modern Europe from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The authors examine women's lives, ideologies of gender, and the differences between ideology and reality through the recent research across many disciplines, including history, literary studies, art history, musicology, history of science and medicine, and religious studies. The book is intended as a resource for scholars and students of Europe in the early modern period, for those who are just beginning to explore these issues and this time period, as well as for scholars learning about aspects of the field in which they are not yet an expert. The companion offers not only a comprehensive examination of the current research on women in early modern Europe, but will act as a spark for new research in the field.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Drawing on art history, literary studies and social history, the essays in this volume explore a range of intersections between gender and constructions of childhood in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries in Italy, England, France and Spain. The essays are grouped around the themes of celebration and loss, education and social training, growing up and growing old. Contributors grapple with ways in which constructions of childhood were inflected by considerations of gender throughout the early modern world. In so doing, they examine representations of children and childhood in a range of sources from the period, from paintings and poetry to legal records and personal correspondence. The volume sheds light on some of the ways in which, in the relations between Renaissance children and their parents and peers, gender mattered. Gender and Early Modern Constructions of Childhood enriches our understanding of individual children and the nature of familial relations in the early modern period, as well as of the relevance of gender to constructions of self and society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This edited volume brings together a collection of provocative essays examining a number of different facets of Elizabethan foreign affairs, encompassing England and The British Isles, Europe, and the dynamic civilization of Islam. As an entirely domestic queen who never physically left her realm, Elizabeth I cast an inordinately wide shadow in the world around her. The essays is this volume collectively reveal a queen and her kingdom much more connected and integrated into a much wider world than usually discussed in conventional studies of Elizabethan foreign affairs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The four companion volumes of Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions contribute to a contextual evaluation of the mutual influences between scriptural exegesis and hermeneutics on the one hand and practices or techniques of interpretation in natural philosophy and the natural sciences on the other. We seek to raise the low profile this theme has had both in the history of science and in the history of biblical interpretation. Furthermore, questions about the interpretation of scripture continue to be provoked by current theological reflection on scientific theories. We also seek to provide a historical context for renewed reflection on the role of the hermeneutics of scripture in the development of theological doctrines that interact with the natural sciences.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Contributors are Peter Barker, Paul M.

		<Abstract>This Companion provides a full introduction to the poetry of William Shakespeare through discussion of his freestanding narrative poems, the Sonnets, and his plays. Fourteen leading international scholars provide accessible and authoritative chapters on all relevant topics: from Shakespeare's seminal role in the development of English poetry, the wide-ranging practice of his poetic form, and his enigmatic place in print and manuscript culture, to his immersion in English Renaissance politics, religion, classicism, and gender dynamics. With individual chapters on Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece, The Passionate Pilgrim, 'The Phoenix and the Turtle', the Sonnets, and A Lover's Complaint, the Companion also includes chapters on the presence of poetry in the dramatic works, on the relation between poetry and performance, and on the reception and influence of the poems. The volume includes a chronology of Shakespeare's life, a note on reference works, and a reading list for each chapter.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Thomas Middleton (1580-1627) - 'our other Shakespeare' - is the only other Renaissance playwright who created lasting masterpieces of both comedy and tragedy; he also wrote the greatest box-office hit of early modern London (the unique history play A Game at Chess ). His range extends beyond these traditional genres to tragicomedies, masques, pageants, pamphlets, epigrams, and Biblical and political commentaries, written alone or in collaboration with Shakespeare, Webster, Dekker, Ford, Heywood, Rowley, and others. Compared by critics to Aristophanes and Ibsen, Racine and Joe Orton, he has influenced writers as diverse as Aphra Behn and T. S. Eliot. Though repeatedly censored in his own time, he has since come to be particularly admired for his representations of the intertwined pursuits of sex, money, power, and God.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The Collected Works brings together for the first time in a single volume all the works currently attributed to Middleton. It is the first edition of Middleton's works since 1886. The texts are printed in modern spelling and punctuation, with critical introductions and foot-of-the-page commentaries; they are arranged in chronological order, with a special section of Juvenilia. The volume is introduced by essays on Middleton's life and reputation, on early modern London, and on the varied theatres of the English Renaissance. Extensively illustrated, it incorporates much new information on Middleton's life, canon, texts, and contexts. A self-consciously 'federal edition', The Collected Works applies contemporary theories about the nature of literature and the history of the book to editorial practice.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Compiled by art historians, literary scholars, musicologists, and historians, this essay collection is an innovative and interdisciplinary study of Queen Henrietta Maria and her multi-faceted roles and responsibilities. Elements of the queen's popular biography - her European identity and devout Catholic faith - are only a part of the backdrop against which Henrietta Maria is re-considered. Drawing on the expertise of an international group of scholars from different disciplines, these essays explore and shed new light on the Queen's various roles: a patron of performing and visual arts with taste and influence comparable to her husband's, her salient political position between the French and English courts, and her political sentiments at the outbreak of the English Civil War. Through cutting-edge archival research that includes investigations into household accounts and personal correspondence, this collection ultimately presents a new assessment of female power and influence at the early modern court. What becomes strikingly evident is that Henrietta Maria had a distinct and profound influence on material and political culture that deserves the attention of art history, literature, theatre, and musicology scholars.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection of various approaches to early modern England offers readers such pleasures as the most complete bibliography to date of King James's poetry, a unique edition of a memoir by the son of Sir Martin Barnham, as well as new arguments about Skelton, More, Elyot, Marguerite de Navarre, Sidney, Spenser, Daniel, Shakespeare (The Comedy of Errors), the Henriad, Macbeth, The Winter's Tale, Mary Wroth, Isabella Whitney, and Marvell. Here too are new approaches to such topics as the royal succession, Shakespeare's "bad" quartos, romance, witches, politics, humanism, English and Irish identity, and "conversations about women," finishing with an essay about. . ."nothing." As Arthur Kinney has wryly noted, "no text is innocent," and in this volume many texts are made to confess who and what they are.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Much ink has been spent on accounts of the English Civil Wars of the mid-seventeenth century, yet royalism has been largely neglected. This volume of essays by leading scholars in the field seeks to fill that significant gap in our understanding by focusing on those who took up arms for the king. The royalists described were not reactionary, absolutist extremists but pragmatic, moderate men who were not so different in temperament or background from the vast majority of those who decided to side with, or were forced by circumstances to side with, Parliament and its army. The essays force us to think beyond the simplistic dichotomy between royalist 'absolutists' and 'constitutionalists' and suggest instead that allegiances were much more fluid and contingent than has hitherto been recognized. This is a major contribution to the political and intellectual history of the Civil Wars and of early modern England more generally.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How do the formal properties of early modern texts, together with the materials that envelop and shape them, relate to the cultural, political, and social world of their production? Formal matters: Reading the materials of English Renaissance literature answers this question by linking formalist analysis with the insights of book history. It thus represents the new English Renaissance literary historiography tying literary composition to the materials and material practices of writing. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The book combines studies of familiar and lesser known texts, from the poems and plays of Shakespeare to jests and printed commonplace books. Its ten studies make important, original contributions to research on the genres of early modern literature, focusing on the involvement of literary forms in the scribal and print cultures of compilation, continuation, translation, and correspondence, as well as in matters of political republicanism and popular piety, among others. Taken together, the collection's essays by Heather James, Matthew Zarnowiecki, Adam Smyth, Jeffrey Todd Knight, Tanya Pollard, Henry S. Turner, Alan Stewart, Amanda Bailey, Peter Lake, Shankar Raman, and an afterword by David Scott Kastan, exemplify how an attention to form and matter can historicise writing without abandoning a literary focus.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Coming of age has been one of the great themes of literature for over two thousand years. From the maturation of Telemachus in The Odyssey to the stunted adolescence of Holden Caufield in The Catcher in the Rye, it has spanned eras, countries, and cultures. It is the theme of every young person's life, and adolescence a time many adults look back on as one of the most formative periods of their lives.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Edited by Kent Baxter, Associate Professor of English at California State University, Northridge, this volume in the Critical Insights series presents a variety of new essays on the perennial theme. For readers who are studying it for the first time, a four essays survey the critical conversation regarding the theme, explore its cultural and historical contexts, and offer close and comparative readings of key texts in the genre. Readers seeking a deeper understanding of the theme can then move on to other essays that explore it in depth through a variety of critical approaches. Works discussed include Romeo and Juliet; Little Women; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; …and the earth did not devour him; Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian; Jane Eyre; The Catcher in the Rye; and The Odyssesy. Among the contributors are Vincent Cheng, Gregory Eiselein, Jane Hedley, Heather James, and Steven Mintz.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My essay takes the form of a general meditation on what is at stake in the work in and on "the archives" that has reshaped and revitalized the interdisciplinary study of texts and cultures over the last few decades. This is neither the time nor the place to attempt an overview of, or even an introduction to, the Renaissance period's own archives: much more work — by a team of scholars — would be needed to survey the political, architectural, and intellectual developments that led to the creation of new documentary collections in Renaissance homes, cities, and states, along with an increasingly sophisticated sense of the disciplines that we now call library science and information management (and I would put this high on my list of the great collaborative projects that remain to be done for the Renaissance period). Rather, I will look at some of the materials and metaphors that frame our work in archives and, in particular, urge us to think more deeply about the peculiar place of dust. As we shall see, this small but significant substance brings into focus a number of questions about our relationship to the past — questions that have become more pressing and more interesting with the advent of digital technology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Renaissance Transformations: The Making of English Writing 1500-1650 asserts the centrality of historical understanding in shaping critical vision. This collection of distinctive new essays explores the dynamic cultural, intellectual and social processes that moulded literary writing in the Renaissance. Acutely attentive to the complexities that we confront in our attempts to understand the past, this book explores important relations among literary form, material and imaginative culture which compel our attention in the twenty-first century. Addressing three crucial areas at the forefront of current academic inquiry - 'Making Writing: Form, Rhetoric and Print Culture', 'Shaping Communities: Textual Spaces, Mapping History' and 'Embodying Change: Psychic and Somatic Performances' - this innovative, timely volume is of fundamental importance to all those who study and teach Renaissance literature, history and culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In his 1987 work Paratexts, the theorist Gérard Genette established physical form as crucial to the production of meaning. Here, experts in early modern book history, materiality and rhetorical culture present a series of compelling explorations of the architecture of early modern books. The essays challenge and extend Genette's taxonomy, exploring the paratext as both a material and a conceptual category. Renaissance Paratexts takes a fresh look at neglected sites, from imprints to endings, and from running titles to printers' flowers. Contributors' accounts of the making and circulation of books open up questions of the marking of gender, the politics of translation, geographies of the text and the interplay between reading and seeing. As much a history of misreading as of interpretation, the collection provides novel perspectives on the technologies of reading and exposes the complexity of the playful, proliferating and self-aware paratexts of English Renaissance books.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On Valentine's Day 1481 it rained blood in Dijon, capital of the duchy of Burgundy. Especially soaked were the castle, which King Louis XI of France had recently begun, and the Franciscan convent where the town council met. Five weeks later Dijon experienced another bloody rainfall, shocking the residents and defying Louis XI, who scoffed at reports he had received about the first one and prohibited any interpretations of such a portentous event. Ignoring Louis's ban, the heavens continued to pour gore on Dijon. Dijon's gory showers have direct political implications that explain their appeal to Bisontin oligarchs like Ludin and reflect their conception of true Burgundianness. Dijon is immediately identified in Ludin's memoir as the residence of the Burgundian dukes, Mary of Burgundy is its "obvious" ruler, and Dijon is the duchy's "principal city".</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For many, Shakespeare represents the advent of modernity. It is easy to forget that he was in fact a writer deeply embedded in the Middle Ages, who inherited many of his shaping ideas and assumptions from the medieval past. This collection brings together essays by internationally renowned scholars of medieval and early modern literature, the history of the book and theatre history to present new perspectives on Shakespeare and his medieval heritage. Separated into four parts, the collection explores Shakespeare and his work in the context of the Middle Ages, medieval books and language, the British past, and medieval conceptions of drama and theatricality, together showing Shakespeare's work as rooted in late medieval history and culture. Insisting upon Shakespeare's complexity and medieval multiplicity, Medieval Shakespeare gives readers the opportunity to appreciate both Shakespeare and his period within the traditions that fostered and surrounded him.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This revised and enlarged Fourth Edition expands and improves on the strengths of the previous three editions. All selections are based on early and established texts, fully glossed, and carefully annotated. An Editor's Note follows each section.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This new edition addresses the shifts in scholarly and critical interests in Spenser studies since 1993 as well as access provided by new technology. Notes reflect the information that Spenser's best readers would have at their fingertips without spoiling the pleasure of reading Spenser for the first time. Mother Hubberds Tale from the 1591 Complaints is newly included. The Ruines of Rome, Spenser's translation of Joachim Du Bellay's Antiquitez, is also added to give readers the chance to see Spenser at work as a translator and to give the English perspective on Rome. Sixteen critical essays have been added to supplement fourteen earlier commentaries. Among the perspectives new to the Fourth Edition are those of C. S Lewis, Martha Craig, Gordon Teskey, Jeff Dolven, David Wilson-Okamura, and Jennifer Summit.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In keeping with the last edition, critical pieces on the House of Busyrane, Spenser's pastoral, Muiopotmos, and Amoretti are grouped together to facilitate classroom discussion. New selections from Jane Grogan, Andrew D. Hadfield, Colin Burrow, Lynn Staley, Lauren Silberman, and A. E. B. Coldiron join the readings on House of Busyrane, and "Amoretti" grows with selections by A. Leigh DeNeef and Helena Mennie Shire.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; A Chronology of Spenser's life and an extensive Bibliography are also included.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Would there have been a Renaissance without translation?" Karen Newman and Jane Tylus ask in their Introduction to this wide-ranging group of essays on the uses of translation in an era formative for the modern age. The early modern period saw cross-cultural translation on a massive scale. Humanists negotiated status by means of their literary skills as translators of culturally prestigious Greek and Latin texts, as teachers of those same languages, and as purveyors of the new technologies for the dissemination of writing. Indeed, with the emergence of new vernaculars and new literatures came a sense of the necessary interactions of languages in a moment that can truly be defined as "after Babel."&amp;#x0D; As they take their starting point from a wide range of primary sources—the poems of Louise Labé, the first Catalan dictionary, early printed versions of the Ptolemy world map, the King James Bible, and Roger Williams's Key to the Language of America—the contributors to this volume provide a sense of the political, religious, and cultural stakes for translators, their patrons, and their readers. They also vividly show how the very instabilities engendered by unprecedented linguistic and technological change resulted in a far more capacious understanding of translation than what we have today.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; A genuinely interdisciplinary volume, Early Modern Cultures of Translation looks both east and west while at the same time telling a story that continues to the present about the slow, uncertain rise of English as a major European and, eventually, world language.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Reformation of the sixteenth century shattered the unity of medieval Christendom, and the resulting fissures spread to the corners of the earth. No scholar of the period has done more than Carlos M.N. Eire, however, to document how much these ruptures implicated otherworldly spheres as well. His deeply innovative publications helped shape new fields of study, intertwining social, intellectual, cultural, and religious history to reveal how, lived beliefs had real and profound implications for social and political life in early modern Europe. Reflecting these themes, the volume celebrates the intellectual legacy of Carlos Eire's scholarship, applying his distinctive combination of cultural and religious history to new areas and topics. In so doing it underlines the extent to which the relationship between the natural and the supernatural in the early modern world was dynamic, contentious, and always urgent. Organized around three sections - 'Connecting the Natural and the Supernatural', 'Bodies in Motion: Mind, Soul, and Death' and 'Living One's Faith' - the essays are bound together by the example of Eire's scholarship, ensuring a coherence of approach that makes the book crucial reading for scholars of the Reformation, Christianity and early modern cultural history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We have long been taught that the Enlightenment was an attempt to free the world from the clutches of Christian civilization and make it safe for philosophy. The lesson has been well learned. In today's culture wars, both liberals and their conservative enemies, inside and outside the academy, rest their claims about the present on the notion that the Enlightenment was a secularist movement of philosophically driven emancipation. Historians have had doubts about the accuracy of this portrait for some time, but they have never managed to furnish a viable alternative to it-for themselves, for scholars interested in matters of church and state, or for the public at large.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In this book, William J. Bulman and Robert G. Ingram bring together recent scholarship from distinguished experts in history, theology, and literature to make clear that God not only survived the Enlightenment but thrived within it as well. The Enlightenment was not a radical break from the past in which Europeans jettisoned their intellectual and institutional inheritance. It was, to be sure, a moment of great change, but one in which the characteristic convictions and traditions of the Renaissance and Reformation were perpetuated to the point of transformation, in the wake of the Wars of Religion and during the early phases of globalization. The Enlightenment's primary imperatives were not freedom and irreligion but peace and prosperity. As a result, Enlightenment could be Christian, communitarian, or authoritarian as easily as it could be atheistic, individualistic, or libertarian.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Honing in on the intellectual crisis of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries while moving from Spinoza to Kant and from India to Peru, God in the Enlightenment takes a prism to the age of lights.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The original essays in Oxford Twenty-First Century Approaches to Literature mean to provoke rather than reassure, to challenge rather than codify. Instead of summarizing existing knowledge scholars working in the field aim at opening fresh discussion; instead of emphasizing settled consensus they direct their readers to areas of enlivened and unresolved debate.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Following the models established by previous volumes in the series, Early Modern Theatricality launches a new generation of scholarship on early modern drama by focusing on the rich formal capacities of theatrical performance. The collection gathers some of the most innovative critics in the field to examine the techniques, objects, bodies, and conventions that characterized early modern theatricality, from the Tudor period to the Restoration. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Taking their cues from a series of guiding keywords, the contributors identify the fundamental features of theatricality in the period, using them to launch conceptually adventurous arguments that provoke our rediscovery of early modern drama in all its complexity and inventiveness.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Is it possible to hear blank pentameter verse during a theatrical performance? Can an audience perceive the difference between verse and prose, or hear when the playwright alters the iambic rhythm? Is blank verse a constitutive element of the performance event, something whose handling by the actors should be used to measure a production's success? Is the poetry the actors speak more important than the visual and narrative experience they work to create? This chapter examines some answers that have been provided to these questions by modern criticism and performance. Part 19.1 discusses scholarly conceptions of blank verse as an historical phenomenon. Part 19.2 discusses the place Shakespeare's poetry has held in post-Renaissance engagements with Shakespeare's plays in performance. Part 19.3 focuses onOthelloin order to draw some conclusions about the historical and ideological stakes of speaking, experiencing, and criticizing dramatic poetry in live performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While much attention has been devoted to performances of Shakespeare's plays today, little has been focused on modern productions of the plays of his contemporaries, such as Marlowe, Webster and Jonson. Performing Early Modern Drama Today offers an overview of early modern performance, featuring chapters by academics, teachers and practitioners, incorporating a variety of approaches. The book examines modern performances in both Britain and America and includes interviews with influential directors, close analysis of particular stage and screen adaptations and detailed appendices of professional and amateur productions. Chapters examine intellectual and practical opportunities to analyse what is at stake when the plays of Shakespeare's contemporaries are performed by ours. Whether experimenting with original performance practices or contemporary theatrical and cinematic ones, productions of early modern drama offer an inspiring, sometimes unusual, always interesting perspective on the plays they interpret for modern audiences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter reports on the investigation and interpretation of wall paintings recovered from the Late Preclassic period (300 B.C.E – 300 C.E.) Maya site of San Bartolo in Guatemala, as well as provides insights into artistic attribution and understanding of workshop practices in the archaeological past. Through both stylistic and compositional analysis of the murals, multiple artistic hands are identified and confirmed. This integrated analysis characterizes the painting technique and the development of figural features; examines wall preparation through the application and finishing of plaster; and studies the spatial distribution of specific colorant hue compositional groups. Reliance on multiple lines of evidence enables a comprehensive reconstruction of collaborative workshop practice and understanding of artistic identity, while at the same time informs future conservation of the in situ murals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter undertakes a defamiliarizing reading of the dominant Archaic genre, the Homeric epic. Taking his cue from Bakhtin's theorization of the novel as a hybrid genre, Faraone points out that the Homeric poems analogously draw on and incorporate preexistent genres. In the case of the Iliad, a text that is to a great extent constituted within an oral tradition, the recognition of its multi-genred nature reveals divergent intents that a holistic reading (in the Neo-Unitarian paradigm of Homeric criticism) would seek to downplay or explain away. Faraone applies this approach to what is one of the best-known texts in European literature, the first book of the Iliad. Pointing to inconsistencies in characterization of Achilles and Agamemnon, as well as to a number of other textual clues, he proposes to regard a substantial segment of the book—the Chryses episode—as a cult hymn originally performed in a ritual context and then incorporated into the Panhellenic text of Homer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1840-1870, François Delsarte's course in applied aesthetics trained opera singers and orators in his system of gestural and vocal signs ("semeiotique"). Delsarte provided performers with mental, physical, and spiritual tools to inquire into human nature. Delsarte's aesthetic form of inquiry is paradoxical: he draws on contemporaneous scientific methods while his intellectual framework cites pre-modern sources, chiefly Augustine and Aquinas.  Delsarte's performer utilizes semiotic methods, based on these earlier sources' understanding of sign, to represent the dramatic character's mind, life, and soul. Representing triadic human nature thus draws the performer closer to the triune nature of God. This paper argues that Delsarte's ostensibly scientific semeiotique rests on concepts of reason and inquiry that derive from his mid-19th-century turn to neglected sources in philosophy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article examines the theory of the will by the thirteenth century Parisian master, James of Viterbo.  Of primary concern in the study is the adoption by James of Anselm's doctrine of the two affections of the will, which is the most ambitious prior to Duns Scotus.  Comparison of James's theory of the will and the extent of his voluntarisim is made to Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, and Godfrey of Fontaines. 26,000 words.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the most active areas of recent research into Duns Scotus has been on his theory of free will. Of particular interest has been his appropriation of Anselm of Canterbury's innovation that the will has a twofold affection or inclination, one for justice (affectio iustitiae) and the other for happiness (affectio commodi). In adopting Anselm's theory, Scotus's made the affection for justice the primary source of freedom in the will by construing it as a restraint on the natural drive for happiness.  This development in Scotus has been seen as important as a proto-Kantian rejection of eudaimonism by making justice rather than happiness the center of morality. The aim of this study is to reconstruct the largely ignored historical and theoretical development of Anselm's doctrine that was the immediate source of Scotus's own version of the theory.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper (forthcoming in an Aberdeen University Press volume to be edited by Syrithe Pugh) offers access to the kinds of conversation with antiquity made possible by instances of parallel Latin and vernacular composition in certain early modern poets.  Less obviously, I extend this approach through parallelism to embrace Latin translations by others of vernacular texts (with Paradise Lost as a key case), arguing that such Latin paratexts acquire their own complementary intertextual energy, which can extend and complicate the conversations of their ‘originals' with the classical tradition.  My discussion is driven by Marvell and Milton in the English tradition, and in the final pages glances briefly at Ronsard and Du Bellay in the French.&amp;#x0D; In the longer term, this paper feeds into my book project, working title *Poetry across languages: literature, literalism and the Latin tradition*.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper offers cross-linguistic readings of ancient Greek and Latin epic proems or prologues, at a point of heuristic intersection between the study of translation (or quasi-translation) and of digital text-matching:  a set of snapshots of what I term poetic transliteralism.  It begins with Livius Andronicus and ends with a look at the so-called Ilias Latina ('Latin Iliad').  &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; In the short term, the paper will appear in a forthcoming volume of the Geneva 2015 conference 'Intertextuality in Flavian epic poetry', within a group of papers on 'theory, practice and the digital humanities'.  In the context of that volume it mediates between sets of contributions offering philological and electronic approaches to poetic memory and literary system.  In the longer term, the paper feeds into my book project, working title *Poetry across languages: literature, literalism and the Latin tradition*.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Singing together is a tried and true method of establishing and maintaining a group's identity. Identity, Intertextuality, and Performance in Early Modern Song Culture for the first time explores comparatively the dynamic process of group formation through the production and appropriation of songs in various European countries and regions. Drawing on oral, handwritten and printed sources, with examples ranging from 1450 to 1850, the authors investigate intertextual patterns, borrowing of melodies, and performance practices as these manifested themselves in a broad spectrum of genres including ballads, popular songs, hymns and political songs. The volume intends to be a point of departure for further comparative studies in European song culture.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Contributors are: Ingrid Åkesson, Mary-Ann Constantine, Patricia Fumerton, Louis Peter Grijp, Éva Guillorel, Franz-Josef Holznagel, Tine de Koninck, Christopher Marsh, Hubert Meeus, Nelleke Moser, Dieuwke van der Poel, Sophie Reinders, David Robb, Clara Strijbosch, and Anne Marieke van der Wal.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>There are 27 chapters by leading experts as well as 13 feature object studies to highlight specific items that have survived from this period (defined broadly as c.1500–c.1800). These contributions explore the things people acquired, owned, treasured, displayed and discarded, the spaces in which people used and thought about things, the social relationships which cluster around goods – between producers, vendors and consumers of various kinds – and the way knowledge travels around those circuits of connection. The content also engages with wider issues such as the relationship between public and private life, the changing connections between the sacred and the profane, or the effects of gender and social status upon lived experience.  Constructed as an accessible, wide-ranging guide to research practice, the book describes and represents the methods which have been developed within various disciplines for analysing pre-modern material culture. It comprises four sections which open up the approaches of various disciplines to non-specialists: ‘Definitions, disciplines, new directions', ‘Contexts and categories', ‘Object studies' and ‘Material culture in action'.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, we describe Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS), a new set of tools for prosopography - the identification of individuals and study of their interactions - in support of humanities research. Prosopography is an example of "big data" in the humanities, characterized not by the size of the datasets, but by the way that computational and data-driven methods can transform scholarly workflows. BPS is based upon re-usable infrastructure, supporting generalized web services for corpus management, social network analysis, and visualization. The BPS disambiguation model is a formal implementation of the traditional heuristics used by humanists, and supports plug-in rules for adaptation to a wide range of domain corpora. A workspace model supports exploratory research and collaboration. We contrast the BPS model of configurable heuristic rules to other approaches for automated text analysis, and explain how our model facilitates interpretation by humanist researchers. We describe the significance of the BPS assertion model in which researchers assert conclusions or possibilities, allowing them to override automated inference, to explore ideas in what-if scenarios, and to formally publish and subscribe-to asserted annotations among colleagues, and/or with students. We present an initial evaluation of researchers' experience using the tools to study corpora of cuneiform tablets, and describe plans to expand the application of the tools to a broader range of corpora.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, we describe Berkeley Prosopography Services(BPS), a new set of tools for prosopography - the identification of individuals and study of their interactions - in support of humanities research. The BPS tools include 1) functionality to import TEI documents and convert to our data model, 2) a disambiguation engine to associate names to persons based upon configurable heuristic rules, 3) an assertion model that supports flexible researcher curation and tracks provenance, 4) social network analysis and 5) graph visualization tools to analyze and understand social relations, and 6) a workspace model supporting exploratory research and collaboration. We contrast the BPS model that uses configurable heuristic rules to other approaches for automated text analysis, and explain how our model facilitates interpretation by humanist researchers. We describe the significance of our curation model that improves upon traditional curation and annotation as a fact-based model by adding a more flexible model in which researchers assert conclusions or  possibilities, allowing them to override automated inference, to explore ideas in what-if scenarios, and to formally publish and subscribe-to asserted annotations among colleagues, and/or with students. We detail the architecture and our implementation of the tools as a set of reusable web services and web application UI. We present an initial evaluation of researchers' experience using the tools to study corpora of cuneiform tablets, and describe plans to expand the application of the tools to a broader range of corpora.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay examines Xiaolu Guo as a paradigmatic writer of geopolitics, biopolitics, and capitalism in contemporary Chinese Anglophone fiction.  The essay first focuses on A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers to rethink models of the Anglophone.  Against utopian conceptions of English as a privileged language of heterogeneity or hybridity, Dictionary is analyzed in terms of biocapital and geopolitics, as a narrative of the Chinese migrant's absorption into the Anglophone publishing industry and the Anglophone empire.  The essay then analyzes UFO in Her Eyes as representative of a recent turn in Chinese fiction toward issues of biocapital, the increasing entanglement of the communist state's regulation of bodies with its capitalist goals.  Unique among biocapitalist fiction, however, UFO further situates contemporary China in a global post-9/11 context of state surveillance and defense security.  Guo's novels, then, offer a distinctly instructive framework for comparative biopolitics, biocapital, and the global security state.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the late sixth century, John of Ephesus's Church History and Lives of the Eastern Saints drew on familiar narratives of early Christian martyrdom to encourage Christians who rejected the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE) to endure earthly sufferings that he claimed were caused by imperially sanctioned persecution [rdifuta] against God's true saints.   From a historical perspective, however, Daniel Washburn has noted several differences between these centuries, such as Constantine's use of the familiar Roman punishment of banishment with increasing frequency for religious minorities and with a new rhetorical goal of reform through conversion to imperial orthodoxy, leading Éric Fournier to question whether the use of the term "persecution" for Christian rulers' treatment of dissident Christians might be misleading.   After all, unlike their earlier counterparts, most of the heroes in John's sixth-century stories seem to have been more in danger of hypothermia from the winter cold in exile or prison than of being torn limb from limb by wild beasts in a Roman arena.  Despite these differences, however, later Christians who were at odds with imperial orthodoxy produced narratives that instead stressed their parallels with earlier Christians, claiming that the concern for eternal salvation that motivated their defiance was the same; their suffering, equivalent; and their steadfast saints equally martyrs.  This paper will argue that although the empire's treatment of Christians who refused to participate in key ritual offerings shifted from the second to the sixth century, John of Ephesus interpreted the ostensibly kinder and gentler reform-minded later imperial pressure as equally threatening to Christians' eternal salvation as earlier pressures had been, which for him justified narrating the stories of his exiled saints through the familiar rhetoric of martyrdom and persecution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Narratives of violence pervade the fifth- and sixth-century anti-Chalcedonian writings of John Rufus, Zachariah Rhetor, Philoxenos of Mabbug, Severus of Antioch, and John of Ephesus, who depict their heroes as the most recent martyrs in a long line of suffering saints who persevered in Christian truth in the face of unjust imperial persecution.  These stories, however, were carefully crafted for rhetorical effect.  Faced with various threats to their followers' allegiance, these leaders represented anti-Chalcedonian Christians in the lineage of the early martyrs in the hope of defending their doctrinal legitimacy and thus reducing the rate of apostasy from their churches.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Taking my cue from Johann Zoffany's "The Auriol and Dashwood Families" (1783-87) painted in Calcutta, I will look at the intersections between material culture, botanizing, and cultivating tea in late eighteenth-century Bengal. Zoffany's group portrait of a tea party in a Calcutta garden was completed just around the time British naturalists and East India Company officials were discussing the commercial potential of the tea plant. As letters and specimens circulated between Calcutta, London, and Canton, a Chinese exotic was about to be transformed into a British colonial commodity despite anxieties about its medical effects and cultural impact. My essay focuses on the diverse but related visual realms that played key roles in reinventing Chinese tea as a commercial product and a fashionable drink. As importantly, they were mediated through different registers of taste deeply embedded in readings of British character and sensibility. Such readings in turn, would have a profound impact on transplanting Chinese tea in India. In 1786, Colonel Robert Kyd created a botanical garden in Calcutta with the strategic goal to experiment with growing Chinese tea, among other lucrative plants. If successful, the plan would relieve the East India Company of their dependence on the China Trade. It would also usher in a distinctly "British" visual culture of tea drinking in a colonial landscape. Thus, I look at how the aesthetics of tea consumption, inspired by a Chinese import, were transplanted in Britain's emergent tea-growing enclave--India.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article examines illustrations of Huguenot violence in the book that is arguably the most important sixteenth-century geographical text on France, François de Belleforest's Cosmographie Universelle (1575). Working with printers Nicolas Chesneau and Michel Sonnius, Belleforest adapted and expanded Sebastian Münster's geography (Cosmographia, first published in German in 1544) for a French audience. Drawing on information collected from sources all over the country, Belleforest composed an entirely new section on France. Here geography and history interact. In this long and detailed text, the Catholic author engages with contemporary events – the ongoing civil wars – in images that mark the spread of heresy through France. These include images of the Huguenots themselves – those Belleforest designates as heretics – and, especially, images of places attacked and ruined: the text accumulates examples of destroyed churches, monasteries, convents, and towns. The resulting description presents a country ravaged by those the author names "heretical Huguenots." My analysis situates these examples of physical devastation within Belleforest's larger geographical project. He uses these examples in two notable ways: as a mapping strategy, to identify the many locations of destruction; and as a polemical gesture, to highlight the firm Catholic convictions of the inhabitants of many towns throughout France and, ultimately, of the author himself. Strikingly, most of the woodcut engravings of cities and towns that accompany the written description of France do not show any evidence of the physical devastation. This examination concludes with a consideration of one fascinating exception: a city view that displays destroyed sites in an otherwise empty landscape, a striking visual rendering of the absence caused by Huguenot and Catholic violence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Because an increasing number of patients have medical conditions that render them incompetent at making their own medical choices, more and more medical choices are now made by surrogates, often patient family members. However, many studies indicate that surrogates often do not discharge their responsibilities adequately, and in particular, do not choose in accordance with what those patients would have chosen for themselves, especially when it comes to end-of-life medical choices. This chapter argues that a significant part of the explanation of such surrogate failure is that family surrogates are likely to undergo anticipatory grief when making end-of-life decisions. After clarifying both the emotional structure and object of grief, I propose that the pending death of a loved one induces an emotional conflict in surrogates between the care demanded by their responsibility as surrogates and the attachment surrogates feel toward their dying loved one, an attachment surrogates "resolve" in the direction of attachment rather than care. This hypothesis helps to explain both surrogates' general inability to exercise "substituted judgment" on behalf of their loved ones and a wide swath of the particular data regarding this inability (e.g., that surrogates more often err by choosing overtreatment). I conclude by considering possible clinical and philosophical responses to this hypothesis.</Abstract>

Este variopinto grupo de misioneros estableció un dialogo particularmente fructífero con las naciones nativas americanas debido a su política de adaptación a las tradiciones culturales indígenas.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Timbre exists at the confluence of the physical and the perceptual, and due to inconsistencies between these frames, it is notoriously hard to describe. This chapter examines the relationship between timbre and language, offering a critical review of theoretical and empirical thought on timbre semantics and providing a preliminary cognitive linguistic account of timbre description. It first traces the major conceptual and methodological advances in psychological timbre research since the 1970s with a focus on the mediating role of verbalization in previous paradigms. It then discusses the cognitive mechanisms underlying how listeners map timbral qualities onto verbal attributes. Applying a cognitive linguistic approach, the chapter concludes that timbre description may reflect certain fundamental aspects of human embodiment, which may help account for certain trans-historical and cross-cultural consistencies in descriptive practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The introduction discusses the conceptual underpinnings of the book, focusing on the ideological values ascribed to tone in popular music. It begins with a discussion of electric guitar tone and the amateur and professional musicians who experiment with it through various means of production and amplification. This transitions into a discussion of the definitions of "tone" as opposed to "timbre" and the relationship between the two concepts that will be discussed in the ensuing chapters. It concludes with a discussion of the organization of the book and a summary of chapters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter investigates the "brutal" timbral soundscape of death metal music. Through a discussion of electric guitar tone and vocal techniques, Wallmark contends that metal musicians knowingly manipulate biological responses within a symbolically mediated context, pitting "noise" against "music" in a ritualized dialectic. Theorizing the role of distortion in the affective vocabulary of the style, particularly its simulation of bodily pain, the chapter invokes Rene Girard's theory of sacrificial violence to conclude that timbre performs potent cultural work in the ritual space of the death metal concert. Sociological and psychological aspects of "extreme" timbres are discussed in conclusion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A Peace Pedagogy from the Borderlines   What is peace? It may seem that the answer is self-evident, only its path to realization tangled, obscure, and impossible to sustain. That is certainly the assumption of our students. Yet, the question of "what is peace" is an enduring one, without a single answer. Therefore, the underlying assumption of the course we have developed is that concepts of peace are mutable: changing with time, as well as with cultural, religious, and geopolitical perspectives. Our challenge is to resist the urge to arrive at a final definition, or even to develop a map for constructing peace in a modern conflict. Rather, we and our students repeatedly ask ourselves what is peace as we try to unpack its variegated meanings. Our task together is critical, made acute because this will be the only course about peace our students will ever encounter during their tenure at our university. Our goal, at once modest and ambitious, is to instigate thought about peace; to provoke discussion, and exploration; to render peace worthy of seriousness, challenging the old-fashioned stereotypes many of our students may share that peace is a mere relic of a bygone Vietnam "hippie" era or an unobtainable fantasy.  Instead, and together with them, we scrutinize many of the linguistic and historical conditions of peace amid the lacunae of the broader strokes rendered by wars that comprise so much of recorded history (Boulding 2000: 16). Like war, peace happened, too. This startles many students. Often history or political science courses ignore, or fail to make explicit, the reality that many accomplishments in history require freedom from direct violence. Because peace, unlike war, lacks a narrative arc, it often seems more difficult to grasp. Peace can seem ambiguous or even irrelevant, for example, often muted in survey history courses.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ancient Greek temples and treasuries articulated order at a monumental scale. The same may be said for Greek civic buildings for commerce, governance, and spectacle. The architectural language of order in these public and religious buildings consisted of the Doric and Ionic "orders," the systems of ornament whose origins and maturation took place in stone post-and-lintel construction. Through the polis' patronage of architects, traditionally educated individuals from backgrounds outside construction, building projects visually unified the often politically disconnected city-states and the sanctuaries they shared by way of the orders as emphatically Panhellenic expressions. More than this, the experience of ordering architectural form provided the tools, techniques, metaphors, and cultural conditioning for seeing and envisioning order in the realms of philosophy and science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 2004 and 2009 the Bay of Iskenderun Landscape Archaeology and Survey Project conducted six seasons of survey, focusing on the Issos, Iskenderun, and Arsuz Plains.  In the course of our work, 200 archaeological sites were documented in this previously underexplored region of Cilicia.  Our surveys revealed that two neighboring sites, Dutlu Tarla and Dagilbaz Hoyuk, served as the principal settlements in the Iskenderun Plain during most of the Bronze And Iron Ages.  Considered together, they dominated the human landscape of this region for nearly three millennia.  In our contribution in honor of Marie-Henriette and Charles Gates, we present the results of our investigation at these two sister sites and their role in the Iskenderun Plain.  We also critique the various approaches we employed during the course of our investigations at these sites, which included both extensive and intensive survey methodologies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jill Kraye, Professor Emerita of the Warburg Institute, is renowned internationally for her scholarship on Renaissance philosophy and humanism. This volume pays tribute to her achievements with essays by friends, colleagues, and doctoral students—all leading scholars—on subjects as diverse as her work. Articles on canonical figures such as Marsilio Ficino and Justus Lipsius mix with more quirky pieces on alphabetic play and the Hippocratic aphorisms. Many chapters seek to bridge the divide between humanism and philosophy, including David Lines's survey of the way fifteenth-century humanists actually defined philosophy and Brian Copenhaver's polemical essay against the concept of humanist philosophy. The volume includes a full bibliography of Professor Kraye's scholarly publications.  Contributors are: Michael Allen, Daniel Andersson, Lilian Armstrong, Stefan Bauer, Dorigen Caldwell, Brian Copenhaver, Martin Davies, Germana Ernst, Guido Giglioni, Robert Goulding, Anthony Grafton, James Hankins, J. Cornelia Linde, David Lines, Margaret Meserve, John Monfasani, Anthony Ossa-Richardson, Jan Papy, Michael Reeve, Alessandro Scafi, and William Stenhouse.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume brings together a compendium of world-class research on English, from the Anglo-Saxons to Big Data. Selected from papers presented at the 2016 conference of the International Association of University Professors of English, the essays demonstrate the strength of English studies across the world, with contributions from scholars in China, Finland, Israel, Italy, Japan and Portugal, as well as from Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. The essays not only cross geographical boundaries, but also disciplinary ones. Contributors write about English through the prism of gender studies, history, linguistics, the digital humanities, theatre history and the history of the book; topics covered include mainstream writers such as Shakespeare and Milton, and shine light on less well-known topics such as Welsh poetry of the Wars of the Roses and captivity narratives in seventeenth-century North America. Bringing together perspectives on English from around the world, English Without Boundaries is a unique collection showing the energy and breadth of English studies today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>After 1750 the Americas lived political and popular revolutions, the fall of European empires, and the rise of nations as the world faced a new industrial capitalism. Political revolution made the United States the first new nation; revolutionary slaves made Haiti the second, freeing themselves and destroying the leading Atlantic export economy. A decade later, Bajío insurgents took down the silver economy that fueled global trade and sustained Spain's empire while Britain triumphed at war and pioneered industrial ways that led the U.S. South, still-Spanish Cuba, and a Brazilian empire to expand slavery to supply rising industrial centers. Meanwhile, the fall of silver left people from Mexico through the Andes searching for new states and economies. After 1870 the United States became an agro-industrial hegemon, and most American nations turned to commodity exports, while Haitians and diverse indigenous peoples struggled to retain independent ways.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book provides a systematic framework for the emerging field of Mediterranean studies, collecting essays from scholars of history, literature, religion, and art history that seek a more fluid understanding of "Mediterranean." It emphasizes the interdependence of Mediterranean regions and the rich interaction (both peaceful and bellicose, at sea and on land) between them. It avoids applying the national, cultural and ethnic categories that developed with the post-Enlightenment domination of northwestern Europe over the academy, working instead towards a dynamic and thoroughly interdisciplinary picture of the Mediterranean. Including an extensive bibliography and a conversation between leading scholars in the field, Can We Talk Mediterranean? lays the groundwork for a new critical and conceptual approach to the region.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book contains thirteen original essays about Puritan culture in colonial New England. Prompted by the growing interest in secular studies, as well as postnational, transnational, and postcolonial critique in the humanities, American Literature and the New Puritan Studies seeks to represent and advance contemporary interest in a field long recognized, however problematically, as foundational to the study of American literature. It invites readers of American literature and culture to reconsider the role of seventeenth-century Puritanism in the creation of the United States of America and its consequent cultural and literary histories. It also records the significant transformation in the field of Puritan studies that has taken place in the last quarter century. In addition to re-reading well known texts of seventeenth-century Puritan New England, the volume contains essays focused on unknown or lesser studied events and texts, as well as new scholarship on post-Puritan archives, monuments, and historiography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>European Empires in the American South examines the process of European expansion into a region that has come to be known as the American South. After Europeans began to cross the Atlantic with confidence, they interacted for three hundred years with one another, with the native people of the region, and with enslaved Africans in ways that made the South a significant arena of imperial ambition. As such, it was one of several similarly contested regions around the Atlantic basin. Without claiming that the South was unique during the colonial era, these essays make clear the region's integral importance for anyone seeking to shed new light on the long-term process of global social, cultural, and economic integration.   For those who are curious about how the broad processes of historical change influenced particular people and places, the contributors offer key examples of colonial encounter. This volume includes essays on all three imperial powers, Spain, Britain, and France, and their imperial projects in the American South. Engaging profitably--from the European perspective at least-- with Native Americans proved key to these colonial schemes. While the consequences of Indian encounters with European invaders have long remained a principal feature of historical research, this volume advances and expands knowledge of Native Americans in the South amid the Atlantic World.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Michael Lundblad's edited collection, Animalities, is a timely intervention in literary and cultural criticism, appearing at a moment when, as Lundblad points out, the burgeoning interdisciplinary fields of animal studies, critical animal studies, human-animal studies, and posthumanism are becoming increasingly prominent in mainstream academia. In his illuminating introduction to the volume, Lundblad pauses to reflect on the usefulness of a wildly varied area of study that incorporates wide-ranging, and often contradictory, methodological approaches and ideologies. This variety has an immediate impact, as Lundblad indicates, on the ever-evolving classificatory apparatus that is deployed to define interest in the animal, the human, and animal-human relations – in addition to those mentioned above, Lundblad also describes animality studies, humanimal studies, and species studies as producing a proliferating cloud of terminology (1). One aim of this book then, is not to contribute further to any diffusion of common interest, but instead to focus on ‘a set of dynamics that move beyond the human […] that construct animals, on the one hand, or humans in relation to animals, on the other hand, or both' (1–2). Lundblad identifies three primary ‘forms' scholarship takes, human-animal studies, animality studies, and posthumanism, and proceeds to provide a valuable distinction between the three. This introduction lays out a clear and precise context for what follows, but is not didactic in its operation – as Lundblad wisely emphasises, he has ‘resist[ed] the impulse' to label the work of his contributors (11).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay considers what are arguably the formative years of humanitarianism's "iconography of childhood" – the late 19th century through the two World Wars – in order to trace aspects of its historical development, paying particular attention to the visual and rhetorical practices of politically diverse actors in Britain, Europe, and the United States.   Its ambitions are modest, yet nonetheless essential:  First, to establish a loose chronology of when humanitarian imagery came to be dominated by a focus on the symbolic figure of the child. Second, to chart some visual tropes that informed, or emerged from, this practice in a range of distribution venues, including illustrated books, organizational newsletters, and pictorial magazines.  Third, to suggest the political valences of child-centered imagery as well as the extent to which it became a shared cultural strategy across media formats and political-ideological camps, in an extended era of World War (1910s-1940s).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>International response to unaccompanied migrant and refugee children has a century-long history. The construction of such children as a social problem requiring professionalized attention dates to the aftermath of the First World War and the rise of international social work for unaccompanied children separated from families by war, migration or displacement. This chapter forces on the work of the International Social Service, founded by female social workers from Europe and the US who worked collaboratively across national borders to develop and disseminate the professional methods, standards, and ethics – such as the modern casework method and a commitment to the "best interest of the child" – that continue to inform international child migration and relief work today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Sinop Regional Archaeological Project (SRAP) conducted its first two seasons of excavations at the site of Sinop Kalesi in July-August 2015 and 2016. The excavation builds on more than a decade of survey and environmental research in Sinop and ties in with the longer-term regional  project through ongoing environmental studies, ceramic analyses, and regional scale archaeological research. Sinop (ancient Sinope ) was one of the earliest Ionian Greek colonies in the Black Sea and the earliest colony on its Anatolian coast. The goals for these initial field seasons were to clarify the Iron Age and early colonial phases of settlement investigated by SRAP in 2000 (Doonan 2007), and to establish the stratigraphic relationship of the defensive wall to early colonial and pre-colonial phases of the site. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) investigations of Sinop Kalesi, carried out in December 2012, suggested that early strata should be accessible beneath a paved modern surface to the west of the city wall, so we concentrated efforts there in our initial season (Doonan et al. 2015).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholarship on Euripides' Alcestis has been principally concerned with genre and characterization. Attention to material objects in the play has focused on Admetus' infamous vow to have a likeness made of Alcestis' body so that he can embrace it in his bed (d?µa? t? s?? e??as???, 348-349). In this chapter, this likeness initiates a reading the play that exemplifies what I am calling tragedy's morbid materialism. The argument is indebted to two recent and related theoretical positions: Jane Bennett's defense of vital materialism on the one hand and Bonnie Honig's critique of mortalist humanism, on the other. The former introduces an argument for the singularity of the human corpse as an inanimate or post-animate object; the latter situates this singularity in terms of the shared finitude of living humans and non-living things. Together, these positions provide a theoretical basis for understanding the material, ontological, and epistemological effects of Alcestis' death and improbable return to life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract (148 words): This paper focuses on the ghost in tragedy as a singular instance of re-performance. The argument starts from two related premises. First, that as an embodied specter the tragic ghost emphasizes the temporal and ontological contingencies that define the relationship between a dramatic actor and his character. Second, that the tragic ghost is a figure for disavowing, i.e., both acknowledging and resisting, the finality of death. Following a discussion of dramatic imitation (µ?µ?s??) as a means of "leading souls" (???a????a) in Plato and Aristotle, I argue that re-performance is exemplified in the tragic ghost's uncanny return from the dead. Here re-performance is not a matter of theater history or reception but of dramatic µ?µ?s?? as the visible and audible return of the dead among the living. The chapter ends with an examination of this conclusion in a comparative reading of the ghosts in Euripides' Hecuba and Shakespeare's Hamlet.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although no German nation-state existed around 1800, German-speaking naturalists played an important role in the large-scale Pacific explorations that the major European powers launched between c. 1750 and 1830. While entangled in the interests of these powers, individuals such as Georg Steller, Georg Forster, Otto von Kotzebue, and others retained an intellectual independence.  They served as mediators between different cultures, created transnational networks of knowledge, and contributed to the global traffic of ideas and material objects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Zhao Gan's "Traveling along the River at First Snow" and Guo Zhongshu's "Traveling on the River in Clearing Snow" are among the notable landmarks in the history of Chinese painting for three good reasons:  First, both paintings carry a royal or imperial title inscription identifying the respective painter; second, the style of both paintings can be dated to the second half of the 10th century, seemingly in accord with the two painters' names both in the title inscriptions and in Northern Song art historical texts; lastly, both paintings are the earliest and most important surviving scrolls depicting "the landscape of towing boats along the river" (Mi Fu). This case study investigates the connections between the various images of towing boats along the river and the Southern Tang-Northern Song culture of political exile through the eye of the four preeminent scholar-official-poets Xu Xuan, Guo Zhongshu, Wang Yucheng, and Su Shi; in doing so, it explores the intersections of the various geo-political, socio-economic, intellectual and artistic forces of the period for an understanding of the process of making such exile landscape painting.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Covering the period 1520–1680, A Companion to Renaissance Poetry offers 46 essays which present an in-depth account of the context, production, and interpretation of early modern British poetry. It provides students with a deep appreciation for, and sensitivity toward, the ways in which poets of the period understood and fashioned a distinctly vernacular voice, while engaging them with some of the debates and departures that are currently animating the discipline.  A Companion to Renaissance Poetry analyzes the historical, cultural, political, and religious background of the time, addressing issues such as education, translation, the Reformation, theorizations of poetry, and more. The book immerses readers in non-dramatic poetry from Wyatt to Milton, focusing on the key poetic genres—epic, lyric, complaint, elegy, epistle, pastoral, satire, and religious poetry. It also offers an inclusive account of the poetic production of the period by canonical and less canonical writers, female and male. Finally, it offers examples of current developments in the interpretation of Renaissance poetry, including economic, ecological, scientific, materialist, and formalist approaches.  • Covers a wide selection of authors and texts  • Features contributions from notable authors, scholars, and critics across the globe  • Offers a substantial section on recent and developing approaches to reading Renaissance poetry  A Companion to Renaissance Poetry is an ideal resource for all students and scholars of the literature and culture of the Renaissance period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The "Crafty MISS" broadside ballad must have been popular enough that its title could be used as short-hand for an existing tune, which was titled originally either "Moggies Jealousie," or—if "Moggies Jealousie" also referred back to an even earlier popular broadside ballad, such as "You London Lads Be Merry"—an earlier title associated with the tune. In either case, by the 1680s, ballads relied upon the popularity of "The Crafty MISS" for both their performance in song and their marketing by that earlier ballad's name for the song. This essay takes these connections even further; it argues that "The Crafty MISS" ballad referenced by these other ballads is merely part of a late seventeenth-century trend for ballads about crafty women, a trend which highlights the performativity of gendered expectations alongside the commodification of gendered texts and bodies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Greensickness, when used as a medical term in the early modern period, demonstrated the status of the female body as a cultural cipher. The disease allowed physicians and parents to read a daughter's unmarried state as physically harmful, thereby justifying the cultural injunction to marry. According to early modern physicians, greensickness was a "disease of virgins" for which the best cure was sexual intercourse within marriage. By pathologizing virginity, diagnoses of greensickness reflect the shift from valuing virginity to valuing Protestant marriage for women in early modern England.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume analyzes early modern cultural representations of children and childhood through the literature and drama of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Contributors include leading international scholars of the English Renaissance whose essays consider asexuals and sodomites, roaring girls and schoolboys, precocious princes and raucous tomboys, boy actors and female apprentices, while discussing a broad array of topics, from animal studies to performance theory, from queer time to queer fat, from teaching strategies to casting choices, and from metamorphic sex changes to rape and cannibalism. The collection interrogates the cultural and historical contingencies of childhood in an effort to expose, theorize, historicize, and explicate the spectacular queerness of early modern dramatic depictions of children.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Queer Shakespeare: Desire and Sexuality draws together 13 essays, which offer a major reassessment of the criticism of desire, body and sexuality in Shakespeare's drama and poetry. Bringing together some of the most prominent critics working at the intersection of Shakespeare criticism and queer theory, this collection demonstrates the vibrancy of queer Shakespeare studies. Taken together, these essays explore embodiment, desire, sexuality and gender as key objects of analyses, producing concepts and ideas that draw critical energy from focused studies of time, language and nature. The Afterword extends these inquiries by linking the Anthropocene and queer ecology with Shakespeare criticism. Works from Shakespeare's entire canon feature in essays which explore topics like glass, love, antitheatrical homophobia, size, narrative, sound, female same-sex desire and Petrarchism, weather, usury and sodomy, male femininity and male-to-female crossdressing, contagion, and antisocial procreation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter offers a South Asian history of the disagreement about how best to handle scientific expertise in the criminal courtroom. The debate comparing adversarialism and inquisitorialism had long raged in Anglo-American and European settings. Was it best to rely on the single court-appointed expert (inquisitorialism from Roman law in continental Europe), or to hear partisan experts present competing and often contradictory views in the "marketplace of ideas" (Anglo adversarialism)? The debate took on new shape in colonial India. When dominated by British figures like Punjab Chemical Examiner William Center in the 1870s and High Court judge Douglas Young in the 1930s, both sides of the debate absorbed colonial stereotypes reflecting the perceived imperatives of British rule. With the rise of South Asians in the professions (both legal and scientific), the colonial stereotype of "native mendacity" fell out of the debate. Medical jurisprudence treatise author J. P. Modi (from the 1920s on) and Madras High Court judge P. N. Ramaswami (1955) shed earlier English and colonial associations around the adversarial-inquisitorial debate. All sides worried about the risk of falsity and wrongful convictions—whether caused by competing partisan experts, the unaccountable solo lab expert, "native mendacity," or judicially unsupervised police. At issue were questions about the viability and mechanics of the search for truth across professionalized fields of knowledge in a once-colonial context. The chapter is also a story about colonial continuities, because the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure that allowed lab experts to act as court-appointed experts without being cross-examined (s.510) lives on into the present, even after its colonial rationale had fallen away.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines the phenomenon of counterinsurgency as a form of militarized development.  It is particularly interested in the social and spatial dimensions of counterinsurgency, and in the ways in which counterinsurgency theorists and practitioners seek to construct, manipulate and control populations and spaces.  It considers these practices in a particular historical context: the province of B?n Tre in South Vietnam, in the years leading up to a famous uprising organized by communist partisans in 1960.  The evidence presented here—drawn from South Vietnamese government records and communist accounts—shows that the government's initial apparent successes in pacification in B?n Tre and its subsequent failure to anticipate or prevent the 1960 uprising turned mainly on its development schemes, such as its ill-fated Agroville Program, launched in 1959.  By analyzing space and spatial practices as foundational elements of counterinsurgency, historians can better understand the ways in which counterinsurgency wars often combine ever more ambitious development schemes with increasingly destructive uses of military force.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As part of an initiative to enhance the humanities' use of emerging technologies, the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures at Old Dominion University is currently developing strategies for incorporating the use of podcasting—disseminating audio programming over the Internet—in its foreign language curricula and is studying podcasting's effects on foreign language teaching and learning. The academic use of podcasting allows for 24/7 accessibility and portability of the teaching and learning experience, while enabling on-demand learner control and personalization (Lee &amp;amp; Chan, 2007). It permits the restructuring of valuable classroom time and can convert the popular iPod and other MP3 players into multipurpose teaching and learning tools that can be used to reinforce class content, to improve pronunciation and vocabulary, and to improve oral and aural skills. The early results of this pilot project suggest that podcasting has positive effects on students' learning outcomes and study habits.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"The ‘Near Enemy' of Equality: Richard Wright, Flannery O'Connor, and Cold War Civil Rights," included in a collection on author Flannery O'Connor forthcoming from University Press of Mississippi, offers a new and bracing alignment between the aims of authors Flannery O'Connor and Richard Wright, in the context of racial and economic politics during the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. This is the first scholarly work to consider these authors as having resonant aims, both in terms of their fiction's progressive political commitments, and regarding the "Christ-haunted" view of human rights they share.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A study of the postwar French crime procedural (or policier), using the perspective of American-versus-French entertainment models to understand the pleasures and textual allure of the heist setpiece.  Long overlooked or ignored by film historians, the popular sector of postwar French cinema actually offers evidence of France's film stylisticians at their most refined and self-reflexive.  In fact, the central heist robbery sequence of the policier genre is akin, this chapter argues, to the most elegant of classical Hollywood's musical numbers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter considers the lost generation of postwar French film short filmmakers, essayists and documentarians, whose work probed issues of national memory and remembrance.  The account favors especially those women film practitioners (notably Yannick Bellon and Jacqueline Jacoupy) whose work has been written out of traditional film histories.  Surveying a decade of postwar French film, the chapter analyzes how representative filmmakers (Bellon, Alain Resnais, Rene Vautier, and others) created exposes of memory, either focused on individuals (like the artist Colette) or regions (like the Aubervillier district of Paris) or forbidden zones (France's colonialist holdings in then-French West Africa) could be revived, represented, and belatedly debated on-screen.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book provides an in-depth and comprehensive state-of-the-art study of 'African languages' and 'language in Africa' since its beginnings as a 'colonial science' at the turn of the twentieth century in Europe. Compiled by 56 internationally renowned scholars, this ground breaking study looks at past and current research on 'African languages' and 'language in Africa' under the impact of paradigmatic changes from 'colonial' to 'postcolonial' perspectives. It addresses current trends in the study of the role and functions of language, African and other, in pre- and postcolonial African societies. Highlighting the central role that the 'language factor' plays in postcolonial transformation processes of sociocultural modernization and economic development, it also addresses more recent, particularly urban, patterns of communication, and outlines applied dimensions of digitalization and human language technology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>En este trabajo proponemos una reconstrucción del inventario fonémico del protototonaco-tepehua (ptt). La familia totonaco-tepehua se encuentra en la parte central de México en la región que incluye parte de tres estados –el sur de Hidalgo, la Sierra Norte de Puebla y el noroeste de Veracruz. La familia está constituida por dos ramas: la totonaca, que cuenta con unos 244 033 hablantes, y la tepehua, con unos 8868 hablantes (inegi 2010). El enfoque principal de este trabajo es proponer que la protolengua incluía una serie de oclusivas y africadas glotalizadas y que no incluía una serie de vocales laringizadas. Además proponemos que el inventario fonémico del protototonaco-tepehua incluía un cierre glotal y una sola fricativa velar/posvelar.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Empire of the Senses brings together pathbreaking scholarship on the role the five senses played in early America. With perspectives from across the hemisphere, exploring individual senses and multi-sensory frameworks, the volume explores how sensory perception helped frame cultural encounters, colonial knowledge, and political relationships. From early French interpretations of intercultural touch, to English plans to restructure the scent of Jamaica, these essays elucidate different ways the expansion of rival European empires across the Americas involved a vast interconnected range of sensory experiences and practices. Empire of the Senses offers a new comparative perspective on the way European imperialism was constructed, operated, implemented and, sometimes, counteracted by rich and complex new sensory frameworks in the diverse contexts of early America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Behind our contemporary experience of globalization, precarity, and consumerism lies a history of colonization, increasing literacy, transnational trade in goods and labor, and industrialization. Teaching British laboring-class literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries means exploring ideas of class, status, and labor in relation to the historical developments that inform our lives as workers and members of society. This volume demonstrates pedagogical techniques and provides resources for students and teachers on autobiographies, broadside ballads, Chartism and other political movements, georgics, labor studies, satire, service learning, writing by laboring-class women, and writing by laboring people of African descent.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay studies several unpublished poems, and in some cases unknown, written in the Spanish Philippines in the first Baroque moment. Some of them are early imitations of Góngora's aesthetics that predate the first known Gongorine texts in New Spain. Through the analysis of a small corpus of texts, which includes the first known collection of Philippine poetry, transcribed by soldier Diego de Rueda y Mendoza in 1625, and a piscatory eclogue written by the Jesuit ethnographer Francisco Ignacio de Alcina (1668), this chapter analyzes the globalization of Góngora's lyric discourse, its significant presence in the Philippine republic of letters, and the social uses of his poetics in colonial Manila.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter provides an overview of various forms of human bondage, touching upon several important characteristics of slavery and slave trading present throughout documented history, from the ancient period to the early twentieth century. It highlights the common attributes of the institution of slavery across cultures, and describes the contexts in which the enslavement and trafficking of men, women, and children has persisted over the centuries. Slavery has existed in many places and in multiple forms for thousands of years and is one of most extreme forms of human domination. As a long-standing worldwide phenomenon, the institution of slavery has impacted millions of lives, and the pervasiveness of slavery throughout human history makes it difficult to generalize about the experience of bondage for individual. Slavery existed in ancient Rome from its earliest stage of development, and as the Roman Republic expanded into a vast empire over a period of several centuries, it became the largest slave society in ancient world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Alejandro de la Fuente and George Reid Andrews offer the first systematic, book-length survey of humanities and social science scholarship on the exciting field of Afro-Latin American studies. Organized by topic, these essays synthesize and present the current state of knowledge on a broad variety of topics, including Afro-Latin American music, religions, literature, art history, political thought, social movements, legal history, environmental history, and ideologies of racial inclusion. This volume connects the region's long history of slavery to the major political, social, cultural, and economic developments of the last two centuries. Written by leading scholars in each of those topics, the volume provides an introduction to the field of Afro-Latin American studies that is not available from any other source and reflects the disciplinary and thematic richness of this emerging field.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Featuring a variety of disciplinary perspectives and analytical approaches, Celluloid Chains is the most comprehensive volume to date on films about slavery. This collection examines works from not only the United States but elsewhere in the Americas, and it attests to slavery's continuing importance as a source of immense fascination for filmmakers and their audiences.  Each of the book's fifteen original essays focuses on a particular film that directly treats the enslavement of Africans and their descendants in the New World. Beginning with an essay on the Cuban film El otro Francisco (1975), Sergio Giral's reworking of a nineteenth-century abolitionist novel, the book proceeds to examine such works as the landmark miniseries Roots (1977), which sparked intense controversy over its authenticity; Werner Herzog's Cobra Verde (1987), which raises questions about what constitutes a slavery film; Guy Deslauriers's Passage du milieu (1999), a documentary-style reconstruction of what Africans experienced during the Middle Passage; and Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave (2013), which embodies the tensions between faithfully adapting a nineteenth-century slave narrative and bending it for modern purposes.  Films about slavery have shown a special power to portray the worst and best of humanity, and Celluloid Chains is an essential guide to this important genre.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Translators' contribution to the vitality of textual production in the Renaissance is still often vastly underestimated. Drawing on a wide variety of sources published in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, German, English, and Zapotec, this volume brings a global perspective to the history of translators, and the printed book. Together the essays point out the extent to which particular language cultures were liable to shift, overlap, shrink, and expand during one of the most defining periods in the history of print culture. Interdisciplinary in approach, Trust and Proof investigates translators' role in the diffusion of discourse about languages and ancient knowledge, as well as changing etiquettes of reading and writing.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter looks closely at John Bunyan's first major narrative, his conversion account Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), exploring interwoven qualities of intense religious confession, especially the deep sense of sinful guilt; metaphorical vitality drawn from Bunyan's local experience in Bedfordshire; animated, personified, medicinal citation of the Bible (and other pious books); modes of social abjection; and pursuit of the authority to speak. Grace Abounding was composed when Bunyan was in prison under the terms of the 1664 Conventicle Act, and hence he was using the conversion narrative as a kind of published sermon. Later revisions reduced or erased traces of his earlier religious radicalism, and demonstrated his growing competence as minister and writer, but sometimes compromised authentically remembered spontaneous experience</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One way forward with English literature in the period is to understand its relationship with the other vernacular literatures of western and central Europe and the colonies of the polities. Many English poets were aware of the politics and sociology of the continental poets, the contexts in which they wrote. Most of the poetry written by Andrew Marvell about the sea is his poetry about the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the three somewhat religious but mostly political and mercantile conflicts of 1651-54, 1664-67, and 1672-74. Not only is Marvell to be considered as a kind of poet in an international context, also his public poetry is part of an international and sometimes highly contested literary arena. To dignify vernacular English by imitating the best examples in antiquity and in Renaissance Italy was no longer the preoccupation for Marvell's generation, or a poet like Marvell, however much it remained a potent force.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter explores the significance of the appearance of Greville's Life of Sidney in 1651 and his Remains, the poetic treatises on monarchy and religion in 1670. The Life of Sidney appeared as in favour of mixed monarchy held up by a virtuous aristocracy against the tyranny of the interregnum government, while the Remains offers virtuous, consultative monarchy, fully invested in ‘popularity', against tyranny and in full favour of toleration. This complex picture stands against the dark machinations of the Cabal government in 1670, in which Charles II played off his Privy Council advisers one against another. Greville's poems are a very Protestant poetic attack upon various kinds of idolatry, so that they line up well with the iconoclasm of Milton's Paradise Lost, which had recently appeared, and not at all well with the indubitably royalist, conformist identity of their publisher.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay begins recalling its original moment and place of delivery as a conference paper at St Giles's House, seat of the Earls of Shaftesbury, begun in March 1650 by Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, later Baron Ashley and first Earl of Shaftesbury.1 In it, I make some points of connection on the levels of political thought, religious identity, aesthetic philosophy, poetry, and material culture between the careers and writings of the first and third Earls of Shaftesbury, and what by 1700 had become known as a Whig literature, where the poetry and prose of Andrew Marvell played a key role. Marvell's poetry, as opposed to his prose, may be seen as a link between the career and interests of the first Earl and the aesthetic ideas of the third.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the middle of the twentieth century, a new class of marketing expert emerged beyond the familiar ad men of Madison Avenue. Working as commercial designers, consumer psychologists, sales managers, and market researchers, these professionals were self-defined "consumer engineers," and their rise heralded a new era of marketing. To what extent did these efforts to engineer consumers shape consumption practices? And to what extent was the phenomenon itself a product of broader social and cultural forces? This collection considers consumer engineering in the context of the longer history of transatlantic marketing. Contributors offer case studies on the roles of individual consumer engineers on both sides of the Atlantic, the impact of such marketing practices on European economies during World War II and after, and the conflicted relationship between consumer activists and the ideas of consumer engineering. By connecting consumer engineering to a web of social processes in the twentieth century, this volume contributes to a reassessment of consumer history more broadly.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Copy Culture: Sharing in the Age of Digital Reproduction explores how digital tools are revolutionizing the cultural heritage landscape through copies. Every day, museums, institutions and individuals alike are digitizing more and more of our global cultural heritage, resulting in vast databases of high-resolution images, 3D models and other forms of digital reproductions. These copies are being shared like never before, reading new audiences around the world, inspiring creativity, enabling learning and aiding preservation.Through essays, interviews and project profiles, the book draws from a cross-disciplinary group of experts to better understand the challenges and opportunities for making, storing, sharing and using digital reproductions, in museums and in everyday life.Copy Culture is a result of ReACH (Reproductions of Art and Cultural Heritage), an initiative spearheaded by the Victoria and Albert Museum with the Peri Foundation, to bring museums and cultural heritage practitioners together to collectively draw a roadmap for the future production and use of digital copies.Contributions by Anaïs Aguerre, Eugene Ch'ng, Chance Coughenour, Marion Crick, Abrahgam Drassinower, David Gissen, Laura Jones, Mari Lending, Adam Lowe, Mark Mudge, Wim Pijbes, Vernon Rapley, Loic Tallon, Merete Sanderhoff, Carla Schroer, Sandra L.

		<Abstract>Competition for resources (arable land, pasturage) within settled farming populations became increasingly intensive as those populations grew. One strong measure to reduce the tensions that might lead to conflicts over such commodified aspects of the environment was the development of corporate kinship groups that established exclusive access to certain land parcels (among other resources) to their members; abiotic resources were also claimed exclusively, such as names, symbols, and myths. A cor-related development was the expression of corporate identities, signs that distinguished one corporate group from all others. While many of those signs may have been lost to prehistorians, others have survived. The site of ‘Ain Ghazal provides good evidence of such corporate identities as reflected in architectural clustering and ritual practices, particularly during the Middle PPNB (MPPNB) and Late PPNB (LPPNB) periods.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The early evolution of human ancestry occurred in Africa, and sometime near the Plio-Pleistocene boundary members of Homo erectus grade first ventured outside the African continent. The migration must have passed through southwestern Asia, marking the beginning of a long and gradual evolution both physically and culturally in what is today the southern Levant. Although evidence for the earliest emergence into the region is rare, recent advances in chronometric dating have placed the changing trajectories of both cultural and physical evolution on firmer foundations. The ensuing developments have become more numerous, continuous, and understandable during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic periods through the disappearance of Archaic Homo sapiens at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, some 45,000 years ago.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Eastern Badia Archaeological Project (EBAP) began in- tensive investigation of two sites in the basalt ?elds of Jordan's panhandle in 2008 (Fig. 1). Surveys [Rollefson et al. 2014; Rowan et al. 2014] and subsequent excavations were undertaken at the southwestern edge of the basalt in the Wadi al-Qattafi, located about 60 km ESE of North Azraq [Rollefson et al. 2017] and at Wisad Pools, an additional 60 km east of Qattafi at the eastern edge of the harra [Rollefson et al. 2011; Rowan et al. 2015]. While the EBAP investigations at both sites are continuing, sufficient samples of stone tool production allow for a preliminary interpretation of the lithic technology and behavior of the residents of these sites that spanned more than a millennium (~6,600-5400 calBC) during the Late Neolithic period. Cores provide basic insights into how strategies of core reduction affect the production of blanks and tools and how these strategies may have evolved over time [e.g. Barket 2016:306-307]. That is the focus of this study: examining patterns of lithic  production by looking at cores recovered from structures W-66 [cf. Rollefson et al. 2012] and from W-80 [Rollefson et al. 2015] at Wisad Pools.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The second half of the seventh millennium BC saw the demise of the previously affluent and dynamic Neolithic way of life. The period is marked by significant social and economic transformations of local communities, as manifested in a new spatial organization, patterns of architecture, burial practices, and in chipped stone and pottery manufacture. This volume has three foci. The first concerns the character of these changes in different parts of the Near East with a view to placing them in a broader comparative perspective. The second concerns the social and ideological changes that took place at the end of Neolithic and the beginning of the Chalcolithic that help to explain the disintegration of constitutive principles binding the large centers, the emergence of a new social system, as well as the consequences of this process for the development of full-fledged farming communities in the region and beyond. The third concerns changes in lifeways: subsistence strategies, exploitation of the environment, and, in particular, modes of procurement, consumption, and distribution of different resources.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Known in England as the Circassian wife of Robert Sherley—the Sussex adventurer who served as Shah 'Abbas I's ambassador to Europe during the early decades of the seventeenth century—Teresa Sampsonia Sherley was often lionized on the Continent because of her travel exploits in unfamiliar and often hostile environments. Drawing on archival research as well as hitherto ignored early print sources, Nocentelli argues that Lady Sampsonia Sherley's travel adventures helped theorize female mobility as an enterprise that could be respectable and even exemplary.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Book abstract:  The growth of institutional capacity in the developing world has become a central theme in twenty-first-century social science. Many studies have shown that public institutions are an important determinant of long-run rates of economic growth. This book argues that to understand the difficulties and pitfalls of state building in the contemporary world, it is necessary to analyze previous efforts to create institutional capacity in conflictive contexts. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the process of state and nation building in Latin America and Spain from independence to the 1930s. The book examines how Latin American countries and Spain tried to build modern and efficient state institutions for more than a century - without much success. The Spanish and Latin American experience of the nineteenth century was arguably the first regional stage on which the organizational and political dilemmas that still haunt states were faced. This book provides an unprecedented perspective on the development and contemporary outcome of those state and nation-building projects.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Online Finding Aid for the Archivo General de Centro América will provide increased ways for researchers to identify documents of interest in a widely distributed microfilm copy of this primary resource for the history of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Chiapas (Mexico). The original archive, located in Guatemala, houses approximately 147,000 registered document collections from the colonial period, ranging in date from the 16th century to independence from Spain in 1821. The microfilm copy, composed of almost 4,000 reels of microfilm, is organized according to basic keywords designating the original province in colonial Guatemala, a year, and a subject-matter keyword. Also associated in the basic records of the finding aid (which are already available online) are the reference number assigned each document in the original archive, and the specific reel(s) on which it is found. With funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, enhanced records are being created for documents dating between 1700 and 1821 identified as associated with Guatemala, the administrative heart of the colony, for which there are no published indices. Enhanced records add names of people and places not recorded in the original record, opening up the microfilm collection, and through it, the original archive, to broader social history including studies of the roles of women, indigenous people, and African-descendant people.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Contemporary Archaeology and the City' foregrounds the archaeological study of post-industrial and other urban transformations through a diverse, international collection of case studies. Over the past decade contemporary archaeology has emerged as a dynamic force for dissecting and contextualizing the material complexities of present-day societies. In doing so it challenges conventional anthropological and archaeological conceptions of the past by pushing temporal boundaries closer to, if not into, the present. The volume is organized around three themes that highlight the multifaceted character of urban life in present-day cities--creativity, ruination, and political action. The case studies in this volume offer comparative perspectives on transformative global, urban processes in local contexts, including the struggling, post-industrial cities of Detroit, Belfast, Indianapolis, Berlin, Liverpool, Bele´m, and post-apartheid Cape Town, as well as the thriving urban centres of Melbourne, New York City, London, Chicago, and Istanbul. Contributions demonstrate how the contemporary city is a palimpsest composed of archaeological assemblages--of the built environment, the surfaces, and buried subsurface--that retain traces of the various pasts entangled with one another in the present. This volume positions the city as one of the most important and dynamic arenas for archaeological studies of the contemporary by dissecting and reconceptualizing some of the major theoretical and methodological issues currently facing socially-engaged archaeologists</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Britain in the World" presents highlights from the collection of the Yale Center for British Art. Included alongside iconic works -- such as George Stubbs's "Zebra," Sir Joshua Reynolds's "Miss Prue," and J. M. W. Turner's "Dort" -- are diverse and fascinating objects that range from the Tudor period to the present day. This beautifully illustrated volume offers a valuable glimpse into the Center's vast and varied holdings. It also reveals British art as a global phenomenon, shaped and characterized by cultural exchange, exploration, scientific discovery, and, crucially, by the long history of colonialism and empire. This book illustrates the myriad ways in which visible and invisible global connections are present in the visual and material culture of Britain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Depictions of the Holocaust in history, literature, and film became a focus of intense academic debate in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, with the passing of the eyewitness generation and the rise of comparative genocide studies, the Holocaust's privileged place not only in scholarly discourse but across Western society has been called into question.  Probing the Ethics of Holocaust Culture is a searching reappraisal of the debates and controversies that have shaped Holocaust studies over a quarter century. This landmark volume brings international scholars of the founding generation of Holocaust studies into conversation with a new generation of historians, artists, and writers who have challenged the limits of representation through their scholarly and cultural practices. Focusing on the public memorial cultures, testimonial narratives, and artifacts of cultural memory and history generated by Holocaust remembrance, the volume examines how Holocaust culture has become institutionalized, globalized, and variously contested. Organized around three interlocking themes—the stakes of narrative, the remediation of the archive, and the politics of exceptionality—the essays in this volume explore the complex ethics surrounding the discourses, artifacts, and institutions of Holocaust remembrance.  From contrasting viewpoints and, in particular, from the multiple perspectives of genocide studies, the authors question if and why the Holocaust should remain the ultimate test case for ethics and a unique reference point for how we understand genocide and crimes against humanity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper addresses the ideological role of archaeology during the early decades of the French conquest of territory of Algeria and the appropriation of the prehistoric and Roman past by French archaeologists in the newly created European colony. By focusing on the period between 1830 and 1870, the years when colonial Algeria fell under the authority of the Minister of War, I draw attention to the inherent problems of the traditional telling of the history of classical archaeology in North Africa divorced from the context of the war since most of those involved also served as officers in the French army. In particular, I focus on the marked absence of indigenous Arab and Berber witnesses from the history of archaeology in Algeria, which is much in contrast to recent studies of Egyptian and Tunisian excavations, where locals played a much more active role in roughly the same time period. Given the nature of the violence of the French conquest, and the way in which documentation was selectively assembled in the French military archives, the lack of Algerian voices is not particularly surprising. I argue that indigenous voices presented an obstacle to the image of the Roman past created by French officers and archaeologists since Arab and Berber villages and encampments offered an alternative interpretation of an enduring legacy. This essay thus attempts to understand better the mechanisms by which these narratives about the North African past were silenced.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The conventional perspective that fear is a bad motivator for behavioral change, so critical to public health, is both an empirical observation and a moral judgment. This chapter challenges the belief that fear cannot work and is, indeed, counterproductive. The chapter then turns to the ethical debate, which for years was shaped by bioethics. The chapter concludes by arguing that the perspective of bioethics, so centrally concerned with the individual, provides an inadequate moral frame for thinking about fear-based campaigns. Instead, the chapter proposes the notion of public health ethics, which has as its grounding principle the enhancement of population well-being. Fear-based campaigns may be morally legitimate once the population benefits are clearly articulated and the potential social costs carefully evaluated in a process that is open, transparent, and engages the populations toward whom fear-based campaigns will be directed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Fairchild and Johns undertake a theoretical and empirical consideration of mass infectious disease panics in the United States. They argue that contemporary concerns about panic rehearse earlier experiences of panic. Adapting the notion of the "social drama" developed by the cultural anthropologist Victor Turner, they propose the "panic drama" as a means of elucidating the "script" that underlies late nineteenth and twentieth-century panic responses. Through the lenses of yellow fever, influenza, smallpox, swine flu, and biowarfare (later called bioterrorism), they show how panic has been bound "into the very construction of epidemics." Their purpose is to trace how the "panic drama" has been modified over more than a century, with dramatic components reconfigured—as well as examining the shifting role that institutions and authority have played in this process—while the basic panic narrative has been maintained.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay explores the careers of four Indian-born Mughal scholars who used Persian literary skills to achieve great professional success in the seventeenth century. Examining their relationship to provincial, imperial, and emigre literary networks in Lahore reveals the varied ways in which self-fashioning, professional rivalries, and self-promotion animated the acquisition and perpetuation of Persian scholarship in the Mughal Empire. The shift of this literary collective towards prose and pedagogical works in Persian indicates the ways in which professional success in literary domains depended crucially on access to specific social networks, and an awareness of the new opportunities available to scholars in provincial networks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Allison Busch places Padmakar Bhatt and his Himmatbahadurvirudavali in the context of the literary and political imaginary of the eighteenth century. She shows how Padmakar inherits the genre of the virudavali (itself a multi-faceted tradition) from Sanskrit, but also a rich lexicon from the vernacular, Arabic, and Persian. The form and language of his work thus reflect the changed political and cultural realities of his time. The seamless movement between modes of versified poetic description in the Himmatbahadurvirudavali reflects Padmakar's simultaneous function as both historian and poet.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Le ricerche archeologiche condotte a partire dal 2014 nel sito della città romana di Salapia (Cerignola, FG), hanno consentito di aprire una finestra di studio su un comparto centrale del municipium che, alla fine del I secolo a.C., M(arcus) Hostilius rifondò sulle sponde del bacino lagunare oggi ricalcato dall'invaso delle Saline di Margherita di Savoia (DE VENUTO et al. 2015; IID. 2016; IID. 2017; fig. 1).  Nell'area delle insulae XII, XVI e XIX  gli scavi hanno portato alla luce una domus e due edifici adiacenti (Edificio A e B) con fasi di vita e uso comprese tra il tardo I e il IV secolo d.C.; un nucleo di tabernae; una piccola conceria, annessa alla domus. Le ricerche hanno inoltre evidenziato come alla destrutturazione dell'impianto urbano romano, tra tardo V e VI secolo, fosse seguita l'organizzazione di uno spazio frequentato sino alla fine dell'VIII secolo d.C. A partire dal 2017, l'indagine si è estesa anche al Monte di Salpi, l'altura posizionata al centro del pianoro terrazzato che si affaccia sul bacino delle saline e incombe sull'area interessata dalla città romana. Sulla sommità di questa collina, la cartografia storica e le fonti scritte localizzano l'abitato di Salpi, civitas attestata nelle fonti documentarie a partire dal 1074, tra i principali centri del Tavoliere meridionale sino al suo abbandono, nella seconda metà del XVI secolo.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Zoo Studies considers the modern zoo from a range of approaches and disciplines, united in a desire to blur the boundaries between human and nonhuman animals. The volume begins with an account of the first modern mental hospital, La Salpêtrière, established in 1656, and the first panoptical zoo, the menagerie at Versailles, created in 1662 by the same royal architect; the final chapter presents a choreographic performance that imagines the Toronto Zoo as a place where the human body can be inspired by animal bodies. From beginning to end, through interdisciplinary collaboration, this volume decentres the human subject and offers alternative ways of thinking about zoos and their inhabitants. This collection immerses readers in the lives of animals and their experiences of captivity and asks us to reflect on our own assumptions about both humans and animals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Initially explored by pioneering underwater archaeologist Gerhard Kapitän in the 1960s, the famous 6th-c. AD ‘church wreck' at Marzamemi (Sicily)—with its cargo of prefabricated religious architectural elements—holds a special place in discussions of the ancient stone transport and late antique exchange. Renewed investigations aim to shed light on the broader socioeconomic and historical circumstances surrounding the shipment, including patterns of maritime connectivity between the divergent east and west and the possible roles of imperial agency and local patronage in ambitious architectural programs. Critical to these questions are the origin and destination for the cargo. Stable isotope analysis offers a window into the geographic range of resources available for this architectural program and, by extension, possible clues to the organization of materials, labor, and sponsorship. Analysis of the historical and architectural context allows evaluation of plausible destinations. This study opens new possibilities for interpreting the social and political world of 6th-century exchange and a re-evaluation of the multifaceted relationship between Justinian and the recently acquired imperial lands.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Examines the native group in Pennsylvania known as the Susquehannocks, who were encountered by Europeans when they first entered the Susquehanna Valley. The studies presented draw on recent archaeological excavation and analyses to provide new perspectives on the Susquehannocks. A successor to Barry Kent's classic work on the Susquehannock, probably the least known of the northern Iroquoian people. Building on Kent's original synthesis, this volume adds important new information and offers a range of analytical perspectives. This volume brings us up to date not only on Susquehannock people and their culture, but also on how archaeology is being practiced in the twenty-first century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In a letter he wrote in Latin in 1663, an American Indian student at Harvard College named Caleb Cheeshahteaumauk thanks his "honorable benefactors" and begins with the ancient Greco-Roman mythological figure of Orpheus. In this article I first give the Latin text of the letter and my English translation, and then analyze the text in depth, reading it as a complex expression of both change and continuity at the pen of a young Wampanoag in a turbulent colonial situation, and as an illustration of several ways in which Greco-Roman antiquity has been transformed over the centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The slave trade, which transported Africans to the Americas, created a special relationship between the continents, resulting in a "Black Atlantic" culture. This investigation into the transference of carnival between West Africa and Bahia demonstrates one aspect of Black Atlantic culture and the importance of studying Fancy Dress as an element in a vast network of creative energy. Fancy Dress demonstrates the migration of costume aesthetics, fancy and fierce characters, and performed spiritual reverence and political resistance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Fancy Dress in Ghana is greatly indebted to both African masquerade and Black Atlantic carnivals. It was the thousands of Africans who were forcibly transported to the Americas in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries who developed the first Black Atlantic carnivals, a new art form resulting from the mixing of African and European performance traditions. Carnival then traveled to African ports during colonialism in the late-nineteenth century where it was mixed again with local African practices. Black Atlantic carnivals share traits inherited from the overturning of their socio-political world and to form a unique bond. Because performance aspires to both replace the old and embody something new, black carnivals emphasize the link to modernity while unraveling its connection to Western ideas of racism and civilization. Therefore, carnival is an amorphic art form that flows across oceans and continents that was and continues to be employed to heal cultural and political trauma in the Black Atlantic.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To confront these issues and the dynamic audio landscape podcasting affords, this book brings together contributions from a number of leading and emerging scholars in podcasting and digital audio in the hopes of taking stock of podcasting's recent history and imagining future directions for the format. We trace some of the less amplified histories of the format and offer discussions of some of the theoretical and cultural hurdles podcasting faces nearly 20 years into its existence. The questions our authors ask are sometimes technical or aesthetic - What sonic practices are unique to podcasts? What does a shift away from RSS feeds to streaming services mean for podcasting? What is the production quality of various shows and how does this affect the overall aesthetic of individual podcasts? - but they also cultural and social - What voices are highlighted or silenced in podcasts versus other media? What reconfigurations between producers and audiences are taking place in podcasts? What are the economics that underpin this largely un-monetized circulation of audio content?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this chapter, then, I want to consider two of the podcast industry's attempts to alter or move on from the advertising model that has dominated the medium's first decade- plus of existence—Panoply's Megaphone advertising service and Stitcher Premium's subscription model. What interests me most about these two innovations is how they alter our understanding of the history of podcasting and raise questions as to how podcast networks, other corporate entities, independent podcasters, and academics should aim to archive podcasts. Podcast advertisements have been an especially privileged paratext, but both of these innovations unsettle the advertisement's prominent placement in the podcast text. As corporate entities such as Stitcher Premium begin to place old episodes behind paywalls and academic archives such as the one that gives this book its namesake aim to freely preserve podcasts and their accompanying metadata for researchers, the history of podcasts, as recent as it may be, has begun to prove valuable for both business and academic purposes. I argue that podcast advertising should be an integral component of the archived podcast if future historians wish to truly understand the workings of the podcast text, industry, and audience in its first "Golden Age," outlining potential avenues of scholarship by raising questions from the perspectives of both the archivist and the researcher.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay seeks to recoup and amplify some of those voices. In the context of the evolving professionalization of podcasting, I examine the cultural divide emerging in the post-Serial podcasting world between public radio and commercial interests on one side ("pro-casters") and communities of independent audio producers ("podcasters") on the other. Looking specifically at female independent podcasters, I discuss the contours of their production culture and the concerns of these producers as podcasting became commercialized. The distinctive production cultures generated by "podcasters as bloggers"- perhaps imperfect, done piece-meal, at the hands of a distracted producer, and without priority - are far different than those offered in the offices of NPR or in the garages of male amateurs. For some "stay-at-home" podcasters, I analyze how discussions about podcast production align with the demands of care work and family life for women as imagined within contemporary discourses of neoliberal feminism. Through an analysis of one of many distinctive subcultures marginalized in early accounts of podcasting's origins, we can glimpse how the pursuit of perfect audio and commercial success influence the stories that journalists and scholars choose to tell about podcasting. "Tidying up" the histories of this young medium is essential work with material effects. The ways we compose narratives about the development of podcasting privileges certain voices and mutes others. Refusing to interrogate the ideologies and contexts in which we produce histories, I argue, not only erases some women's voices in podcasting's past, but may limit their possibilities in podcasting's future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter will begin with a close examination of the structure and functionality of the RSS feed and explore how RSS, more than anything else, shaped the data available in the PodcastRE collection. Specifically I will examine the structural affordances required due to how easy it is for a podcast author to modify an existing RSS feed and how the lack of a fixed set of agreed upon podcast RSS fields led to a wide net metadata capture approach for our database. Then, drawing on examples found while constructing the PodcastRE database, I will consider how the current RSS standard has constrained the questions that PodcastRE is able to answer. In particular how the lack of certain fields such as Network and Contributor stop PodcastRE from being able to answer questions which require the aggregation of related works. Finally, I will explore the current state of RSS and its related corporately controlled namespaces. This exploration will drive an argument about why for technical, metadata, and openness reasons it may be time for podcasts to move to a new open feed standard, such as JSON Feed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this chapter, I survey and appraise a range of sources that would alter the way future media historians interpret podcasting as a medium. Some of the examples are what archivists would label as "contextual metadata" or a medium's "significant properties" (see Marchioni et al. 2009 and Stepanyan et al. 2012). Others are more similar to the film and television paratexts that Jonathan Gray analyzes in his book Show Sold Separately (Gray 2010). All of them are collectible in some way. My goal is to move beyond merely a theoretical discussion and toward a pragmatic plan for PodcastRE's future development. Collectively, these sources provide a map to the norms of production and reception, as well as the intermediaries through which producers and listeners interact.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter investigates these questions by employing digital tools to de-naturalize the voices of podcasters located both inside and outside of the NPR ecosystem. By using the forced aligner Gentle and the pitch tracker Drift, we seek to explore how precisely these productions approach vocal delivery. How do podcasters attempt to wed scripted material with emotional cadence? What is it about this delivery that clearly differentiates it from other podcasts and from formal expectations that accompanied previous audio media like broadcast radio? And how can we empirically analyze these techniques and differences? Through digital tools that measure fine-grained aspects of vocal performances, we pinpoint clear differences between various genres of podcasting and intervene into the debates surrounding vocal delivery. First, we look at meditation and news podcasts to find a baseline for controlled vocal delivery. Next, we examine different NPR podcasts to attempt to delineate common strategies of vocal performance as seen through pitch and rhythm. Finally, we look at the ways more conversational and improvisational podcasts differed from these controlled and scripted models.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>By looking at an emotionally charged case study through the prismatic perspective of the PodcastRE database, I hope to examine what makes broadcasting unique in the modern age when so many individuals can add their voices to a public forum. I will use the Donald Sterling scandal as a flash point for podcasting discourse, noting how the conversation changes based on the distinction between professional and amateur productions and the subject matter of a podcast series. In the process, I hope to demonstrate hose these production contexts and economic imperatives can lead to discussions that either individualize the scandal or interrogate the systemic racial issues beneath it. Finally, I will outline how the database works as a tool to make this chaotic discourse legible as a case study. I believe that studying this discourse can provide a more nuanced understanding of how we as a society publicly address issues of race and the reasons we might shy away from these conversations or frame them as the aberrant actions of an individual rather than a product of systemic racism. Meanwhile, studying these concerns through the PodcastRE database does not just provide us with different perspectives and interpretations but also gives us their meaningful contrast. Ultimately, I hope to demonstrate how podcasting provides new opportunities for political discourse beyond the hegemony of traditional broadcasting, while observing how often these conversations can still defer to the corporate interests of the NBA.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Accordingly, this paper examines this shift toward "platformized" podcasts, referred to here as the "Spotification" of podcasting. It pays particular attention to the role open technologies like RSS and XML have played in creating a vibrant environment for audio. It investigates the logics Spotify and other similar platforms deploy for podcast display and discovery on its platform and argues that the Spotification of podcasting may represent a welcome push towards more user-friendly and mainstream consumption of podcasts but, in the process, might threaten the very format these companies hope to popularize. In other words, the Spotification of podcasting may make podcasts more ubiquitous than ever but this added visibility might undermine some of the format's earliest promises of accessibility and diversity of voices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines metadata as a site for uncovering contextual features that ground digital artifacts within a broad web of relations connecting creators, platforms, and audiences. Utilizing the PodcastRE metadata analytics applications, I argue that keywords are one critical area where podcasters negotiate and exert agency through self- identification apart from the dominant presence of the search engine algorithms within commercial podcatcher applications. They do this by establishing their own relational networks that foreground defining their publics, using keywords to signal to their audience their respective ideologies. Concurrently, I analyze the politics of podcatching applications as they continue to influence how podcasters apply keywords, resulting in the most common keywords reflecting pre-defined iTunes categories. While podcasts are often framed as an approachable audio practice amenable to amateurs due to lower barriers of entry, podcatcher applications act as cultural intermediaries between listener and content creator. They reify the growing hierarchical star systems that pertain to the podcasting ecosystem, leading to a palpable impact in the way podcasts and metadata are produced. By shifting the focus of analysis from the podcast to the periphery of its metadata, novel observations can be made about the contextual dimensions of podcasting culture. Within this framework, I conclude with an analysis of the strategies employed by podcasters of color as they engage in metadata activism in order to carve out spaces within these platforms to speak about their racialized experiences and engage in civic discourse.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using the case of the PodcastRE database, I argue that the development of new sonic methodologies is crucial for researchers to capitalize on the wealth of insight and information available in the booming audio culture emerging around podcasting. There are certainly advantages to the affordances provided by digital formats (i.e. metadata, automated collection, elaborate tools for the visualization of sound waves etc.) but I argue we still need to foreground sound itself in our methods and audio collections. Developing sonic methodologies in conjunction with more traditional/typical digital methodologies for sound and audio archives will expand the utility of sound databases and will also help alleviate the problems that accompany the primacy of the visual (Hilmes, 2005; Sterne, 2003) afforded to most archives. Approaching sound archives and objects sonically, instead of just visually or textually, offers new perspectives and paths for research, since, as Tara Rodgers notes, "vibrations – including that specific class of audible vibrations experienced as sound – present alternative ways of apprehending reality that can point to political sensibilities that emphasize complexity, interconnection and interdependence rather than modes of distancing and control" (Rodgers, 2018: 234). Placing sound at the forefront, not just of media artifacts we need to save, but as a method for analyzing that which we have saved, gives us a new mode for approaching archives and databases, as well as the sonic ephemera that lies within them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since the End of the Nineteenth Century Dalits struggled for the right to public spaces, including temples, streets, water tanks and schools. Like other battles, Dalits' quest for education was filled with contradictions, triumphs and reversals. What did education mean to Dalit men and especially women? Why was it so important to them? How did women deal with double patriarchy, private and public, inside and outside their homes, and double discrimination---of caste and gender oppression? This essay focuses on the life history of three Dalit middle-class women from Pune, Maharashtra.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nostalgia for the Soviet Jewry movement contains an implicit critique of Jewish educational models that prioritize shaping individual identity above engaging people in world-changing collective action. American Jews valorize the Soviet Jewry movement as a moment when Jews in great number creatively and passionately engaged the world as Jews in order to change the world in specific ways. This chapter draws out implications for  American Jewish educators today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter covers categories that have historically shaped authority, responsibility, and identity among Bantu-speaking communities in Africa's Bantu Matrilineal Belt from the precolonial to the contemporary era. The societies that contribute to this analysis were primarily matrilineal. In such societies, women were hardly excluded from positions of authority, but rather maintained considerable authority even where and when patrilineal models or even patriarchy crept into the social system. Through practices of heterarchy, familial relations, and lifestages, women welded authority equal to and often greater than men.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Is bhakti a language of power or of pro test?" This is a very provocative question. Bhakti informs a vast literature, but does it constitute a language? If we think of a language as a symbolic system oriented around expressing something, it does seem right to call bhakti a language. Bhakti forms a symbolic system for communicating the sentiment of devotion, and like other languages it has its own dictionary</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An unbroken tradition of protest song has survived for centuries off the coast of the states of Georgia and South Carolina. The carriers of this tradition are known as the Gullah.  The Gullah are descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to America for their rice-growing skills. For generations they have resided on the Sea Islands and Coastal Lowlands of South Carolina and Georgia. Given their geographic isolation, the Gullah have retained more of their African cultural heritage than any other group of African Americans (Opala 1986). On the islands, as in Africa, singing has long been a daily part of work and play, prayer and protest. The rhythmic drive of the drums, so prevalent in Africa, was transferred to body percussion to replace the banned instrument (Southern 1997). These performance practices accompanied two song styles: short musical phrases with variations in repetition; and call-and-response, in which one singer leads and is supported by a group (ibid, 14-15).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper uses the historiography of Syriac and Coptic Studies to reconsider and recast the origin story of rapidly rising field in the academy, namely the Digital Humanities. Origin stories about the Digital Humanities (or "humanities computing" as it was known in its early years) often begin with Fr. Roberto Busa, a theologian and Aquinas scholar who teamed up with IBM's Thomas J. Watson to produce the computing infrastructure behind the print publication of the Index Thomisticus. The Index Thomisticus can also be understood as an act of cultural heritage preservation and promotion; this early humanities computing was in the service of studying and eventually digitizing a pillar of the Western canon.  The paper advocates broadening our horizons for identifying "origin moments" or "origin points" in the field of Digital Humanities, particularly as DH intersects with religion, Christianity, and Christian canons.  Cultural heritage groups outside the Catholic and Protestant American mainstream conducted early digitization of Christian literary sources and scholarship. The work of Coptic Orthodox Christians and Syrian Christians to digitize Coptic and Syriac literature, promote open access scholarship, publish on digital platforms, and engage in "public humanities" (all central elements of what we now understand "digital humanities" to be) were, like Busa's Index Thomisticus, acts of cultural heritage preservation and acts of digital humanities pioneering.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article focuses on the history of recreational sites in the Taksim area of Istanbul, from their use in the late nineteenth century through their transformation over time. It argues for the importance of preserving historic recreation sites that carry significance for urban residents as spaces where individual and collective social histories have played out. The site that is now termed Taksim Square and Gezi Park has, and continues to be, a charged site of protest where power struggles have taken place between individuals, communities and municipal powers. Most recently, in 2013, this struggle revolved around preserving the square and the park as a public space. While it is important to preserve the park and square, it is also important to lend voice to the various histories that lie buried within this site. Turkey's dominant political leadership not only employs a neo-Ottoman aesthetic in the neo-liberal development plan for Turkey's major cities, but it is also resurrecting symbols that represent the late-Ottoman project of modernity. This study articulates a counter-narrative to a selective preservation of late-Ottoman history to ask if and how the people's gardens truly served the "public benefit" in the past, which publics they served, and how various communities exerted effort to acquire access to and visibility within these spaces.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To be "a real country", Frank Zappa wrote, "at the very least you need a beer."  In the context of Turkey, however, the place of beer has often been contested.  Since before the republic's 1923 establishment, Turkish national identity enjoyed a strong association with the equally strong anise-flavoured spirit raki.  Meanwhile, Islamic conservatives like President Erdogan point to non-alcoholic yogurt-based ayran as their alternative. While such debates attract a great deal of attention in discussion of the country's secular–religious divide, in practice, beer long rivalled – and often far surpassed – raki in its scales of production, profits, consumption, availability, and even politicisation. Though beer originated in Ancient times in the greater Fertile Crescent region, it was reintroduced to Anatolia as a European beverage linked with modern brewery production and the Bomonti brothers in the late Ottoman era. It survived the empire's fall and a short-lived prohibition of alcohol in the early 1920s to become a prized concern for Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's national republic, which consolidated its production under the state monopoly TEKEL. Profiting from its consumption, the state paradoxically promoted beer while it encouraged moderation. Following beer's history through subsequent developments brought about with rising neoliberalism and political Islam, beer became a major symbol of resistance in the 1913 Gezi Park protests and since amid ongoing Islamist and public health pressures to further regulate – or prohibit – alcohol in modern Turkey.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The volume discusses the world as it was known in the Medieval and Early Modern periods, focusing on projects concerned with mapping as a conceptual and artistic practice, with visual representations of space, and with destinations of real and fictive travel. Maps were often taken as straightforward, objective configurations. However, they expose deeply subjective frameworks with social, political, and economic significance. Travel narratives, whether illustrated or not, can address similar frameworks. Whereas travelled space is often adventurous, and speaking of hardship, strange encounters and danger, city portraits tell a tale of civilized life and civic pride. The book seeks to address the multiple ways in which maps and travel literature conceive of the world, communicate a 'Weltbild', depict space, and/or define knowledge. The volume challenges academic boundaries in the study of cartography by exploring the links between mapmaking and artistic practices. The contributions discuss individual mapmakers, authors of travelogues, mapmaking as an artistic practice, the relationship between travel literature and mapmaking, illustration in travel literature, and imagination in depictions of newly explored worlds.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Did American racism originate in the liberal North? An inquiry into the system of institutionalized racism created by Northern Jim Crow  Jim Crow was not a regional sickness, it was a national cancer. Even at the high point of twentieth century liberalism in the North, Jim Crow racism hid in plain sight. Perpetuated by colorblind arguments about "cultures of poverty," policies focused more on black criminality than black equality. Procedures that diverted resources in education, housing, and jobs away from poor black people turned ghettos and prisons into social pandemics. Americans in the North made this history. They tried to unmake it, too.  Liberalism, rather than lighting the way to vanquish the darkness of the Jim Crow North gave racism new and complex places to hide. The twelve original essays in this anthology unveil Jim Crow's many strange careers in the North. They accomplish two goals: first, they show how the Jim Crow North worked as a system to maintain social, economic, and political inequality in the nation's most liberal places; and second, they chronicle how activists worked to undo the legal, economic, and social inequities born of Northern Jim Crow policies, practices, and ideas.  The book ultimately dispels the myth that the South was the birthplace of American racism, and presents a compelling argument that American racism actually originated in the North.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The post-civil rights era of the 1970s offered African Americans an all-too-familiar paradox. Material and symbolic gains contended with setbacks fueled by resentment and reaction. African American artists responded with black approaches to expression that made history in their own time and continue to exercise an enormous influence on contemporary culture and politics. This collection's fascinating spectrum of topics begins with the literary and cinematic representations of slavery from the 1970s to the present. Other authors delve into visual culture from Blaxploitation to the art of Betye Saar to stage works like A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White as well as groundbreaking literary works like Corregidora and Captain Blackman. A pair of concluding essays concentrate on institutional change by looking at the Seventies surge of black publishing and by analyzing Ntozake Shange's for colored girls... in the context of current controversies surrounding sexual violence. Throughout, the writers reveal how Seventies black cultural production anchors important contemporary debates in black feminism and other issues while spurring the black imagination to thrive amidst abject social and political conditions.Contributors: Courtney Baker, Soyica Diggs Colbert, Madhu Dubey, Nadine Knight, Monica White Ndounou, Kinohi Nishikawa, Samantha Pinto, Jermaine Singleton, Terrion L.

		<Abstract>Victorian Jamaica explores the extraordinary surviving archive of visual representation and material objects to provide a comprehensive account of Jamaican society during Queen Victoria's reign over the British Empire, from 1837 to 1901. In their analyses of material ranging from photographs of plantation laborers and landscape paintings to cricket team photographs, furniture, and architecture, as well as a wide range of texts, the contributors trace the relationship between black Jamaicans and colonial institutions; contextualize race within ritual and performance; and outline how material and visual culture helped shape the complex politics of colonial society. By narrating Victorian history from a Caribbean perspective, this richly illustrated volume—featuring 270 full-color images—offers a complex and nuanced portrait of Jamaica that expands our understanding of the wider history of the British Empire and Atlantic world during this period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>3D modeling offers a powerful tool to explore and display the interaction of complex topography and innovative building history in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace. Whole-site reconstructions, however, force the issue of how best to acknowledge the partiality of evidence. This paper addresses the challenges of building virtual representation(s) that include specific buildings or structures that warrant reconstruction but present fundamental uncertainties. Because reconstructions can take on their own reality, strategies for effectively exploring structure, space, and environment while confronting, acknowledging, and communicating the extent of the evidence visually are essential. One approach is to offer choice through iterations that present diverse possibilities for a reconstruction, allowing the viewer to compare, toggle between, or interactively explore the options. But to what extent do multiple iterations confuse rather than clarify a reconstruction? What are the boundaries between archaeological documentation and visual evocation? These issues are raised in order to open discussion on the nature, purpose, and advantages of virtual architectural reconstruction within a non-generic environment. Three case studies centering on the Ionic Porch, the Nike Monument, and the bridges crossing the central ravine present different kinds of uncertainty that we have confronted while using 3D modeling as the emerging engine of architectural investigation in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The interstitium, a network of fluid-filled spaces forming a coherent organ of translocation within the body, maps well onto our investigations of the Hellenistic Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace. The cognate interstitium of spaces, pathways, and viewscapes within the sanctuary share a similar flexible and connective coherence. Through examining experiential aspects of passages leading from the entrance to the Central Sanctuary, across the seasonal torrent, and to the theatre and terrace in front of the Stoa, we argue that the interstitial network within the sanctuary emerges as a critical mediator of the reciprocal relationships between architecture, landscape, and human actors in the construction of sacred space.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The furniture-sculptures in this exhibition allow us to assess how Ai Weiwei's use of traditional craft techniques comments on what happens when society and culture engage the past and the present side by side. The relationship between the past and the present, especially the relative values that the present places on different aspects of the past, is always at stake in the reuse  and rediscovery of traditional approaches. By rejointing the traditional and the contemporary—both literally and figuratively—Ai Weiwei's         furniture-sculptures offer both a clear message supporting the continuation of traditions when creating contemporary art and a warning of what might happen when too much of the past is discarded.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay argues that, while the "new discoveries," the inventions of novelties, things, and machines are no doubt a central dimension of Stradanus' Nova Reperta print series, many of the prints instead, or, in addition, foreground the skilled work and creative potential of the human hand and the industry of artisans by which valuable goods and knowledge were produced.  Indeed, it could be argued that the series as a whole focuses less on discrete inventions and discoveries than on the processes and processual knowledge of ars—the work of the human hand—and its potential for transformation of the material and human worlds.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ecological Form brings together leading voices in nineteenth-century ecocriticism to suture the lingering divide between postcolonial and ecocritical approaches. Together, these essays show how Victorian thinkers used aesthetic form to engage problems of system, interconnection, and dispossession that remain our own. The authors reconsider Victorian literary structures in light of environmental catastrophe; coordinate "natural" questions with sociopolitical ones; and underscore the category of form as a means for generating environmental—and therefore political—knowledge. Moving from the elegy and the industrial novel to the utopian romance, the scientific treatise, and beyond, Ecological Form demonstrates how nineteenth-century thinkers conceptualized the circuits of extraction and violence linking Britain to its global network. Yet the book's most pressing argument is that this past thought can be a resource for reimagining the present.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) lies at the intersection of early modern and modern times. Frequently portrayed as the concluding chapter of the Reformation, it also points to the future by precipitating fundamental changes in the military, legal, political, religious, economic, and cultural arenas that came to mark a new, the modern era.  Prompted by the 400th anniversary of the outbreak of the war, the contributors reconsider the event itself and contextualize it within the broader history of the Reformation, military conflicts, peace initiatives, and negotiations of war.</Abstract>

Visual Representation of Sacred Mysteries in Early Modern Europe, 1400-1700. Whereas the latter volume focused on sacramental mysteries, the current one examines a wider range of secret subjects. The book examines how secret knowledge was represented visually in ways that both revealed and concealed the true nature of that knowledge, giving and yet impeding access to it. In the early modern period, the discursive and symbolical sites for the representation of secrets were closely related to epistemic changes that transformed conceptions of the transmissibility of knowledge.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The chapter focuses on the royal road of the interior that linked Central Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley to highlight the indigenous origins of its pathways and to showcase the economic and political agency exerted by native peoples. Native communities located on the royal road and its vicinity had unique access to commercial opportunities. Indigenous artisans traveled to and along the road to find a market for their products. Farmers similarly relied on a steady stream of travelers seeking food and shelter to buy their surplus corn and other products to make some gains. Indian guides found paying customers who required their services to find their way from one stop along the road to the next settlement. The historiography on royal roads in New Spain has primarily focused on their connection to the Spanish colonial economy. This chapter aims to shift the narrative by illustrating how a number of indigenous communities used the routes for their own purposes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume of essays focuses on how individuals living in the late tenth through fifteenth centuries engaged with the authorizing culture of the Anglo-Saxons. Drawing from a reservoir of undertreated early English documents and texts, each contributor shows how individual poets, ecclesiasts, legists, and institutions claimed Anglo-Saxon predecessors for rhetorical purposes in response to social, cultural, and linguistic change. Contributors trouble simple definitions of identity and period, exploring how medieval authors looked to earlier periods of history to define social identities and make claims for their present moment based on the political fiction of an imagined community of a single, distinct nation unified in identity by descent and religion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholarly analysis of the French japoniste movement relies largely on the memoirs, private journals, and letters left by male artists, intellectuals, and businessmen such as Gaston Migeon, Raymond Koechlin, Tadamasa Hayashi, and Henri Cernuschi, who represented the collecting of Japanese prints, as an exclusive set of activities that took place among a small group of men behind closed doors. Such retrospective accounts, while nostalgic, have, I argue, falsely represented the Japanese print collecting world of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by eliding the active role played by women collectors such as Florine Langweil, Louise-Marcelle Seure, Louise Curtis, and Mary A. Ainsworth, who also acquired and exchanged ukiyo-e prints. Analysis of archives from the Union Centrale des arts décoratifs, which acknowledge the participation of ten women in the six exhibits of Japanese prints held yearly from 1909-1914, serve as a basis for providing new models of female engagement with print collecting.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Throughout their histories, there has been a strong tendency within religious traditions to differentiate between true and false doctrine and praxis, and Muslim communities were no exception. As a result, Muslim authors from the earliest periods of their recorded history have regularly produced arguments aimed at either defining themselves as falling within the orbit of the Muslim community and therefore ‘acceptable', or defining others as ‘heterodox' or ‘heretical', thereby excluding them as outsiders to the community liable to persecution. These attempts at defining or policing the boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate thought and praxis were dramatically heightened by the modern intellectual  movement  of  the Enlightenment, which placed definition and taxonomy at the heart of an  attempt  to  create  a  universally  applicable  understanding  of the world and its peoples.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Planning with some prescribed graphic methods manifests the architect's vision in accordance with the authority of nature. Once realized on the plane of the drawing surface with the architect's tools and techniques of graphic construction, the surveyor's instruments and procedures project this vision into the final measurements of the monumental building on the plane of the earth. This chapter provides an overview of the Roman architectural process that largely determined form and experience before construction even began. A review of the details of these drawings is necessary to understand the general principles of scale planning, measurement, and commensuration in Greek and Roman architecture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cinecittà – the Fascist-built "Hollywood on the Tiber," one of the world's great movie studios, 9 km. southeast of Rome – played a key role in the affairs of the Italian state, the havoc of battle, and post-World War 2 reconstruction. In the context of my broader research project uncovering the studio's fantastic, often mind-spinning history in the 1940s, I focus in this essay on new findings relating to the establishing of a POW camp in Cinecittà's backlot in 1942. Its inmates, some 400 black South African prisoners, joined with several dozen black women and children shuffled from occupied France, were deployed as movie extras in both German and Italian propaganda fiction films – a practice that foreshadowed MGM's postwar use of refugees on these same grounds. Tracing the interplay between disparate historical and fictional mise-en-scènes – one penetrating or enveloping the other under the conditions of war, displacement, and confinement – the essay raises new questions of film culture and institutions in relation to state apparatuses, the reality of the studio and its spatial practices, and the world-making powers of cinema.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Private Lives, Public Histories brings together diverse methods from archaeology and cultural anthropology, enabling us to glean rare information on private lives from the historical record. The chapters span geographic areas to present recent ethnohistorical research that advances our knowledge of the connections between the public and private domains and the significance of these connections for understanding the past as a lived experience, both historically and in a contemporary sense. We discuss how the use of different sources—e.g., public records, personal journals, material culture, the built environment, letters, public performances, etc.—can reveal different types of information about past cultural contexts, as well as private sentiments about official culture and society. Through an exploration of sites as varied as homes, factories, plantations, markets, and tourism attractions we address the public significance of private sentiments, the resilience of bodies, and gendered interactions in historical contexts. In doing so, this book highlights linkages between private lives and public settings that have allowed people to continue to exist within, adapt to, and/or resist dominant cultural narratives.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This book is for teachers who want to heighten the intellectual impact of their courses by using their classrooms as a creative space for social formation and action. Its twenty-one chapters provide diverse perspectives on Shakespeare and early modern literature that engage innovation, collaboration, and forward-looking practices. They model ways of mobilizing justice with early modern texts and claim the intellectual benefits of integrating social justice into courses. The book reconceives the relationship between students and Renaissance literature in ways that enable them – and us – to move from classroom discussions to real-life applications.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Shakespeare | Sense explores the intersection of Shakespeare and sensory studies, asking what sensation can tell us about early modern drama and poetry, and, conversely, how Shakespeare explores the senses in his literary craft, his fictional worlds, and his stagecraft.  15 substantial new essays by leading Shakespeareans working in sensory studies and related disciplines interrogate every aspect of Shakespeare and sense, from the place of hearing, smell, sight, touch, and taste in early modern life, literature, and performance culture, through to the significance of sensation in 21st century engagements with Shakespeare on stage, screen and page.  The volume explores and develops current methods for studying Shakespeare and sensation, reflecting upon the opportunities and challenges created by this emergent and influential area of scholarly enquiry. Many chapters develop fresh readings of particular plays and poems, from Hamlet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, King Lear, and The Tempest to less-studied works such as The Comedy of Errors, Venus and Adonis, Troilus and Cressida, and Cymbeline.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter will build on recent insights into the social history of peasant-soldiers in the Mughal province of Punjab to examine why Punjab became a center for military entrepreneurship by the mid-eighteenth century. Although Sikhs and Afghans were the most visible and enduring of these new warrior groups in Punjab, the presence of other clusters suggests that relationships forged in rural revenue collection, access to kinship networks, and the vast demand for military talent throughout the Mughal period created a nexus of opportunities for military entrepreneurs in eighteenth-century Punjab. This chapter will show why factors such as the embrace of new martial skills or ideologies cannot explain by themselves, the efflorescence of warrior groups that emerged in eighteenth-century Punjab. The dramatic changes wrought on rural Punjabi society by an expanding economy in the seventeenth century, along with the emerging cross-caste and cross-regional alliances that nourished political collaborations between groups, fostered new forms of military entrepreneurship.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Current anthropological models for ancient states in Mongolia are relatively few in number.  At the same time, the very unique circumstances under which Mongolian states and empires formed (i.e., pastoral nomadic lifeways, high mobility, low population density, spatially extensive regions) make these early "nomadic states" extremely important case studies for anthropological archaeologists interested in the nature of statehood generally (Honeychurch 2014).  Traditionally, archaic states have been associated with intensive agriculture, sedentary lifeways, urbanism, political hierarchy, and administrative centralization but the concept of "the ancient state" has been changing as archaeologists explore diverse parts of the world with different lifeway traditions.  As a result, the range of early polities discussed as "ancient states" has grown to include substantial organizational variety.  This is clearly reflected in the names for what might be called alternative kinds of states such as city states, segmentary states, theater states, galactic polities, opportunistic states, etc. (e.g., Chapman 2003). Mongolian archaeology is perfectly situated to add substantially to this anthropological discussion over ancient states.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter argues that the First Sale Doctrine has been the legal bedrock for two key features of twentieth-century media distribution in the U.S.: the retail store and what is usually called the secondary (ie. used) market. In enabling these institutions, the Doctrine has provided consumers broader and cheaper access to media goods while also fostering new forms of entrepreneurial activity and participatory culture. Drawing from legal cases, congressional hearings, and trade articles, this chapter also demonstrates and accounts for the Doctrine's surprising resilience throughout the twentieth century, during which time it had been the object of numerous attempts by American media companies to undermine or dismantle it. The chapter concludes with an analysis of the Doctrine's continued meaning and validity during the twenty-first century, particularly with respect to new digital distribution systems and restrictive Terms of Service licenses.</Abstract>

This model of belief storage is attractive and widely assumed because it appears to provide an explanation of the flexibility of cognition and the complicated dynamics of belief revision. However, when one scrutinizes human cognition, one finds strong evidence against a unified web of belief and for a fragmented model of belief storage. This article then uses the best available evidence from cognitive science to develop this fragmented model into a nascent theory of the cognitive architecture of belief storage</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Previously we've argued that inferential transitions occur between thoughts based on rules that are built into the architecture of the mind that specify types of constituent structure (Quilty-Dunn &amp;amp; Mandelbaum 2018). Inference isn't everything, however, and may indeed account for a small part of our mental lives. In this article we intend to account for types of transitions that look to be inference-like but, according to our account, aren't genuine inferences. We'll also consider the structure of association in more detail, which sheds light not only on associative transitions but also on their rule-governed foils, both inferential and non-inferential. Providing an adequate, coherent theory of thinking requires that we give an account of all these transitions. We aim to undertake this project, thereby providing a short taxonomy of types of mental transitions here.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Anne Moody cemented her legacy as a major figure in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement in 1968 when she published her bestselling memoir, Coming of Age in Mississippi.  Soon after, she left the Movement and the United States.  Northern racism, black nationalism, and FBI surveillance eroded her hopes for equality, racial integration, and her own personal safety.  Like so many disillusioned black Americans before her, in 1969 Moody fled to France, hoping to find, if not opportunity, then at least respite.  Her years in Europe provided her with a global stage to speak about civil rights; as a U.S. citizen, her voice validated, in its very existence, even as it denied, in its specific substance, her nation's claims to lead the "free world."  By taking her stories of American racism to an international audience and recasting civil rights in terms of human rights, Moody developed a new identity and a new activist role.  She was not simply a disgruntled expatriate, but a global citizen who invited the world to scrutinize her home country.   In this capacity, she also exhorted her host countries to consider their own culpability in violations of human and civil rights, particularly as proponents of nationalism, specifically through sport.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter traces the development of early British abolitionist proceduralism in contestation against colonial slave laws by studying legal cases pursued by Granville Sharp and abolitionist lawyers between 1767 and 1774 involving fugitive slaves in England who had been recaptured by their enslavers, including the famous Ex parte Somerset decision of 1772. Pursuing charges of assault against the kidnappers, lawyers also frequently had recourse to the legal process of the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum et recipiendum, which enabled courts to adjudicate the legality of an individual's detention and to free those unlawfully detained. While historians of law and the British empire have frequently viewed the verdict in Somerset as, at best, confirming English law's ignorance of slavery, such emphasis on legal exceptionalism does not reveal the generalizing remedial capacities of the ruling in an imperial context. Drawing upon Paul D. Halliday's demonstration of the strong remedial and imperial jurisdiction of King's Bench in the eighteenth century, the chapter shows how the entitlement of the slave's vulnerable human body to protection by the common law emerged through abolitionist proceduralism, which framed habeas corpus as a representative legal action. These cases promulgated new definitions of collective ‘rights of humanity' that would not be restricted to slavery alone, but could apply to violated rights of all oppressed persons across the Empire. Concluding with an analysis of two contemporaneous cases where representative habeas corpus actions failed in respect to a deported slave and insolvent debtors, the chapter reveals that collective ‘rights of humanity' based in the natural rights of the individual to personal liberty and bodily integrity could only come into question indirectly in the legal arena when the habeas corpus procedure itself was functioning correctly within a powerful imperial jurisdiction.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What kind of cultural and political leverage can legal fictions or personifications exert when they appear in fictional narratives? Perhaps no form of legal personhood has played a greater role in political crises than the "corpus" summoned by the writ of habeas corpus. This chapter examines how the habeas corpus judicial process produces a particular sort of legal personification, the corpus, combining an individual human body with a form of legal personhood. Focusing on the famous Ex parte Somerset decision of 1772 in juxtaposition to William Godwin's novel Caleb Williams (1794), it shows that a remedial judicial process such as habeas corpus— - and its fictionalization by novelists— - provides a new vantage on the history of human rights, particularly in respect to the protection of dissidents, the enslaved, or the disenfranchised from private or governmental coercion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Today's digital libraries consist of much more than simple 2D images of manuscript pages or paintings. Advanced imaging techniques – 3D modeling, spectral photography, and volumetric x-ray, for example – can be applied to all types of cultural objects and can be combined to create complex digital representations comprising many disparate parts. In addition, emergent technologies like virtual unwrapping and artificial intelligence (AI) make it possible to create "born digital" versions of unseen features, such as text and brush strokes, that are "hidden" by damage and therefore lack verifiable analog counterparts. Thus, the need for transparent metadata that describes and depicts the set of algorithmic steps and file combinations used to create such complicated digital representations is crucial. At EduceLab, we create various types of complex digital objects, from virtually unwrapped manuscripts that rely on machine learning tools to create born-digital versions of unseen text, to 3D models that consist of 2D photos, multi- and hyperspectral images, drawings, and 3D meshes. In exploring ways to document the digital provenance chain for these complicated digital representations and then support the dissemination of the metadata in a clear, concise, and organized way, we settled on the use of the Metadata En-coding Transmission Standard (METS). This paper outlines our design to exploit the flexibility and comprehensiveness of METS, particularly its behaviorSec, to meet emerging digital provenance metadata needs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is a chapter of my book in progress, now titled Moving Memory, but previously titled (when awarded the Summer Grant): Holocaust Dances: Representations of the Holocaust in Contemporary Dance. The chapter (draft) is 80 pages. ABSTRACT: How has contemporary dance theater staged survivor testimony? How might such works embody trauma and the complexities of survival? How might these dances bridge the distance between past and present, history and art, survivors and their pasts and audiences in the present? This chapter focuses on three full-evening pieces that engage with the testimony of specific Jewish, female survivors: Joseph Mills and Ballet Austin's Light: The Holocaust and Humanity Project (2005), based on the life of Naomi Warren (1920–2016), a Polish Jew who survived Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ravensbruck, and Bergen-Belsen; Bill T. Jones and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company's Analogy: Dora/Tramontane (2015), set to the oral history he conducted with Dora Werzberg Amelan (1920–2020), a French Jew of Polish descent who survived the war working for the Jewish underground in French transit camps; and Szabo and The Symptom's Sea Lavender and the Euphoria of Being (2016), which provided Fahidi (b. 1925), a Hungarian-Jewish survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Allendorf (Buchenwald), with a platform to tell her own story. Each work had disparate goals, utilized their source materials differently, and are aesthetically and choreographically distinct.  However, all three are examples of what I term "testimony dance," dance performances that are based on the oral histories of survivors and utilize a variety of corporeal, visual, choreographic, sonic, and textual means to mobilize testimony, memory, and history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I wrote a chapter from my book in progress. This chapter focuses on three full-evening pieces that engage with the testimony of specific Jewish, female survivors: Joseph Mills and Ballet Austin's Light: The Holocaust and Humanity Project (2005), based on the life of Naomi Warren (1920–2016), a Polish Jew who survived Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ravensbruck, and Bergen-Belsen; Bill T. Jones and the Bill T.

Notably, none of these choreographers are Jewish, but staging testimony required each of them to delve deeply into their subjects' histories while thinking carefully about what they, their art, and their companies could do with and for these stories. Light/The Holocaust and Humanity Project, Analogy: Dora/Tramontane, and Sea Lavender and the Euphoria of Being are unique in their use of dance as a forum for responding to and conveying witness testimony, delving into the depths of each survivor's trauma, while at the same time, underscoring the complexities (hope, ambivalence, responsibility) that comes with continuing to live. Each work had disparate goals, utilized their source materials differently, and are aesthetically and choreographically distinct.  However, all three are examples of what I term testimony dance, dance performances that are based on the oral histories of survivors and utilize a variety of corporeal, visual, choreographic, sonic, and textual means to mobilize testimony, memory, and history.</Abstract>

Jews and the Mediterranean considers the historical potency and uniqueness of what happens when Sephardi, Mizrahi, and Ashkenazi Jews meet in the Mediterranean region. By focusing on the specificity of the Jewish experience, the essays gathered in this volume emphasize human agency and culture over the length of Mediterranean history. This collection draws attention to what made Jewish people distinctive and warns against facile notions of Mediterranean connectivity, diversity, fluidity, and hybridity, presenting a new assessment of the Jewish experience in the Mediterranean.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Routledge Companion to Italian Fascist Architecture investigates what has become of the architectural and urban projects of Italian fascism, how sites have been transformed or adapted and what constitutes the meaning of these buildings and cities today. The essays include a rich array of new arguments by both senior and early career scholars from Italy and beyond. They examine the reception of fascist architecture through studies of destruction and adaptation, debates over reuse, artistic interventions and even routine daily practices, which may slowly alter collective understandings of such places. Paolo Portoghesi sheds light on the subject from his internal perspective, while Harald Bodenschatz situates Italy among period totalitarian authorities and their symbols across Europe. Section editors frame, synthesize and moderate essays that explore fascism's afterlife; how the physical legacy of the regime has been altered and preserved and what it means now. This critical history of interpretations of fascist-era architecture and urban projects broadens our understanding of the relationships among politics, identity, memory and place.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A Moving Border: Alpine Cartographies of Climate Change builds upon the Italian Limes project by Studio Folder, which was devised in 2014 to survey the fluctuations of the boundary line across the Alps in real time. The book charts the effects of climate change on geopolitical understandings of border and the cartographic methods used to represent them. Locating the Italian condition alongside a longer political history of boundary making, the book brings together critical essays, visualizations, and unpublished documents from state archives. By examining the nexus of nationalism and cartography, A Moving Border details how borders are both material and imagined, and the ways global warming challenges Western conceptions of territory. Even more, it provides a blueprint for spatial intervention in a world where ecological processes are bound to dominate geopolitical affairs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume centres around a day in December 1974 in San Costantino Albanese, and the photographic and pictorial traces it left behind. The documents presented here – four photographs of Carlo Levi dining and socialising in the company of local politicians and members of the community, and of a mural by Levi painted that evening – are stored, respectively, in the private collection which is the result of Nicola Scaldaferri's research and on a wall in the former Pro Loco of San Costantino Albanese. San Costantino Albanese is a small town in a remote mountainous area of Basilicata called Val Sarmento. It was settled during the sixteenth century by a community of Albanian refugees known as Arbëreshë, as a result of the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans. The community, like that of its neighbour San Paolo Albanese, is part of the Italo-Albanian Byzantine Catholic church and an early-modern form of the Albanian language is spoken in both villages. It becomes clear, through the essays in this volume, that four photographs from a private collection and a mural can generate a multitude of reflections that go beyond the time, place and people depicted in them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This Handbook produces a stereoscopic view of Chaucer's works. Juxtaposing chapters by Middle English scholars with chapters by specialists in other fields – Latin and vernacular literature, philosophy, theology, and history of science – it offers a new perspective that uses the works of Chaucer to look out upon the wider world. Clusters of essays that place Chaucer's works in "the Mediterranean Frame" and "the European Frame" are bracketed by groupings on "Biography and Circumstances of Daily Life" and "The Chaucerian Afterlife," while a cluster on "Christian Doctrine and Religious Heterodoxy" foregrounds the role of confessional identities in the emergence of Middle English literary authority. The Handbook's scope addresses the claim of universality that is often implicit in the study of Chaucer's works. Chapters on anti-Judaism in the Canterbury Tales and on Hebrew literature reveal what has been suppressed or elided in the construction of English literary history, while studying the Arabic sources and analogues of the frame tale tradition reveals the patterns of circulation that lie behind the early modern emergence of national literatures. Chapters on French, Italian, and Latin literature address the linguistic context of late fourteenth-century Europe, while chapters on philosophy, history of science, and theology spur on new areas of development within Chaucer studies. Pushing at the disciplinary boundaries of Chaucer Studies, this Handbook maps out how we might develop our field with greater awareness of the interconnected world of the fourteenth century, and the increasingly interconnected – and divided – world we inhabit today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The numerous rescue excavations conducted in Athens and Attica by the Archaeological Service during and after the major construction projects of the 2004 Olympic Games brought to light significant new prehistoric finds which have transformed our understanding of the region in prehistory. However, despite their importance, the new discoveries had remained mostly unnoticed by the international community, as the results were scattered in various publications, and no synthesis was ever attempted. The goal of the 2015 international conference Athens and Attica in Prehistory, which was organized by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, the University of Athens (Department of Archaeology and History of Art), the Museum of Cycladic Art and the Ephorate of Antiquites of East Attica (Hellenic Ministry of Culture) was to gather scholars working in the region and present for the first time a survey of Attic prehistory which would include the most recent discoveries and integrate over a century of scholarship. The 668- page conference proceedings include over 66 papers in Greek and English with sections dedicated to topography, the palaeo-environment, the Neolithic, the Chalcolithic transition, the Early Bronze Age, the Middle and Late Bronze Age, as well as the contacts between Attica and its neighbouring regions. A series of new detailed maps, derived from an exhaustive GIS-related database, provide the most up to date topographical and archaeological survey of Prehistoric Attica. Athens and Attica in Prehistory provides the most complete overview of the region from the Neolithic to the end of the Late Bronze Age. Its importance goes beyond the field of Aegean prehistory, as it paves the way for a new understanding of Attica in the Early Iron Age and indirectly throws new light on the origins of what will later become the polis of the Athenians.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The origins of satyr drama, and particularly the reliability of the account in Aristotle, remains contested, and several of this volume's contributions try to make sense of the early relationship of satyr drama to dithyramb and attempt to place satyr drama in the pre-Classical performance space and traditions. What is not contested is the relationship of satyr drama to tragedy as a required cap to the Attic trilogy. Here, however, how Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides (to whom one complete play and the preponderance of the surviving fragments belong) envisioned the relationship of satyr drama to tragedy in plot, structure, setting, stage action and language is a complex subject tackled by several contributors. The playful satyr chorus and the drunken senility of Silenos have always suggested some links to comedy and later to Atellan farce and phlyax. Those links are best examined through language, passages in later Greek and Roman writers, and in art. The purpose of this volume is probe as many themes and connections of satyr drama with other literary genres, as well as other art forms, putting satyr drama on stage from the sixth century BC through the second century AD. The editors and contributors suggest solutions to some of the controversies, but the volume shows as much that the field of study is vibrant and deserves fuller attention.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This volume brings together a broad range of scholarship on various aspects of multilingualism in South India and Sri Lanka, particularly with respect to written sources from the pre-modern world. Although the rich linguistic diversity of both regions has long been acknowledged, the consequences of this variety on linguistic and literary developments has rarely been explored, and never with the breadth that is offered here. Our contributions examine the nature and discursive functions of multilingualism, largely from the perspective of philology, in a diverse array of literary, linguistic, and cultural contexts. Some of the contributors bring their particular expertise to bear on the mutual influence of the Sanskrit and Tamil worlds, while others examine the complex linguistic, religious, and cultural negotiations evident in the literary products of authors writing in Arabic, Pali, Sinhala, Telugu, and Malayalam. Many of them also cite and translate paradigmatic examples. This volume is an important compendium of current research on multilingualism in South India and Sri Lanka and offers avenues for understanding the materials and the communities discussed herein in the context of larger conversations about multilingualism in the pre-modern world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In exploring the gendered nature of early modern imperialism in the Atlantic world, in this chapter, the authors construct their analysis across empires and imperial boundaries. It is impossible to understand early modern Atlantic empires without considering the role of gender in the imposition of imperial control, the adaptation and acquiescence of the people of the early modern Atlantic to that control, and the resistance to European attempts to alter their lives and gender expectations. Women's prosperity benefited everyone and their engagement with the Atlantic economy proved to be a successful adaptation to European imperialism. Around the Atlantic world, women resisted European imperial attempts to take their land, minimize their authority, enslave them, and control their minds and bodies. That resistance was sometimes violent, but more often came by ignoring legal and religious prescriptions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter explores the media–archaeological foundations of trompe l'oeil painting in antiquity, specifically the famous contest between the Greek painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius as recounted by Pliny the Elder. The anecdote is well known: whereas Zeuxis had painted a picture of grapes that deceived the birds who flew up to peck at them, Parrhasius won the palm for deceiving his rival with a painting of a curtain that compelled Zeuxis to ask that it be raised and the picture shown for his appraisal. Modern accounts and even depictions of the contest have taken for granted the formal realism of this painting, its extreme illusionism, as the catalyst of its deceptive power. By contrast, this chapter examines Parrhasius' curtain from a media–theoretical perspective, which considers the order of representation in relation to the experience of beholders in real space. In short, it argues that the success of Parrhasius' picture had less to do with its technical virtuosity than its shrewd understanding of how to produce the conditions for depictive and bodily co-presence.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Long viewed as a tabula rasa, the deserts of the American West have played a distinct role in the projection of American cultural identities. Historically represented through fantasies of individualism, frontier ruggedness, and land acquisition, the desert is also the site of extreme social and environmental violence. The Invention of the American Desert brings together a wide-ranging group of interdisciplinary essays that explore, through diverse perspectives, dialectical problems posed by an environment that has served as a testing ground for modernist experimentation, military-industrial incursions, and ecological disasters throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In light of the urgent climate crisis and the planet's increasing desertification, this volume reflects on the nature and legacy of the desert as a crucible for competing visions of land, environment, and art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>International in scope, this volume brings together leading and emerging voices working at the intersection of contemporary art, visual culture, activism, and climate change, and addresses key questions, such as: why and how do art and visual culture, and their ethics and values, matter with regard to a world increasingly shaped by climate breakdown?  Foregrounding a decolonial and climate-justice-based approach, this book joins efforts within the environmental humanities in seeking to widen considerations of climate change as it intersects with social, political, and cultural realms. It simultaneously expands the nascent branches of ecocritical art history and visual culture, and builds toward the advancement of a robust and critical interdisciplinarity appropriate to the complex entanglements of climate change.  This book will be of special interest to scholars and practitioners of contemporary art and visual culture, environmental studies, cultural geography, and political ecology.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the years, scholars in the humanities disciplines and scholars in economics have said little to each other about the point of graduating from university or about how to pay for it.  This is not surprising. The lack of scholarly communication across these particular disciplinary lines extends to many other areas of public policy.  Economists' general preference for parsimonious explanations of human behavior, and for axiomatic answers to normative questions are about as far removed as one can get from the interest of humanities scholars in individual variety and psychological depth, and from humanities scholars' insistence on historically and culturally contextualized approaches to the normative. This paper bridges the gap, describes the lineages of both humanistic and economic understandings of the value of college, and identifies major overlaps around the non-pecuniary and public benefits of a college degree</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The central role of the architecture for structuring cultural patterns and behaviors is well known for complex sedentary societies. In contrast, hunter-gatherer's relationship to the built environment, particularly mobile hunter-gatherers, is not often discussed in anthropological or archaeological literature (although see Cuenca-Solana, et al. 2018 and references therein; Maher and Conkey 2019; Milner, et al. 2018; Zubrow, et al. 2010). In contrast to the houses of sedentary peoples, hunter-gatherer houses are often described as ephemeral utilitarian shelters without further investigation into their cultural importance. The papers in this volume seek to reframe the conversation around hunter-gatherer houses through exploration of the diversity of hunter-gatherers' interaction with the built environment. The papers span broad temporal and cross-cultural ranges to understanding hunter-gatherer houses, exploring the use of architecture across time and space. Through these collected ideas, we hope that readers gain a new understanding of the importance of both ephemeral and persisting architecture for hunter-gatherer communities and cultures. Creating a sense of home is not limited to sedentary communities who construct permanent houses; mobile peoples also have meaningful relationships with architecture and use the built environment to help structure their world view.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The built environment delineates space for daily actions and important moments. Separating the occupants from the external world, walls can create barriers between the outside or can build communities within them. In archaeological literature, the term ‘house' often describes the architecture of settled peoples, painting visual images of sturdy stone structures dotting the landscape in perpetuity. In part, this image is constructed as the result of archaeological preservation; stone houses have longevity, with foundations and walls standing for thousands of years. In contrast, ephemeral and organic structures such as tents and brush huts are rarely preserved, and thus escape our conceptions of house and home in the past (Maher and Conkey, 2019). Issues of visibility are also intertwined with site function; what is visible archaeologically may be activity areas that do not relate to the domicile, which may be at a different location, and thus not identified in the archaeological record (Briz i Godino et al., 2013, Zubrow et al., 2010). This has led to a bias where mobile peoples are often forgotten in discussions of household archaeology, with a primacy placed on people who build permanent architecture. However, despite our modern biases, hunter-gatherers did (and do) have structures. Furthermore, as recently argued by Maher and Conkey (2019), these structures can convey a sense of ‘home', a concept usually reserved for sedentary people. Homes are where ‘life happens', where people interact with each other and with the objects in their lives. Not only are homes loci for ‘life', they themselves also live, undergoing changes, evolving with the inhabitants, and transitioning through rites of passage (Tringham, 1995). Recent excavations of two structures at Kharaneh IV, an Epipalaeolithic site in Eastern Jordan, provides a window into the lifeways of a hunter-gatherer community by reconstructing the life-history of the structures. These structures are ephemeral brush hut</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Diversity in the architecture of sedentary and complex societies is well-studied, but an emphasis on the role of mobility in hunter-gatherer adaptation has resulted in a lack of discussion of the built environment among these communities. Here we take a temporally broad and cross-cultural approach to document variability in archaeologically known hunter-gatherer architecture, focusing on diversity in form and function and the relationship between variability in architectural elements and environmental conditions, subsistence strategies, and social organization.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between 23 and 11.5 ka Epipaleolithic groups of Southwest Asia initiated and experienced dramatic changes —on a previously unprecedented scale—in economy and settlement, with the appearance of semi-sedentary villages and intensified interdependent relationships with each other and specific plants and animals. These events provide a rare opportunity to study the long-term development of social processes in the region and the increasingly obvious fact that social, economic and technological changes were manifested as complex, entangled and non-linear developments. Most recent attempts to explain change in the material culture record typically highlight the earliest evidence for plant management or cultivation, ritual funerary practices, and dwelling and architecture. While these are important contributions that serve as the foundation for challenging our traditional notions of hunter-gatherer to farmer transitions, they center on changes in the economic or symbolic realms of prehistoric life, arguably downplaying the role of technology. This paper attempts to explore the role of technology in our reconstructions of the lifeways of hunter-gatherers by examining the social role of technology, the centrality of the technological process to everyday practice, and the transmission of technological knowledge (and, thus, culture) through communities of practice. We use chipped stone tools and their associated debris from the site of Kharaneh IV, eastern Jordan, as an illustrative case study of how we currently study chipped stone tools in this region. Using a chaîne opératoire approach to the study of EP assemblages, we consider how different groups of knappers at the EP site of Kharaneh IV, and beyond, interacted in fluid and ever-changing interactions to share knowledge or reinforce existing social traditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ancient Athens is cited as the contentious caldron from which the western political tradition emerged. During the formative Archaic period (ca. 700-480 BC), Athenian history was marked by major socio-political and religious changes, including the first governmental institutions, formal laws, citizenship formalization, evidence for chattel slavery, social stratification (e.g., classes), and conflict among the aristocratic families, ultimately leading to the rise of democracy. To date, such processes are known to us through texts, artistic representations, and elite-centered mortuary grounds. This project focuses upon the extensive necropolis excavated at the ancient Attic port of Phaleron (ca. 8th-5th centuries BC) by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Western Attica, Piraeus, and the Islands. The size, date, state-of-the-art excavation techniques, preservation, and mortuary variation of the cemetery including apparent diverse non-elite individuals, some shackled and in mass graves, offer us a previously undocumented view of the ancient Athenian past. The collaborative Phaleron Bioarchaeological Project integrates multiple lines of evidence including biological, mortuary, and ceramic data, historic records, and archaeological science to elucidate the ancient lives of the commoners that remain largely unexplored or silenced. Here we present preliminary bioarchaeological results focusing upon individuals interred in cist graves and larnaces. We here discuss biological data within their archaeological contexts in a first attempt to piece together the life histories of the Phaleron people. Overall, this project exemplifies the need to integrate biological data, material culture, historical narrative, and scientific methods by offering a synthesized approach to reconstruct life and death in Archaic Athens.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The island of Samothrace is the result of continuous tectonic activity in the Northern Aegean region and more specifically the Great Anatolian Fault that shears its southeastern margin.  This high energy environment formed a variety of rocks, many of which were used in the construction of the buildings in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. Establishing a system of classification has help clarify local building history.  Petrographic analysis correlates specific building sites with at least three island quarries.  The choice of construction stone was based on physical attributes and engineering properties. Limestones and dolomites with open cavities (vugs) were light weight yet strong and thus well suited for foundations, while basalt, trachyte, and rhyolite were mainly limited to the lowest level of foundations or large-scale polygonal retaining walls. The carbonates show varying degrees of post-installation weathering and degradation, most notably in the increased volume of cavities created by the plucking out of various sized pebbles. In a sanctuary famed for its innovative architecture built of imported marble, our current investigation emphasizes the fundamental role of local stone as a major component in the process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The cultural heritage of medieval Sicily is extraordinary. Yet, although rich and diverse, it confronts numerous challenges that make it vulnerable and often inaccessible. Many of its medieval sites are unsigned. Others are very difficult to get to. And even others – ones that are more easily located – have erratic hours, essentially locking out the average visitor unless they are willing to invest the time and have the language skills necessary to persuade residents in the surrounding area to arrange access.   Inspired by these challenges, we are developing The Norman Sicily Project (NSP, http://normansicily.org) to document the cultural heritage of medieval Sicily during its Norman period (c. 1061-1194) so that a wider audience can learn about what was once there and what still remains. The site attempts to reconstruct what we know about the society by bringing together images, basic identifying information, geolocation data and, in some cases, videos, using modern web development techniques. For some sites, it also offers visualization tools that can help visitors understand the data in new ways. A genealogical resource - a force-directed graph - has also been developed to help viewers understand the kinship networks that the Norman rulers enjoyed with families across Europe. Blog posts by students working on the project as well as an online form that invites a broader community to participate in the project by submitting information that can be corroborated by the team's members have been developed to help foster a sense of community as well as to facilitate sharing by people who have relevant data, including Sicilians who have information stored locally in their cities and towns. The intention is that the project will offer scholars, students and the general public who are interested in Norman Sicily the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with each other while suggesting a web-based model for other medieval communities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What does an understanding of Jewish history contribute to the study of the Mediterranean, and what can Mediterranean studies contribute to our knowledge of Jewish history? Jews and the Mediterranean considers the historical potency and uniqueness of what happens when Sephardi, Mizrahi, and Ashkenazi Jews meet in the Mediterranean region. By focusing on the specificity of the Jewish experience, the essays gathered in this volume emphasize human agency and culture over the length of Mediterranean history. This collection draws attention to what made Jewish people distinctive and warns against facile notions of Mediterranean connectivity, diversity, fluidity, and hybridity, presenting a new assessment of the Jewish experience in the Mediterranean.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When we consider the place of epic heroines in literary adaptations of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana over the past 150 years, we immediately notice some striking patterns. Women in these works are often tasked with serving as signs of "Indian womanhood," "tradition," or "Hindu culture" and as such, are brought to bear in socio-political discourses in the public sphere. What complicates this is that public consensus about what these terms (even in the Mahabharata itself) constitute has shifted over time.</Abstract>

Although  the  scripts  of  satyr  drama  of  the  late  Hellenistic  and  Roman  era  do  not  survive,  even  in  fragments,  there  is  material  evidence  for  the  genre,  for  which  the  most  crucial  source  is  epigraphical.  Evidence for satyr drama performances is gathered and analyzed in the article.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The commonplace notion that in the seventeenth century the Ottoman timar was past its prime and a dying institution has meant that it has for the most part been neglected in Ottomanist historiography. This is despite the survival of a massive and uncharted archival source base that belies the has-been status of the institution. This contribution provides a survey of main document types by which the timar system was administered in the post-classical age, and demonstrates the need for extensive study of the various defter types, in particular the ruznamçe and yoklama registers. Further neglect of the seventeenth-century timar – which occupied a significant though as yet unsurveyed place in Ottoman state and society – means the perpetuation of a large gap in early modern Ottoman history. Also addressed are the prospects and problems of narrowing this gap.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Lowland South America's striking linguistic diversity presents a major puzzle to scholars of language and human prehistory. This chapter proposes that sociocultural practices provide important clues to a solution, and that linguistic differentiation across Amazonian groups is not so much a factor of isolation, but rather of interaction. Evidence includes the recurrence of regional ‘systems' across the Amazon basin, characterized by similarly essentializing views linking language and identity, and accompanied by restrained lexical borrowing and code-switching on the one hand, but convergence in grammar and discourse on the other. These phenomena may be grounded in the widespread view that social identity depends on the active maintenance of contrasts, including those relating to language.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter investigates the relationship between morphological complexity and language contact and change across western Amazonia. We explore morphological proliferation in particular domains (nominal classification, tense, evidentiality, and valence-adjusting), and follow this with a more systematic exploration of morphological complexity in relation to wordhood status across a sample of eleven Amazonian languages. We argue that a large percentage of bound morphemes in these languages display ambiguity between morphotactic versus syntactic analyses, suggesting that morphological autonomy is best characterized as a matter of degree, and that different degrees of autonomy may apply on a regional scale. Since many accounts of word-internal morphological complexity implicitly rely on notions of autonomy, Amazonian languages invite a revision of our current conception of this domain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ancient and medieval India (prior to ca. 1600) produced a vast literature dealing with the nature of the human being, the proper ordering of society, and ethical and legal norms. Sanskrit sources tend to emphasize special dignities belonging tof particular statuses according to a divinely ordained class hierarchy (var?a-dharma), but in some contexts we hear of universally shared aspects of the human condition. Ascetic and devotional movements found ways to call into question special dignities tied to ascriptive rank. Sanskrit texts on good governance and legal process formulate general standards of justice and equity that could cut across or by-passed rank. Thus, Hindu sources illustrate how ethical and legal orders find ways to compartmentalize: to recognize that all people can share basic capacities and aspirations does not automatically sweep the field clear of status dignity. This essay draws on Jeremy Waldron's concept of human dignity as a status claim that "levels up" by attributing to all people a dignity once reserved for a privileged few. We note Hindu examples of a similar approach, as well as examples of "leveling down" by pointing out the hypocrisy of elites while extolling the virtues of which the lowly are capable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines this burgeoning of Sanskrit as a medium for authoritative expression during the Classical Age, noting its use not just for sacred and legal texts but also for conveying expertise in political, legal, and various scholastic subjects, and in refined literary expression.  It further proposes to account for the success of such authority-claims through an analysis of the social role of ritualized practices surrounding the production and use of Sanskrit texts, and the institutions developed to promote the authority of the Brahmin communities that produced and disseminated them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A group of STEM education initiatives at SUNY Binghamton shares ISOTYPE Institute's mission to democratize knowledge. These projects are also inspired by the ISOTYPE method of pictorial storytelling. In this chapter, the authors will touch on three main points. They will discuss how Marie Neurath's science storytelling inspired Materials Matter App components. This will be followed by a section discussing the NEH awarded Materials Matter course, a course that bridges material culture with materials science. Authors will talk about the course's pedagogical framework, and discuss how this pedagogy is applied in the classroom, has inspired curatorial work, and is mirrored by the web-based tool, the Materials Matter App. The final segment will focus on how design work done for the Materials Matter App inspired the STEM Toolbox App. Synergy between the two Apps enabled a more encompassing toolbox, one that is capable of describing different material classes, for example, archaeological artifacts and energy materials. The chapter will conclude with a discussion of what Materials Matter and STEM Toolbox mean for the future of ISOTYPE pedagogy; and why ISOTYPE matters today as a living philosophy, and not merely as a topic of design-historical interest.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines how Latin American dependency theory became a global counter–Cold War social science. To do so, it focuses on a transnational network of economists and sociologists, diplomats and policymakers, whose nexus was the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL in Spanish and Portuguese). By shaping the theory and practice of economic development in the region, the economists in this network, referred to as cepalinos, became the fundamental point of reference for the generation of social scientists who came of intellectual age in the global 1960s and whose work gave rise to the concept of dependency. As "dependency theory" circulated across the region and flowed from South to North, it became the counterpart to the Cold War-imbued modernization theory.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Although thermal medicine originated as a result of ancient beliefs in the ability of water to transmit supernatural gifts from the divinity to humanity, by the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. the practice was already becoming both secularized and medicalized thanks to the rise of humoral medicine, which maintained that disease originated from imbalances in bodily fluids that mineral springs were uniquely positioned to restore.  Renaissance physicians took the humoral approach even further by studying the mineral properties of individual springs and prescribing treatments that targeted specific, individual conditions.  But despite the efforts of the early modern medical community to convince its patients that balneology was an empirical science, the uneven results of their prescriptions led many people to question the material simplicity of thermal cures.  If two people were affected with the same illness and followed the same external regimens, why was one person cured, while the other was not?  Did the person's state of mind play a role in the cure?  This paper will examine how beliefs about the power mind over matter evolved over the course of the 17th century through a comparison of the positions of Michel de Montaigne, René Descartes and Jean Racine on the curative mechanics of mineral springs.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this chapter I review the various meanings, practices, and theoretical investments of the term "tenko" across Japan's transwar history.  The term is best known through its interwar usage to signify the "ideological conversion" of hundreds of political activists and intellectuals, beginning with incarcerated Japanese Communist Party (JCP) members who publicly defected from the party in 1933-1934. It was then expanded later in the decade to encompass the experiences of leftist thinkers, academics as well as anti-colonial nationalists in colonial Korea who either abandoned political activism or began to proactively support the imperial state. Then, in the early postwar period, Japanese scholars returned to the question of tenko in order to pursue a variety of problems related to primarily Japanese intellectual history, including: theories of modern subjectivity, the paradigmatic shifts in modern Japanese intellectual history, the politics of writing, or, as revealing the constitutive dynamics of Japanese modernity or modernity more generally. I consider how we might construct a conceptual history of tenko that can account for all the diverse practices, political positions and theoretical investments the term accrued across the twentieth century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>It is unsurprising that the exploration of Argentina's willingness to absorb the perpetrators of unthinkable crimes, together with the tension between that nation as a haven for Jewish survivors and as a hiding place for their tormentors, is an important feature of post-Holocaust literature in Argentina.  Edgardo Cozarinsky's 2009 novel, Lejos de dónde (Far From Where?), approaches this thematic by imagining the life of a German woman who evades arrest when Auschwitz is liberated and, passing as a Jew, makes her way to Argentina, and of her son, who never learns his mother's history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter addresses the phenomenon I am calling "incidental Jewishness" in the content and reception of Nueve Reinas and El aura, the two feature films Fabián Bielinsky made before his death. Bielinsky's work as an assistant director included Cohen vs Rosi, a film with overtly Jewish content; but neither Nueve Reinas nor El aura has been received as a "Jewish film."  After discussing the vexed notion of identity itself (what might we mean when say that a cultural product is "Jewish"?), I discuss how the meanings circulating around the linked signifiers "Jew"/"Jewish"/"Judaism"/"Jewishness" in the context of contemporary Argentina emerge in and from Bielinsky's two feature films.  I pay special attention to what I think of as the Jewish moment in Nueve reinas, in which one of the con men identifies an elderly woman as Jewish and uses that knowledge to win her trust. I argue that this scene is highly suggestive of the ways that Jewishness permeates Argentina on the one hand and remains inassimilable on the other.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Stanley Lombardo's new verse translation of the most famous free-standing sequence from the great Indian epic The Mahabharata hews closely to the meaning, verse structure, and performative quality of the original and is invigorated by its judicious incorporation of key Sanskrit terms in transliteration, for which a glossary is also provided.  The translation is accompanied by Richard H. Davis' brilliant Introduction and Afterword. The latter, "Krishna on Modern Fields of Battle," offers a fascinating look at the illuminating role the poem has played in the lives and struggles of a few of the most accomplished figures in recent world history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The regulation of labor relations and social rights substantially changed workers' lives over the course of the 20th century. Domestic service, however, was only poorly and belatedly protected under labor law, and its incorporation proceeded in a slow, ambiguous, and nonlinear manner. The specific ways in which domestic service regulation emerged in Chile and Argentina, respectively, offer insight into this process and also present some important contrasts, despite the nations' geographic proximity. In Chile, although the rights recognized for household workers were limited, the Labor Code of 1931 included an article on domestic service. In Argentina, the first comprehensive regulation for this sector was a special statute sanctioned by decree in 1956. In both cases, the "special" nature of such regulation was attributed to the place of domestic service in family life. As domestic labor was reconceptualized through legislative reform in each country, household workers gradually came to enjoy some, but not all, of the rights guaranteed to other workers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>What follows is about Husserl, whose phenomenology, I believe, can be understood as a form of constructivism. However, I generally write about Husserl's philosophy of logic and mathematics, which he repeatedly said had nothing to do with transcendental phenomenology. So, my aim here is to discuss some things that I believe people interested in constructivism and Husserl's transcendental phenomenology need to keep in mind. I say that, despite appearances, phenomenology was not everything for Husserl. As much as he loved it, he placed definite limits on what one should do with it and believed that it required an objective complement in the form of pure logic, that it had to be subject to a priori laws to keep phenomenologists from falling into psychologism, naturalism, empiricism, relativism and associated evils. According to this interpretation, Husserl the possible constructivist, Husserl the phenomenologist, Husserl the Platonist, Husserl the realist, Husserl the idealist were one and the same person from the late 1890s until his death, something which is particularly well expressed in the volumes of his lecture courses published since the 1980s, which shed considerable light on his thought.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines how art and architecture actively manipulated how ancient Romans remembered and knew their world, sometimes even creating false memories of places, events, and institutions. It focuses on three case studies of objects and monuments from the Roman Empire: a sports souvenir from Roman Britain, travel souvenirs from the Bay of Naples, and the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome. Drawing on cognitive research into how external stimuli, including visual images, distort and falsify memories, the chapter demonstrates how these portable, private objects and monumental, public architecture all generated semantic memory of sites and activities around the Roman Empire. They may even have caused some Romans—and modern historians—to misremember certain historical events, such as the putative triumph in 202 CE of the emperor Septimius Severus. Cognitive theories such as the misinformation effect, the source monitoring framework, and the impact of conversation and collaboration on remembering illuminate how these objects and monuments—with their combinations of image and narrative—could shape semantic memories and create distorted and false memories through repeated viewing and use. Ultimately, the chapter argues that the souvenirs and triumphal arch projected manipulated semantic memories and false memories as a form of cultural and social connectivity, that is, a means of creating a shared cultural or historical narrative that could transcend time and space in the Roman Empire.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter considers four silver beakers manufactured in Gades (modern Cádiz, Spain) and ultimately deposited in the sacred springs of Aquae Apollinares (modern Vicarello, Italy). Crafted in the shape of milestones and inscribed with itineraries representing a land route from Gades to Rome, the beakers evoke travel along the network of Roman roads connecting Spain and Italy. Although often considered as souvenirs of Gades, this chapter argues that the milestone beakers shaped people's future thinking about travel, time, and space, at scales ranging from the granular and personal to the broader and imperial. Examining the milestone beakers through the intertwined lenses of future-oriented mental time travel and embodied cognition illuminates aspects of these remarkable vessels that we otherwise tend to overlook in favor of their impact on retrospective remembering.</Abstract>

The British captured native-born British subjects and colonial subjects, particularly in Canada, as well as newly independent American citizens. At the same time, Americans captured British sailors and other loyal subjects and forced them into service while also impressing fellow Americans.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Jeffersonians pursued a concerted program of "de-Anglicization" after twelve years of Federalist rule under the Washington and Adams administrations. As a project, de-Anglicization was committed to reversing trends in American state building patterned after the British fiscal-military state, particularly a government dependent on ever increasing tax revenue and debt financing to fund continuous war. The Jeffersonian attack on a permanent naval establishment was emblematic of their larger ideological views on the proper role of government.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the eyes of many medieval Christians, history repeated itself in 1099.  In June of that year, a fraction of the original armies of the First Crusade conquered Jerusalem and massacred the majority of its inhabitants.  The city's bloody conquest quickly came to stand for the entire First Crusade in medieval historiography; eyewitness narrators of the conquest creatively redeployed and combined scriptural passages as a way of endowing this momentous event with meaning, and later chroniclers continued this hermeneutical endeavor, mining the crusader capture of Jerusalem as they would a sacred text which might be interpreted along historical, moral, typological, and mystical lines.  On the typological level, the conquest of 1099 seemed to have been predicted by types in the Old and New Testaments, including the parting of the Red Sea and the dispersal of Christ's followers from Jerusalem, analogies which reflected widespread views of the crusaders as new Israelites or new apostles.  But the most insistent typological interpretation linked the 1099 conquest with the so-called ‘cleansing of the Temple,' when Christ drove the merchants and money-changers from the Temple in Jerusalem and afterward worked miracles of healing in the Temple precincts.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In place of a model that considers print and digital publishing as inherently separate processes, and that places digital publishing as the inevitable evolutionary endpoint of the codex form, we propose—building on work done by the Manifold team—"hybrid publishing" as a model that involves concurrent print and digital editorial and publication processes. In fact, we will show that in important respects, hybrid publishing can help us reimagine the relations between print and digital publishing by aligning pre-production processes that reduce the extent to which print and digital book objects need to be produced independently. In so doing, we draw upon recent work by Jacqueline Wernimont and Elizabeth Losh that uses the model of intra-action and distributed agency to explore how the method of production—be it print or digital—acts on, or produces, new modes of reading and new readers. We are also extending Jessica Brantley's insights into how the design of the codex form and the design of digital reading interfaces helps determine reading practices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>My topic in this paper is De anima II 5. Much of the extensive literature on De anima II 5, and on Aristotle's theory perception quite generally, is at least tacitly animated by an interest in the difficulties we think stand in the way of making progress in the theory of perception: roughly put, difficulties of explaining intentionality and consciousness without falling into dualism. My main contention will be that Aristotle's own preoccupations, which he inherits from his predecessors, are rather different. The problem he thinks needs getting around does not have to do with how animals manage to represent the world at all (whether accurately or not), nor with how they manage to be aware of how they represent it as being, but rather with how they manage to discriminate correctly, and thereby successfully navigate, salient features of their environments. Put another way, Aristotle's preoccupations are not with the problems of ‘intentionality' or of ‘consciousness,' but with the problem of ‘objectivity.'</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Aristotle maintains that defining nous requires first defining its activity, which requires first having considered its objects, intelligible beings. This paper is about the nature of these objects: what about them makes them intelligible? My principal proposals will be that what makes them intelligible is that they are ‘separate' and ‘unmixed,' and that because, insofar as they are intelligible, they are, in their essence, ‘activity.' I am not unaware that this makes it sound as though Aristotle takes intelligibility to consist in some kind of nous. But he himself virtually says as much, when he claims that nous is the ‘form' of its objects (lit. e?d?? e?d??); besides it is a result he is committed to by the doctrines that nous is intelligible and that there is something that intelligible objects ‘all are in common'; for the alternative, as he himself says, is to suppose that nous ‘will have something mixed-in, which makes it intelligible just like the rest.' The challenge, then, is not to steer clear of this result, but to make sense of it. My proposal will be that the key lies in realizing that and why Aristotle thinks intelligibility is a creature of nous.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Chile's sweeping labour code of 1931, domestic servants were (among other workers) explic-itly excluded from a number of provisions, leaving them to rely on the state's social welfare office for medical care and minimal oversight of their labor relations. In the years following that exclusion – and throughout the popular fronts, 1938-1952 – female domestic workers regularly petitioned the Labour Office, demanding payment of salaries and severance, as well as an end to employer abuses. Based on these interactions and servant use of CSO clinics, numerous le-gal, social work, and religious professionals went on to write lengthy treatises describing the negative effects of household workers' exclusion from social legislation, advocating greater state protection. This paper draws on servant petitions, legal and social work studies, as well as newspaper, la-bour, and union records, to examine how female domestics and others understood their labour and their "rights": as workers, citizens, and mothers. The years of Chile's Popular Front re-gimes were critical years for the redefinition of "empleada" as a category in labour law and popular culture, which in turn contributed to the construction of myths of mestizaje and "raza chilena" that were so central to the chileanization project of Chile's populist regimes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Scholars have been the only ones able to easily access primary sources on Jane Addams and her work for social justice, social work, woman suffrage, immigrants, and peace. Over the past forty-five years, the Jane Addams Papers Project has been working to expand the audience for these critical papers. Whether through microfilm, print, or digital publication, the goal has been the same -- to bring Addams's  words, ideas and world to a large and varied public. With digital technology we have been able to expand access dramatically in the last five years. The Jane Addams Digital edition offers images of the documents, transcribed to be readable and searchable, indexed by subject and tags, and contextualized with identifications of the people, organizations and events discussed. Our goal is to do more than provide the documents to the public.  We are developing tools to encourage creative use of the materials – lesson plans for middle-school students, guides for National History Day projects, and crowdsourcing tools to enable the public to participate in the project. We will continue to expand these offerings as more materials are published and hope to invite scholars, teachers, and students to contribute their analyses to the educational part of the site.  By making the data that underlies the edition accessible to digital humanities scholars, we will develop datasets that can be used by open source tools to analyze and interpret the papers. From maps that plot Addams's correspondence and associates, to social network visualizations and text analyses of her speeches and correspondence, the digital edition will encourage new questions and analysis that would not have been possible a short time ago. We look forward to working with users of all ages and interests in order to bring Jane Addams into the 21st century.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent targeted research analyzing these newspaper advertisements reveals that, to an extent heretofore unappreciated, enslaved people frequently utilized the sea as a viable route to escape bondage, especially from the coastal regions and ports of the Deep South. From the moment of colonization in North America through the beginning of the twentieth century, the use of waterways to establish and maintain commerce increased exponentially. With the rise of maritime commerce, ports expanded to accommodate growing demand. The increased frequency of imported and exported goods and services directly correlates with the rise of runaway slave advertisements that allude to the use of vessels or maritime routes in the suspected escape of fugitives. As fleeing individuals turned towards waterways to escape the bonds of slavery, slaveowners increasingly reflected their fears of fugitive egress by sea in their advertisements, warning the public to be vigilant in ports.  What follows, then, is not limited to a discussion of the value of runaway slave advertisements and the necessity of a centralized database, though they do speak to the larger inquiry at hand in this maritime Underground Railroad volume. Instead, this chapter emphasizes the ways that runaway slave advertisements inform discussions about North American slavery while focusing specifically on the prominence of maritime and other waterborne escapes. By deconstructing the advertisements and considering their basic elements, historians and future scholars can better understand the ways in which these advertisements illuminate aspects of slavery that intersect with theories of eco- nomics, culture, law, politics, race, and gender.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using New Orleans ads from the Freedom on the Move database, Mitchell traces the routes and strategies of enslaved people who fled their enslavers in antebellum New Orleans but remained in the city.  She argues that urban runaways resisted by reclaiming their labor and its profits from their enslavers--"lurking but working" in the city to support themselves.  In one of the largest ports in the country, and the largest in the South, both men (often on the levees) and women (in the markets) could sustain themselves while finding brief intervals of freedom.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>(book abstract) This anthology explores connections between dress and modernity through interdisciplinary French humanities scholarship. It brings to life the reciprocal relationships between fashion and a range of primary source materials, including literary fiction, paintings, social commentaries, decorative arts, fashion magazines, mass-circulating newspapers, popular theatrical works, trade publications, and advertisements, among others.The book centers on a specific constellation of concerns—fashion, modernity, and materiality from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries—giving depth of focus.Themes include fashion's relationship to the arts, material production, conflict, memory, the nation, social class, race, and gender and sexuality.Among the broader questions framing the volume are some that remain highly pertinent today:What are the various and complex relationships that exist between clothing and the lived body? How do garments hold traces of the past and activate memories of the human experience? In which ways do clothing and adornment express sexualities? How does fashion help to define what it meant and means to be modern? Together, the essays demonstrate fashion's broad reach and appeal as an interdisciplinary category of analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>‘A colored spiral in a small ball of glass, this is how I see my own life,' writes Vladimir Nabokov in his memoir, Speak, Memory. In our course "What is Memory?" we read and write with Nabokov's life story using our own form of Gregory Ulmer's ‘mystory' mode of writing as a way to discover the life cycles of memories--ours and our students as well as those related by Nabokov--and to explore their tendencies to constellate around images, objects, and their metaphorical relations--the spiral, for instance. Following Ulmer, our mystory is modeled after Roland Barthes' A Lover's Discourse. Like A Lover's Discourse, it is based on a ‘tutor text': A Lover's Discourse's tutor text is Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther; ours is Nabokov's Speak, Memory. Like A Lover's Discourse, our Mystory consists of a collection of ‘figures,' short open-ended compositions in which we write with and after Nabokov, weaving our responses to the autobiography with our own and each other's memories, including autobiographical and collective memories as well as memories of other texts. This ‘weaving' process is supported by our use of Scalar (http://scalar.usc.edu/), a multi-modal web-authoring platform, as the environment for our collaborative work. Coupling the responsive mystory mode of studying a memoir to the collaborative SCALAR writing environment facilitates students' appreciation of the similarities between life writing and story writing, thereby also helping them to recognize the activity of remembering as itself a creative process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Focusing on neighborhood life in Soviet-era Baku Azerbaijan, this paper juxtaposes Soviet experience in Baku with the post-Soviet production of the concept of the "Bakuvian" as an ideal type—its own, supra-ethnic nationality. In unpacking the relationships that constituted Baku's multi-ethnic fabric, the article draws particular attention to the interplay of Baku's spatial materiality and its various neighborhoods' gender codes, examining how these latter gave voice to particular ethnic and national identities. It shows how the "bakinets," as an ideal type, elides tension between these particularities, serving as a dynamic and contested symbol of the city's present and future.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I argue that Hegel's immaterialist metaphysics provides a viable alternative to those dissatisfied with a "disenchanted" materialism. I defend a "minimalist critique of materialism." I show that what Hegel criticizes in materialism is not the reality of matter, but only its ultimate reality. I show that he maintains a "minimalist conception of immateriality." I argue that he operates with a very specific notion of matter referring to mutually independent entities formed by means of external action upon them. So he is referring to entities that are not material, i.e. that are not mutually interrelated and/or are formed by means of their internal activity upon themselves. Adopting this "minimalist conception," Hegel thinks, changes how we see the way things are. He thus starts to speak about how all things strive toward some ultimate immateriality. This is the "transformational conception of immateriality." While this part of Hegel's critique is problematic, I contend that Hegel's extravagances are just his way of incorporating an expansive, "re-enchanted" conception of nature that allows material reality to exist alongside immaterial entities as Hegel conceives them.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, I defend the claim that Hegel employs a transcendental methodology to the study of mind in his Philosophy of Spirit. I focus on a key passage from §441 Anm., which sets the trajectory for his study of "the intelligence."  I argue that this passage reveals a profound, novel, and entirely overlooked commitment to a transcendental methodology in his work. I distinguish, following Franks, between types of transcendental argument, and I demonstrate that the approach Hegel follows here differs from the one Taylor finds in the "Consciousness" chapter of the Jena Phenomenology. Rather, as I argue, Hegel employs a circular or, as we may also call it, an organic transcendental approach to the study of mind. I show that his methodological approach is not a one-size-fits-all, mechanistic crank that churns out dialectic outputs from given inputs. Rather, it displays a surprising sensitivity to a study of the subject matter at hand: as Hegel himself avows at several points, the dialectic must allow a moment of passivity, whereby it conforms itself to meet the varying complexity of the objects of study.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper seeks a middle ground between two prevailing approaches to moral constraint in Hegel's philosophy:  the post-Kantian constructivism defended, for instance, in Pippin (2008) and the moral realism on offer, most prominently, in McDowell's various works (especially (1996)).  Briefly, the constructivist argues that moral values like freedom, right, and the good are distinctively human achievements that are, so to speak, "made more than found." The realist argues that moral values are "there," or may be read off as moral situational facts by those who are properly attuned to them. Such beings, McDowell says, are open to a "second nature," the reception of which contains moral valuations that are not, themselves, products of the spontaneity of thought. In this paper, I seek a moderate position between these two.  I argue that, for Hegel, the values of an ethical order are constituted from out of introspectively accessible moral "impulses" [Triebe].  Participation in an ethical life involves treating those impulses as the basic "contents" of one's thinking about practical matters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Spain has for too long been considered peripheral to the human catastrophes of World War II and the Holocaust. This volume is the first broadly interdisciplinary, scholarly collection to situate Spain in a position of influence in the history and culture of the Second World War. Featuring essays by international experts in the fields of history, literary studies, cultural studies, political science, sociology, and film studies, this book clarifies historical issues within Spain while also demonstrating the impact of Spain's involvement in the Second World War on historical memory of the Holocaust.  Many of the contributors have done extensive archival research, bringing new information and perspectives to the table, and in many cases the essays published here analyze primary and secondary material previously unavailable in English. Spain, the Second World War, and the Holocaust reaches beyond discipline, genre, nation, and time period to offer previously unknown evidence of Spain's continued relevance to the Holocaust and the Second World War.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Addressing texts produced by writers who lived through the Civil War and wrote about it before the end of Reconstruction, this collection explores the literary cultures of that unsettled moment when memory of the war had yet to be overwritten by later impulses of reunion, reconciliation, or Lost Cause revisionism. The Civil War reshaped existing literary cultures or enabled new ones. Ensembles of discourses, conventions, and practices, these cultures offered fresh ways of engaging a host of givens about American character and values that the war called into question.  The volume's contributors look at how literary cultures of the 1860s and 1870s engaged concepts of nation, violence, liberty, citizenship, community, and identity. At the same time, the essayists analyze the cultures themselves, which included Euroamerican and African American vernacular oral, manuscript (journals and letters), and print (newspapers, magazines, or books) cultures; overlapping discourses of politics, protest, domesticity, and sentiment; unsettled literary nationalism and emergent literary regionalism; and vernacular and elite aesthetic traditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay surveys the literate culture of the antebellum and Civil War eras among marginal southerners – African Americans, both free and enslaved, and poor and middle-class whites – and explores examples of the ways reading and writing, though quite distinct in formal pedagogies, blended together in the literary lives of the self-educated. Focused especially on Basil Armstrong Thomasson, a yeoman farmer in North Carolina whose diary records his reading practices as well as original verse, and John M. Washington, a Virginia man who kept a diary while enslaved, the essay presents a study in the surprising complexity and variegation of the textual landscape such people inhabited and helped create. It also discusses the scarcer archival traces of the literacy practices of ordinary southern women.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Visions of Glory brings together twenty-two images and twenty-two brisk essays, each essay connecting an image to the events that unfolded during a particular year of the Civil War. The book focuses on a diverse set of images that include a depiction of former slaves whipping their erstwhile overseer distributed by an African American publisher, a census graph published in the New York Times, and a cutout of a child's hand sent by a southern mother to her husband at the front. The essays in this collection reveal how wartime women and men created both written accounts and a visual register to make sense of this pivotal period.  The collection proceeds chronologically, providing a nuanced history by highlighting the multiple meanings an assorted group of writers and readers discerned from the same set of circumstances. In so doing, this volume assembles contingent and fractured visions of the Civil War, but its differing perspectives also reveal a set of overlapping concerns. A number of essays focus in particular on African American engagements with visual culture. The collection also emphasizes the role that women played in making, disseminating, or interpreting wartime images. While every essay explores the relationship between image and word, several contributions focus on the ways in which Civil War images complicate an understanding of canonical writers such as Emerson, Melville, and Whitman.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The idea of freedom is definitive for both Kant's definition of beauty and his description of the sublime.  In beauty, humans experience a free lawfulness: a state in which we are guided by but not restricted to conceptual analysis.  In the sublime, we are reminded of the freedom that allows us to transcend even the fear of death.  Although Hegel's definition of freedom and his philosophy of art differ significantly from Kant's, the idea that art allows us to experience freedom is common to both philosophers.  Humans' understanding of freedom is pivotal to the emergence of artistic genres from the Egyptian sphinx to the romantic novel, according to Hegel; it also explains the joy we experience through painting and especially through poetry.  This essay will trace this Kantian inheritance in Hegel's thought.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The women of the Junta de Damas de Honor y Mérito of the Real Sociedad Económica Matritense projected a collective identity as authors through the reports about their activities that they wrote, presented in public ceremonies, and published in Madrid. They claimed corporate identity through the paratexts of their published speeches accepting membership, and they signaled feminine networks in the paratexts of their published eulogies to their royal sponsors. They strategically claimed a voice in the public sphere through their publications and public ceremonies, a type of feminine self-fashioning as civic reformers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Academic libraries and teaching departments sometimes treat Digital Humanities (DH) as radically new. While DH is radically new in terms of collaborative practices and methods, it is also fundamentally rooted in the humanities and intricately connected to core activities by librarians, especially for collaboration. In this chapter, we explain how the UF Smathers Libraries leveraged the library digital collections—with rich technical features and content, and a robust underlying infrastructure—to create the necessary scholarly cyberinfrastructure to then support the DH community for an environment of radical collaboration. To do so, we show how librarians leveraged the new DH opportunities to fundamentally enrich and improve existing, seemingly more traditional work, including collection development, library scholarly councils, collaboration among libraries for print and digital collections, outreach and instruction, and more.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Latin American and Caribbean Collection, the Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica, and the Panama Canal Museum Collection at the George A. Smathers Libraries, University of Florida, have been central to digital library projects and innovative instruction at UF, with other institutions, and internationally.  The Isser and Rae Price Judaica Library holds internationally distinctive Judaica from the 19th and 20th centuries, with exceptionally rare festschriften, ephemera, and periodicals forming the foundation for the foremost Jewish Studies research collection in the southeastern United States.   The Latin American and Caribbean Collection (LACC) traces its pre-eminence to the Farmington Plan and close ties with the renowned Center for Latin America Studies, with exceptional manuscript collections on the Caribbean. The Panama Canal Museum Collection began as a community repository focused largely on American experiences but has been integrated into SASC as an international collection.  Each of these collections has been deeply involved in the multi-institutional digital initiatives of the Libraries, which are structured to facilitate participation and sharing of resources by universities, national repositories, and small heritage organizations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Situated at the crossroads of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Spanish Philippines offer historians an intriguing middle ground of connected histories that raises fundamental new questions about conventional ethnic, regional and religious identities. This volume adds a new global perspective to the history of the Philippines by juxtaposing Iberian, Chinese and Islamic perspectives. By navigating various underexplored archival resources, senior and junior scholars from Asia, Europe and the Americas explore the diverse cultural, religious, and economic flows that shaped the early modern Philippine milieu. By zooming in from the global to the local, this book offers eleven fascinating Philippine case studies of early modern globalization.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper presents the preliminary results from the first two seasons of the Arizona Sicily Project, an intensive diachronic survey in the coastal territory between the Sicilian cities of Marsala and Mazara del Vallo. The project's primary research aim is to document the quantities of North African imports to western Sicily in all periods, in order to reconstruct North African connections to the peoples of this part of the island. Previous work in the region has demonstrated episodes of North African materials making their way across the Sicilian Channel in punctuated periods from the Palaeolithic onwards, but this project is the first to attempt to document and quantify those contacts over all periods, to understand the deep history of these relations, and how they distinguish the western third of the island from other parts of Sicily. Material evidence of contemporary migrant crossings of the Channel from Tunisia highlight the enduring character of these North African connections.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Animal Histories of the Civil War Era introduces the concept of animal history to Civil War studies. Until now, the field of animal history has paid little attention to the Civil War, and Civil War scholars have paid almost no attention to animals. This volume serves as an intersection of these two critical fields of scholarly inquiry. In thirteen essays, ten by Civil War historians and three by animal history scholars, the contributors illuminate an important but largely ignored aspect of the war-its animal participants. The topics covered are wide-ranging. One essay examines camels in the American South and Southwest before the war, highlighting the involvement of camels in illegal efforts to import slaves into the United States. Essays on horses during the war explore the process of procuring equines for military service, the training of horses for use by artillery units, and the impact of horse supply problems on hopes for Confederate military success. Two essays cover wildlife in the Civil War, focusing on bees. An essay on hogs in the Confederacy and another on the culture of meat-eating examine animals as food during the war. Two essays on dogs in the South during and after the war illustrate how pets and farm animals influenced slavery and the prosecution of the Confederate war effort. An essay on regimental animal mascots during the war analyzes how veterans incorporated them into their post-war lives. Another essay explores the effort to create a national zoo in the 1880s, a task that underscored the persistence of sectional division after Reconstruction. The final essay likewise examines sectional division and the resonance of enslavement as seen in the career of an ex-slave and his unusual show horse. Through the process of broadly writing animals into Civil War history, the contributors demonstrate the many ways in which animals of all kinds played roles in the sectional history of America during the middle and late nineteenth century.

		<Abstract>Studies focusing on the history of childhood in the Ottoman world maintain that the extant sources allow for a limited view of how the idea of childhood was perceived  in  the early modern period. Compared to the sources of European history, historical accounts on Ottoman children and biographical narratives focusing on children's lives are rare in the Ottoman context. Nevertheless the Shari‘ah court records and fatwa  collections that reflect the daily concerns of the populace are primary documents that inform on children's lives and attitudes toward childhood. These normative–theoretical sources offer only a partial view of children's relationship to their surroundings, as well as their reception by society at large.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter is predominantly concerned with the 18th century without overlooking the period between the 15th and 18th centuries, so as to provide readers with a comparative perspective. The first part focuses on the nature of the early modern neighborhood with regard to kinship ties, communal relationships, and individual agency. How were Istanbul's neighborhoods formed? What were the ties between inhabitants of neighborhoods? What kind of influence did residents have over the moral and social composition of this space? Questions regarding the religious, ethnic, economic, and social allegiances that shaped the characteristics of neighborhoods are among the chapter's larger concerns. The institution of family formed a central part of neighborhood life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This collection analyzes the theme of the "afterlife" as it animated nineteenth-century American women's theology-making and appeals for social justice. Authors like Harriet Beecher Stowe, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Martha Finley, Jarena Lee, Maria Stewart, Zilpha Elaw, Rebecca Cox Jackson, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Belinda Marden Pratt, and others wrote to have a voice in the moral debates that were consuming churches and national politics. These texts are expressions of the lives and dynamic minds of women who developed sophisticated, systematic spiritual and textual approaches to the divine, to their denominations or religious traditions, and to the mainstream culture around them. Women do not simply live out theologies authored by men. Rather, Nineteenth-Century American Women Writers and Theologies of the Afterlife: A Step Closer to Heaven is grounded in the radical notion that the theological principles crafted by women and derived from women's experiences, intellectual habits, and organizational capabilities are foundational to American literature itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A sensory approach to the study of ancient funerary rituals offers fresh insights into the sights, sounds, tastes, textures, and smells of death and burial. This chapter situates the varied roles of corpses—and their attendant olfactory, visual, and tactile characteristics—in funerary rituals of the second millennium bce Levant. The study argues that close and continuing interaction with human remains in reused intramural burials played a significant role in the transformation of the social status of the dead after burial. Intramural burials occurred widely throughout the region and will be presented through two case studies: Royal Hypogeum at Qatna in Syria (c. 1800–1350 bce); and Tomb 100 at Tel Megiddo in Israel (c. 1600–1450 bce). Additionally, this chapter devotes special attention to novel sensory experiences that have yet to be addressed involving use of mind-altering substances in funerary rituals of the ancient Near East. Altering the mind could both mitigate unpleasant conditions of shared burial spaces and enhance mourners' interactions with the dead as bodies and as persons.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter presents a synthesis of major cultural developments in ancient Palestine from the Early Bronze Age through end of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 3600–1100 BCE). It traces diachronic patterns of settlement, urbanism, architecture, material culture, trade, and relationships between inhabitants of Palestine and their neighbors. Taking a critical approach to issues of ethnicity and identity, this chapter problematises traditional models that view population movement and displacement as primary drivers of cultural change. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that development of social complexity was a nonlinear process impacted by internal and external variables.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The excavation of the courtyard house of Level K-10 in Area K (Chapter 2.1) yielded a considerable number of intramural burials. Burying in this manner was a well-known practice in the southern Levant in general during this period and at Megiddo in particular. The Megiddo burials were installed under the floors of the domestic unit, and in two cases alongside its exterior wall, lowered into the brick framework of the Middle Bronze fortification. Ceramic and radiocarbon data suggest that some of the burials were dug only after the Level K-10 house was abandoned (and before the Level K-9 house was constructed), defining a late Level K-10 burial phase. In this chapter, 15 graves and a total of 21 individuals are presented.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Book abstract: Long viewed as a tabula rasa, the deserts of the American West have played a distinct role in the projection of American cultural identities. Historically represented through fantasies of individualism, frontier ruggedness, and land acquisition, the desert is also the site of extreme social and environmental violence. The Invention of the American Desert brings together a wide-ranging group of interdisciplinary essays that explore, through diverse perspectives, dialectical problems posed by an environment that has served as a testing ground for modernist experimentation in art and architecture, military-industrial incursions, and ecological disasters throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In light of the urgent climate crisis and the planet's increasing desertification, this volume reflects on the nature and legacy of the desert as a crucible for competing visions of land, environment, and art.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>As prequels to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), the two novels that comprise Kenneth Oppel's ‘The Apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein' series introduce young adult (YA) readers to the Frankenstein family through the eyes of a teenage Victor. In doing so, This Dark Endeavour (2011) and Such Wicked Intent (2012) serve as what Thomas Leitch calls ‘entry-level introductions' (72) not only to the characters and themes of canonical literature, but also to their original historical contexts and authors. Oppel's series is particularly notable for its ideological commitment to ‘leveling the playing field' with regard to representing gender. Even though the books are set in the late eighteenth century, the character of Elizabeth Lavenza, in particular, is radically rewritten as an active, driving character in Oppel's series, a radical departure from Shelley's characterisation of Victor's betrothed and a reflection of a broader trend towards strong female characters in contemporary YA fiction. However, as is often the case with post-feminist approaches to YA literature, there are limitations to the contemporary approach.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In Ya dystopian fiction, the Girl on Fire constitutes one manifestation of a figure that anita Harris (2004) calls "the Future Girl." In other genres, the Future Girl takes other forms. as we will argue, in Ya adaptations of nineteenth- century novels (henceforth, Ya neo–Victorian novels), the Future Girl often takes the form of a close "ancestor" of the Girl on Fire: the Historical Bad Girl. Like the Girl on Fire, the Historical Bad Girl also appears to resist her society's conservative gender ideologies and binaries. an exceptional individual, she is intelligent, competitive, sexually desirable, and (in some cases) athletic. However liberating these portrayals may be, we argue that like the Girl on Fire, the Historical Bad Girl is capable of reproducing narratives associated with postfeminism, which holds that in a world where men and women compete on a level playing field, feminism is no longer necessary. In the sections to follow, we present a critical framework that we suggest teachers can use with students to support their investigating of whether Ya novels engage in or resist postfeminist and neoliberal discourse. We then apply our framework to a Ya neo–Victorian novel, This Dark Endeavor (2011), the first book in Kenneth Oppel's two- volume the apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein series. In doing so, our intention is to demonstrate how, by depicting the character of elizabeth Lavenza as a Historical Bad Girl, Oppel's novel inadvertently engages in narratives associated with postfeminism, despite actively trying to rewrite elizabeth as a strong, female lead for twentyfirst- century readers. although our focus in this essay is on the genre of Ya neo–Victorian novels, our framework is applicable to other genres of Ya literature, including realistic dystopian fiction. to conclude, we examine the implications of students' interrogating representations of Historical Bad Girls and Girls on Fire in Ya literature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>It is all but inevitable for literary history to be divided into periods. "Early American," "antebellum," "modern," "post-1945"—such designations organize our knowledge of the past and shape the ways we discuss that past today. These periods tend to align with the watershed moments in American history, even as the field has shifted its perspective away from the nation-state. It is high time we rethink these defining periods of American literary history, as the drawing of literary timelines is a necessary—even illuminating—practice.  In these short, spirited, and imaginative essays, 23 leading Americanists gamely fashion new, unorthodox literary periods—from 600 B.C.E. to the present, from the Age of Van Buren to the Age of Microeconomics. They bring to light literary and cultural histories that have been obscured by traditional timelines and raise provocative questions. What is our definition of "modernism" if we imagine it stretching from 1865 to 1965 instead of 1890 to 1945? How does the captivity narrative change when we consider it as a contemporary, not just a "colonial," genre? What does the course of American literature look like set against the backdrop of federal denials of Native sovereignty or housing policies that exacerbated segregation?  Filled with challenges to scholars, inspirations for teachers (anchored by an appendix of syllabi), and entry points for students, Timelines of American Literature gathers some of the most exciting new work in the field to showcase the revelatory potential of fresh thinking about how we organize the literary past.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Sound positions individuals as social subjects. The presence of human beings, animals, objects, or technologies reverberates into the spaces we inhabit and produces distinct soundscapes that render social practices, group associations, and socio-cultural tensions audible. The Acoustics of the Social on Page and Screen unites interdisciplinary perspectives on the social dimensions of sound in audiovisual and literary environments. The essays in the collection discuss soundtracks for shared values, group membership, and collective agency, and engage with the subversive functions of sound and sonic forms of resistance in American literature, film, and TV.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The years between the 1920s and 1970s are key for the development of Caribbean literature, producing the founding canonical literary texts of the Anglophone Caribbean. This volume features essays by major scholars as well as emerging voices revisiting important moments from that era to open up new perspectives. Caribbean contributions to the Harlem Renaissance, to the Windrush generation publishing in England after World War II, and to the regional reverberations of the Cuban Revolution all feature prominently in this story. At the same time, we uncover lesser known stories of writers publishing in regional newspapers and journals, of pioneering women writers, and of exchanges with Canada and the African continent. From major writers like Derek Walcott, V.S. Naipaul, George Lamming, and Jean Rhys to recently recuperated figures like Eric Walrond, Una Marson, Sylvia Wynter, and Ismith Khan, this volume sets a course for the future study of Caribbean literature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The mind is fundamentally a matter of employing mental capacities in virtue of which we represent our environment as being a certain way. These mental capacities can take the form of concepts or low-level discriminatory capacities as they are used in perception. Understanding the mind in this way allows for a clear way of understanding how sensory states and, more generally, mental states are grounded in the physical. Being in an intentional state is understood in terms of engaging in a mental activity, namely employing mental capacities. In this paper, I show how understanding the mind in terms of employing mental capacities allows for a physicalist understanding of the mind while holding on to what is unique about mental states.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This paper develops a distinctive externalist view of knowledge according to which mental capacities are explanatory basic. This capacity view is an externalist view that does not invoke reliability, remains steadfastly naturalistic, and in recognizing a metaphysically substantive common element between perception and hallucination avoids any commitment to disjunctivism. So it argues for a view of epistemic externalism that does not entail any version of epistemic disjunctivism. The basic idea of this capacity view is that in experience we employ perceptual capacities that function to discriminate and single out particulars in our environment. It is because a given subject is employing a perceptual capacity with a certain nature that her mental states have epistemic force. Employing such perceptual capacities yields a mental state that provides us with phenomenal evidence, and employing such capacities in the good case also provides us with knowledge-worthy factive evidence. In perceptual Gettier cases the subject only has phenomenal evidence and so lacks sufficient evidence for knowledge. This approach is distinctive in three respects: it groups perceptual Gettier cases in with hallucinations, it treats both via a lack of sufficient evidence (rather than through invoking some sort of fourth condition), and it divides up perceptual Gettier cases from fake barn cases and broken clock cases. The underlying picture of perceptual knowledge avoids the pitfalls of both externalist disjunctivist views and internalist views, while revealing what is right in both externalist and internalist approaches. The capacity view is an externalist view that does not invoke reliability, remains steadfastly naturalistic, and in recognizing a metaphysically substantive common element between perception and hallucination avoids any commitment to disjunctivism. I show how this view allows us to acknowledge internalist insights by arguing that mental state are constituted by the perceptual</Abstract>

		<Abstract>People who want to learn about history also want to learn about it in the ways and through the media that they prefer. Sometimes it happens by reading a book, with the learner at home in a comfy chair in front of a fire. But sometimes - especially now, in the smartphone era - meaningful history-learning moments can occur just about anywhere. So, historians need to adapt. This chapter outlines how history-seeking audiences have always followed advances in communication technologies and how mobile technologies today simply offer opportunities for the next period of field expansion. The desirable affordances of smartphones can be traced conceptually back to the earliest people who read about historical events on papyrus scrolls (much more mobile than stone monuments), through volumes of bound papers cranked out on the printing press (prompting the need for mass literacy), and in complicated multimedia contexts (like with text and graphics overlaying video on television screens). As a confluence of the media that have come before it but also as a bridge to emerging forms of new media, mobile media are only now starting to be understood as viable media for history. This piece puts the intellectual foundations in place for such an exploration and also presents some reflections on work like this from a pioneer in the field, who has been designing locative historical experiences for more than a decade.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The built environment delineates space for daily actions and important moments. Separating the occupants from the external world, walls can create barriers between the outside or can build communities within them. In archaeological literature, the term ‘house' often describes the architecture of settled peoples, painting visual images of sturdy stone structures dotting the landscape in perpetuity. In part, this image is constructed as the result of archaeological preservation; stone houses have longevity, with foundations and walls standing for thousands of years. In contrast, ephemeral and organic structures such as tents and brush huts are rarely preserved, and thus escape our conceptions of house and home in the past (Maher and Conkey, 2019). Issues of visibility are also intertwined with site function; what is visible archaeologically may be activity areas that do not relate to the domicile, which may be at a different location, and thus not identified in the archaeological record (Briz i Godino et al., 2013, Zubrow et al., 2010). This has led to a bias where mobile peoples are often forgotten in discussions of household archaeology, with a primacy placed on people who build permanent architecture. However, despite our modern biases, hunter-gatherers did (and do) have structures. Furthermore, as recently argued by Maher and Conkey (2019), these structures can convey a sense of ‘home', a concept usually reserved for sedentary people. Homes are where ‘life happens', where people interact with each other and with the objects in their lives. Not only are homes loci for ‘life', they themselves also live, undergoing changes, evolving with the inhabitants, and transitioning through rites of passage (Tringham, 1995). Recent excavations of two structures at Kharaneh IV, an Epipalaeolithic site in Eastern Jordan, provides a window into the lifeways of a hunter-gatherer community by reconstructing the life-history of the structures.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Artistic objects are thought to be one of the hallmarks of the Natufian period, marking a florescence of artistic behavior appearing prior to the origins of agriculture. However, with continuing research into Early and Middle Epipalaeolithic sites in the Levant, new discoveries of ‘symbolic' artifacts are increasing our understanding of even earlier artistic and symbolic pursuits. In this paper we present an engraved plaquette from the Middle Epipalaeolithic context of Kharaneh IV, eastern Jordan. Using imaging confocal microscopy, we analyze manufacturing traces to identify the gestures and tools used to create the plaquette. This artifact, although the only engraved piece recovered from Kharaneh IV thus far, links into wider networks of Epipalaeolithic interaction and cultural exchange. Placing the Kharaneh IV engraved object into regional context with other Early/Middle Epipalaeolithic artistic artifacts, we explore wider networks of interaction prior to the Natufian.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In many parts of the Middle East, both in the past and present, sustainable occupation is dependent on highly variable water resources within sensitive local ecosystems. In the Azraq Basin of eastern Jordan, dramatic landscape changes from wetlands to desert resulted in major shifts in settlement and land use over time. Within the last few decades, several springs in the central Azraq Oasis have ceased to flow and the once-rich marshland is drying up, with devastating effects for local communities. Palaeoenvironmental research in the Azraq Basin suggests that, like today, water availability was a crucial factor for past populations. Changing environmental conditions throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene had significant impacts on human population movements and land use. Recent work at the site of Kharaneh IV (19.8–18.6 kya) indicates settlement of this intensively used aggregation site around the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26.5–19 kya) and abandonment by the start of a second drying period, Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 18–15.5 kya).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The application of new technologies to the study of cultural objects is inexorable, driven by intense human curiosity and the profound mysteries of the past. The long term diffusion of technology into cultural studies and the humanities has matured in this technical age, becoming much less invasive and remarkably precise, even revelatory. For example, one of the first non-medical applications of computed tomography (CT), achieved within two years of CT's commercial development in the 1970s,1 was the visualization of the internal structure of ancient Egyptian mummies. Similarly, conservation of and scholarship with manuscripts have become increasingly technology-oriented.2 With the advent of technical approaches that are more and more precise and at the same time less and less invasive, research is accelerating and diffusing into new fields, spawning novel techniques that reveal new information. The rapid technological advances over the last decade have led to exciting, innovative approaches to the study of cultural heritage objects. One of the most promising and increasingly used technologies is that of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Like medical CT scans, micro-CT is an "X-ray transmission image technique"3 that combines the penetrating clarity of x-rays with the speed, precision, and accuracy of computers. While X-ray technology offers a two-dimensional glimpse through an object, micro-computed tomography generates a highly detailed 3D image of the entire internal structure of an object, revealing its inner features.4 Just as X-ray and computed tomography revolutionized medicine when they were discovered (the responsible scientists received Nobel prizes for their work, German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen in 1901 and Allan McLeod Cormack and Godrey Houndsfield jointly in 1979), today's micro-CT capabilities are similarly transforming the study of cultural heritage.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The central aim in this essay is to show that by the end of the nineteenth century, missionaries and Indian nationalists were engaged in a contest not so much over conversion, but over the cultural personality or imagining of the Indian nation. Rather than competing for the "souls of Indians," they competed for the "soul of India." Missionaries supported Indian nationalism when, even  in  its  most  Hindu  colors,  it  manifested  signs  of  "the  Christian  impact"  on India. Conversely, Indian nationalism achieved its greatest autonomy from missionary  influence  when  it  ceased  to  allow  Christian  religious  or  societal  norms to measure its own legitimacy. This dialectical quest for agency and autonomy within nationalist consciousness can be viewed with greater clarity by applying theoretical tools found in some of the more recent studies on nationalism to the specific urban contexts of Calcutta and Madras from 1880 to 1908.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On 18 September 1929, Rudolf Strothmann (1877–1960) embarked on a trip to the Middle East, in the course of which he travelled to Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, Anatolia, the Levant, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, and Yemen. He returned to Hamburg on 10 May 1930, nearly eight months after his departure. The trip is documented in three detailed letters (or Ansichtskarten, as he calls them) that Strothmann sent to Carl Heinrich Becker (1876–1933) on 19 December 1929, 10 March 1930, and 8 May 1930. This paper offers an edition of Strothmann's third Ansichtskarten to Carl Heinrich Becker, with annotations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Over the past decades, digital collections of texts produced by Muslim authors writing in Arabic during the premodern period have mushroomed. Major libraries include al-Maktaba al-Shamila, currently containing some 7,000 books; Noor Digital Library, with 35,169 books to date; PDF Books Library, currently containing 4,355 books; Arabic Collections Online (ACO), providing access to 15,131 volumes; Shia Online Library, with 4,715 books; and al-Maktaba al-Waqfiyya, containing some 10 million pages of published books (in addition to a growing number of manuscript surrogates), to name only the most important ones. Moreover, since printing technologies were adopted in the Islamic world at a relatively late stage and slow rate, [fig. 1] much of the written cultural production of the Islamic world is until today preserved in manuscript form. And although there has been a steady rise in the publication of manuscript catalogs all over the Islamic world over the past one hundred years, much material is still unaccounted for, and discoveries of titles that were believed to be lost or that were entirely unknown regularly occur. In parallel, numerous libraries have started to digitize their collections of Islamic manuscripts, and a fair number among them provide open access to their holdings through institutional digital repositories, in addition to a growing number of online gateways to Islamic manuscripts. At the same time, what is available online, whether published or in manuscript form, is only the tip of the iceberg ....</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With its many forms of guising, Ramlila is serious play, and by this it is not mean simply or primarily the metaphysical and "classical" connotations of the term "lila."  Over-attention to this centuries-old term risks obfuscating the material conditions of Ramlila performers and invisibilizing the social structures of inclusion and exclusion on the ground of Ramlila culture. Rather, what should be emphasized is the very real fun and sociality that often occurs in Ramlila—onstage, backstage, and offstage. On a social level, the sartorial and somatic guising of performers clearly creates a space for jouissance—pleasure, abandon, and escape. While sociality is a significant feature of Ramlila, this chapter primarily considers the ritual role and social significations of the svarups who serve in divine roles in Ramlila.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is an essay about God who pretends to be a man who pretends to be other kinds of men. Impersonation involves a dialectic of power that both plays on binaries and often opposes them as well. This dialectic is often formed as a juxtaposition of the normative—the personation—and the nonnormative—the impersonation. Like all dialectics, impersonation registers friction and power differentials. Here public impersonation is taken to be premised on a differential of social power and simultaneously a demonstration of that differential. This performance of impersonation can have many impulses: the reassertion of dominance perhaps, but also an expression of protest or cultural critique. Impersonation can find motivation in anxieties about social mobility, but it can also convey empathy and confessions of social inequality. For these reasons, this paper will view public impersonation as a social didactic and public practice that often exposes the nature of social inequality, even if unintentionally. The focus here will be on practices that would be positioned within the "social liberal" context of demonstrating social inequality around caste as a means of critiquing that inequality rather than reinforcing it.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The mutilation of the herms is among the best-documented and most notorious episodes of the Greeks' violence toward their own religious sculptures. This article draws on archaeological and artistic evidence to analyze how the Athenians responded to the mutilation of the herms. It identifies a range of visual strategies, from the retention of intact monuments to the repair of damaged ones and the ritual disposal of those too injured to restore, and also examines the creation of counter-monuments. Taken together, these works suggest a forceful yet nuanced response to the attack in its immediate aftermath, centered upon the maintenance of traditional religious sculptures and the erection of new monuments celebrating the power of the Athenian demos.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Under Roman rule, Aphrodisias in south-western Turkey profited considerably from its self-proclaimed status as the city of Aphrodite.  It attracted rich donations and special privileges from Late Republican generals such as Sulla — who sent a golden double axe to the goddess's temple, with an elaborate, self-aggrandizing dedication (Appian, Civil Wars 1.97) —  as well as from Roman emperors, above all Augustus, the first princeps (Smith 1993, 2-8).  By the Late Antique era, however, the city's association with the pagan goddess of love and beauty was no longer an advantage; rather, it was a problem in an increasingly Christian culture.  This paper examines the means by which the citizens of Aphrodisias eradicated the cult of Aphrodite, and in so doing transformed the visual landscape of their city.  Aphrodisias's rich archaeological and epigraphic record and the prominence of Aphrodite there make this a useful case study for the dissolution of a pagan goddess's cult in late antiquity.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article uses case studies of major artworks to compare and contrast Greek and Roman forms of commemoration through monuments.  The goal is a deeper understanding of how monuments functioned in Greece and Rome.  Also, since in the ancient world memory was constructed above all through monuments rather than texts, this has important implications for cultural memory.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter reads digitization as a form of translation that can also be read as activating the resources, not just of language, but of vision, screenic sensoria, and knowledge. Using these tropes to deepen our understanding of MSS 41 and 286 as powerfully transformative and performative texts, we can see how digitization activates new forms of presence, visibility and meaning that echo and extend the ways in which these books were received, transmitted and appropriated as manuscripts in medieval Britain.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter reconsiders the compilation of British Library MS Cotton Otho B.XI in light of recent developments in codicological theory and from the perspective of Winchester as a place where the manuscript was being copied, added to or otherwise altered. The first phase of copying took place in the middle of the tenth century, when the Otho copy of the Old English version of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica was made; the second phase took place at the beginning of the eleventh century, between 1001–12, when additional materials were added to Otho from Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 173. These stages correspond to the reigns of Edmund I (939–46), Eadred (946–55), Eadwig (955–9) and Æthelred (978–1016). By looking closely at the contents and differences between the two manuscripts as they changed over time, it is argued that the scribes who expanded Otho did not, as Patrick Wormald suggested, ‘wide[n] the scope of the Corpus 173 argument'; rather, the scribes of Otho created an entirely new composite book that provides both a record of and a resource for Christian kingship. In it, the compilers brought together a range of texts that explore the relationship between the king, his bishops and his people; the nation and its boroughs; the part and the whole.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Editor's introduction to a volume that explores some of the specific ways race was defined and mobilized by different groups—including the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Persians, and Ethiopians—as they came into contact with one another in the ancient world.  Key to this inquiry is the examination of institutions, such as religion and politics, and forms of knowledge, such as science, that circumscribed the formation of ancient racial identities and helped determine their meanings and consequences.  Drawing on a range of ancient evidence—literature, historical writing, documentary evidence, and ancient art and archaeology—this volume highlights both the complexity of ancient racial ideas and their support for the often violent and asymmetrical power structures embedded in racial representations and ancient practices like war and the enslavement of other persons.  The study of race in antiquity has long been clouded by modern assumptions, so this volume also seeks to outline a better method for apprehending race on its own terms in the ancient world, including its relationship to other forms of identity, such as ethnicity and gender, while also seeking to identify and debunk some of the racist methods and biases that have been promulgated by classical historians themselves over the last few centuries.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>How can one fashion anticolonial subjects in post (or neo) colonial time? How could projects of intellectual and cultural decolonization persist when anticolonial struggles in their armed and unarmed varieties had all but faded, and the revolutionary projects that formed in their wake have been eclipsed by internal strife, oppressive regimes, civil war, cooptation by former colonizers, and/or reactionary actors and discourses? What kind of theoretical and narratological arsenal does this moment demand to actualize its dual vision of a political future that is decolonized and of-its-time? This chapter reconstructs Laroui's Concepts Series as an expansive, multi-faceted and multi-layered response to a political-intellectual predicament encountered by Arab (and more generally, Global Southern) intellectuals in the 1980s and 1990s.  Published in five volumes over the course of sixteen years (1980-1996), the Concepts Series features five texts on Ideology (1980), Freedom (1981), The State (1981), History (1992) and Reason (1996). Diverse in their structure, narrative style, and prospective audience, these texts are retrospectively construed by Laroui as an extended examination of the central precepts of modern social and political thought ([1996] 2012, 14". Beyond their internal variety, and their author's posited unity, I read these texts as featuring two thrusts: the first is to analytically and firmly distinguish between pre-modern Islamic and modern European notions and practices of each of these concepts, and the second to emphasize (and where possible, argue for) the philosophical depth of classical Islamic conceptions of these concepts and the integrity of modern Arab adaptations of post-Enlightenment European traditions of political thinking.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines Laroui's ground-breaking philosophical oeuvre in the 1960s and 1970s. While commentaries on Laroui's early work (and on his work more generally) often read it as an extended critique of modern Arab social and political thought, then celebrate or dismiss it for its unequivocal commitment to what Laroui terms "modernity,"   my use of the lens of "reforming reformers and preparing revolutionaries" to interpret Laroui's early work unearths the political drive of his intervention and explores the way he actualizes that drive through conceptual and narratological devices. In deploying this prism, I attempt to read anticolonial texts as political interventions, not only in that they pitch a critique or chart a different political future, but in that they aim to undo the subjectivity they critique and produce that which they envision. I do this by dwelling on both what Laroui says and how he says it.Accordingly, my examination uses two registers. The first attends to the specifics of Laroui's argument, tracing its flow, defining, and situating its terms, and synthesizing its various parts into a narrative and theoretical arc. This register is significant not only because it is lacking in the existing literature, which tends to rehash CAI's arguments with a broad brush,  but also, and more importantly, because it renders legible and theoretically justifiable Laroui's diction, whose erudition and density often makes it obscure. In all, this register tries to get as close as possible, and stay as faithful as possible, to the substance of Laroui's argument and its overarching objectives (both explicit and implicit). If the first register tracks the twists, turns, and broad arches of Laroui's argument, the second register features my interpretation of what Laroui is doing. Here, I reconstruct the theoretical toolkit that Laroui uses but rarely announces, and carefully trace its workings and effects. It is also here that I closely follow Laroui's</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This critical edition presents the trilingual glossary in London, British Library, Manuscript Harley 219, a newly discovered text compiled and produced by Thomas Hoccleve (c. 1367-1426). Harley 219 contains four major literary texts and a glossary that were copied or corrected by Hoccleve in conjunction with fellow scribes at the Royal Office of the Privy Seal. A final, practical text added in the hand of a later Privy Seal clerk indicates that the volume remained in the hands of Hoccleve's colleagues after his death. There are modern editions of most of the literary texts: Odo of Cheriton's Fables, the Anglo-Latin Gesta Romanorum, Christine de Pizan's Epistre Othea, and a French Secretum Secretorum (and, indeed, Harley 219 has been consulted in some of them). However, the trilingual glossary has largely been overlooked until its connection to Hoccleve became apparent: it is a wordlist of French terms glossed in Latin, and less frequently, Middle English, and followed by a very short series of phrases in French and Middle English. This trilingual production offers evidence of how Hoccleve and fellow clerks approached French language and language learning, and it contains playful linguistic arrangements and at least one reference to Hoccleve's poetic works that are essential for understanding his audience and their engagement with French beyond their professional capacities as clerks. Throughout the introduction and notes of my edition, I argue that the glossary uniquely combines a variety of sources and demonstrates Hoccleve's own innovations in glossary structure and experimental language. The introduction contextualises the work within several relevant contexts from broad to narrow: late medieval glossaries and language-learning texts, Hoccleve's clerical career at the Royal Office of the Privy Seal, and the French and Latin works within the same codex.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jahanara Imam's war memoir Days of '71 presents an eye-witness account of the nine-month long liberation struggle blending a personal narrative with the political destiny of the nation. Through the lens of her memoir, this paper explores women's roles in war. It examines Imam as a nationalist in the unfolding political ferment and the continuing negotiations she undertakes with respect to Bengali nationalism in East Pakistan. Despite her staggering losses, Imam had a stake in nationalism, and her motherhood, as powerful as she feels it, does not obviate that. Finally, the paper asks whether a biological category like "motherhood" is relevant to the analyses and understanding of social phenomena such as war.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>These two chapters lay the foundation for my book's argument about the depth and breadth of Christine de Pizan's influence on Thomas Hoccleve, one of the most prominent poets after Chaucer. Chapter 1 traces the misogynist perspective Hoccleve brings to his translation of the Letter of Cupid to his position as a secular clerk, which causes him to identify paradoxically with the literary tradition Christine criticized yet also with Christine as writing outside traditional centers of authority. Chapter 2 demonstrates Hoccleve reacting to Christine's works through processes of further imitation, borrowing of her material, and negative depictions of women authorities as a means to defend his own status as a writer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Chapter 3 reconsiders the evidence of the Epistre Othea's influence on John Lydgate's Troy Book, Mummings, and Fall of Princes - tracing his views of Fortune, seen as "innovative" within the English tradition, to Christine's Othea, which he knew and used for Troy Book. Scholars have noted use of her content but not her overarching fiction of intervening in a classical hero's life to forestall his death or her view of men's misfortunes as the result of their own life choices, not a capricious goddess alone. Chapter 4 will amass the evidence to argue that Lydgate plausibly translated the version of the English Epistre Othea known as the Litel Bibell of Knyghthod and that it allowed for the intense, formative influence of Christine's ideas on the Fall of Princes. The Bibell has been called "Lydgatian" but never before analyzed for evidence that Lydgate authored it, because the single manuscript was produced outside his lifetime, but my work has shown that manuscript to be a copy of an earlier original, leaving open the possibility that the translation itself was made much earlier and contemporary with Lydgate.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Cassia Roth's Chapter 8, "Silences and the Corporeal: The Enslaved Body in (Historical) Pain," trains a critical lens on the clinical reports that document medical (gynecological, obstetric) practice in the eighteen hundreds in order to highlight the differential treatment received by Afro-Brazilian women in childbirth, vis-à-vis their Eurodescendant counterparts, and the effect of this treatment on the former. To the extent that physicians disregard the personhood of the enslaved women entrusted to their care, Roth argues, or seem impervious to their pain in their clinical practice, they formalize and authorize the notion of their subhumanity. Roth therefore exhorts fellow researchers today to read between the lines of these medical reports and to practice a "corporeal reading" that might appropriately acknowledge the visceral and imaginary impact of the medi- cal archive and thereby accord these subjects the racial justice historically denied them. Her intervention is a most timely one, given the once-in-a-century pandemic that descended upon us in 2020 and the much commented upon COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among African Americans, given the increasing awareness of past crimes perpetrated against Black bodies in the name of medical science.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this paper, we review the position of the Jarawan languages within the Bantoid group. Based on new evidence (lexical, phonological, and morphological), we rekindle an earlier proposition, postulating that Jarawan languages are not in fact Bantu languages, but rather that they are best classified as BnB languages. The placement of Jarawan languages with the Mbam-Bubi languages in recent classifications, we shall argue, can be explained by shared inheritance. In this paper, we will present our arguments in favor of a reclassification of the Jarawan languages with the BnB, more particularly at the Ekoid or Tivoid level.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay compares two dialogic texts in Mara?hi from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries: the bhakti sant Eknath's Hi?du-Turk Sa?vad [Hindi-Muslim Conversation] and the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens' Discurso sobre a vinda de Jesu Christo [Discourse on the Coming of Jesus Christ], popularly known as the Kris?apura?a. The former text is attributed to a Brahmin who spent much of his life in the heartland of the Mara?hi cultural universe, while the latter was authored by a well-travelled European missionary who wrote the first Christian pura?a from the margins of the Mara?hi cultural universe in Portuguese Goa. By considering the ways in which these roughly coeval texts stage inter-religious dialogue within the Mara?hi literary universe and considering Stephens' work in light of the history of accommodatio, this chapter considers how silence in religious debates may and may not be read as signs of the tolerance of religious difference.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Fluid identities and exchanges between Christians and Hindus have long marked India's coastal South. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, however, all differences were momentarily leveled as waves indiscriminatingly killed more than 8,000 people in Tamil Nadu alone. A close ethnographic account of the immediate responses of local people and religious leaders in the face of this acute loss and suffering bespoke a shared sense of humanity and even erasure of religious and caste difference. Over the fifteen years following the tragedy, however, as church leaders, foreign investors, and politicians tried to make the most of the disaster, a darker picture unfolded. The ocean's killer waves receded only to make room for new tides of money and competition, renewing differences and threatening earlier religious fluidity. The rupture between the Indian and Burmese plates rippled into social ruptures as human need, greed, and tribalism remade the religious and environmental landscape.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For some time, Old Testament text critics have recognized the importance of the G?‘?z (classical Ethiopic) version for textual criticism, especially as a witness to an early Greek text. Nevertheless, most studies have merely mined the version for kernels of Greek evidence, either treating the versional evidence as monolothic or citing G?‘?z variants indiscriminately with little to no discernment of their place in Ethiopian transmission history. Retroversion into Greek, however, can only take place after completing the requisite work of establishing the earliest G?‘?z text, understanding the version's own transmission history, and paying attention to translation technique. Even then, retroversion is methodologically tenuous. We survey here the current knowledge of the G?‘?z Psalter in order to provide a foundation for future work. Despite the limitations, the G?‘?z version offers important testimony to an early Greek form of Psalms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article describes first the work of the THEOT team on 34 manuscripts of Ethiopic Deuteronomy and what we have learned about the various text forms that have developed over the last seven centuries. Based on this work with a large sample, we have been able to identify the collections of distinctive readings that characterize each cluster. Using this list of distinctive readings, Delamarter and Lee developed a set of diagnostic steps for use in identifying the likely cluster membership of any new, unstudied manuscript of Deuteronomy.  They apply their method to an additional 30 manuscripts beyond their initial sample and identify cluster membership for each.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Embodied cognition theorists who argue that cognition is grounded in, or constituted by, bodily and environmental processes face the challenge of explaining why the body and environment are not merely causally, but metaphysically, relevant (Block 2005, Aizawa 2007). This is especially pressing because much of the support for this embodied cognition claim comes from empirical evidence for the causal interrelatedness of bodily, environmental, and neural processes, which at least prima facie could equally support both hypotheses. I provide a novel response to this challenge. I argue that if we are accept the widely adopted thesis of Semantic Externalism -- namely that the contents of our mental states are metaphysically determined by features beyond our brains -- and if we also accept the plausible thesis of Semantic Efficacy -- the thesis that the contents of our mental states are causally relevant to how we think and act -- then we must accept that features beyond our brains make a metaphysical difference to mental processes.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay explores a tension in the Interfaith Center of New York's religious diversity education programs for K-12 teachers, social workers, and police officers.  These programs work to subvert and exceed the limitations of "world religions" pedagogy, while nevertheless meeting the needs of partner organizations and professional audiences who tend to think about religion in such terms—helping these professionals work effectively in the world religions public sphere.  The essay outlines the theoretical frameworks, pedagogic principles, and teaching tactics that have helped the author navigate this tension.  It discusses Michel Foucault's arguments about power and knowledge.  It stresses the importance of teaching about the diversity within all faith traditions, as well as the personal stories and political projects that connect those traditions to people's lives.  It argues that one way to do so is by facilitating panel discussions with diverse religious leaders, and suggests guidelines for structuring such conversations.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A picture book debut by an award-winning author about a boy's life on the U.S.-Mexico border, visiting his favorite places on The Other Side with his father, spending time with family and friends, and sharing in the responsibility of community care.  Early one Saturday morning, a boy prepares for a trip to The Other Side/El Otro Lado. It's close–just down the street from his school–and it's a twin of where he lives. To get there, his father drives their truck along the Rio Grande and over a bridge, where they're greeted by a giant statue of an eagle. Their outings always include a meal at their favorite restaurant, a visit with Tío Mateo at his jewelry store, a cold treat from the paletero, and a pharmacy pickup. On their final and most important stop, they check in with friends seeking asylum and drop off much-needed supplies.  My Two Border Towns by David Bowles, with stunning watercolor illustrations by Erika Meza, is the loving story of a father and son's weekend ritual, a demonstration of community care, and a tribute to the fluidity, complexity, and vibrancy of life on the U.S.-Mexico border.  Available in English and Spanish.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The piece draws attention to the postcolonial history of India.  It assesses how popular attitudes, customs and state policies inhibiting the slaughter of cows and the sale and consumption of beef are or have been a religious question associated with Hindu majoritarian dominance and the accommodation or exclusion of non-Hindus. It also shows how cow protection debates often have arisen in scientific and public policy forums relating to animal husbandry and agriculture. Debates over cow husbandry have had  profound consequences for Indian politics by reifying sectarianism while feeding into a culture of Hindu nationalism and chauvinism that has often targeted Muslims. The chapter shows how Hindu majoritarian dominance has built momentum even as the religious and religious freedom dimension of cow and beef controversies remain ambiguous and contestable.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Our essay addresses the relevance of conscientization in Freire's critical pedagogy to the teaching of race in higher education in the current times. Given that Freire's conscientization was addressed to oppressed groups, we ask: What would conscientization mean for historically oppressive communities in twenty-first century U.S.? How can educators enable this work of conscientization with self-identified white college students in courses that focus on U.S. race relations? We address these questions through our interdisciplinary course, "Race and Identity: Literary and Theological Narratives." We co-developed and taught this course within our disciplinary home departments (English and Theology) in our predominantly white institutions (PWI) in the midwest and the northwest. In our pedagogy, we integrate counterstorytelling with engaged learning strategies. We argue that critical race counterstories need to be paired with a strategic problem-posing learning model to enable the work of conscientization.  Keywords: conscientization/conscientiza?ao, critical race counterstories, problem posing pedagogy, literary studies, religious studies, higher education</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Este artículo demuestra los beneficios que puede aportar el uso de imágenes multiespectrales para el estudio de los mapas históricos a partir por un análisis de su aplicación al estudio del gran mapa del mundo hecho por Henricus Martellus c. 1491, ahora en la Biblioteca Beinecke a la Universidad de Yale. Las imágenes multiespectrales pueden recuperar texto de los manuscritos y mapas dañados por la decoloración, el agua, el fuego, pintura por encima, deterioro, y las arrugas ocasionadas por el paso del tiempo. Ya se sospechaba que el mapa de Martellus de Yale tenía una gran importancia histórica (entre otras cosas por haber servido de modelo a Martin Waldseemüller para la creación de su mapa del mundo de 1507), pero como la mayor parte del texto del mapa se había desvanecido y resultaba ilegible o invisible, era un objeto casi imposible de estudiar. Aquí se expone pares de imágenes –una hecha en la luz natural y la otra multiespectral– para demostrar el éxito del procedimiento.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A world map painted by Henricus Martellus c. 1491 is widely acknowledged to be of great importance in the history of cartography, but has been little studied since it came to the attention of scholars in 1959 because the pigments used to write the descriptive texts and place names has faded or flaked off of the surface. Spectral images of this map collected in August 2014 have been processed by several statistical methods, allowing much of the text to be recovered. The methods may be applied to other documents and for forensic applications.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The poor reputation of Manasses I, archbishop of Reims (c. 1069-1080, deposed by Gregory VII, is well-known. His posthumous memory, orchestrated by Guibert of Nogent and Hugh of Flavigny, is at the origin of the image of the bad bishop, to which historians have generally subscribed. Several publics are possible and detectable in the scandal, which should not imply that this bad reputation existed while the archbishop was alive, when he had both partisans and looked to defend himself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The objective of this work is to measure the action of some Nikkei intellectual journalists who worked in the Japanese-Brazilian press in the early post-war period and, concomitantly, entered other social fields (academic, economic and political) as spokespersons for a group still numerically restricted at the time: the Nikkei intellectual elite of the city of São Paulo. Hideo Onaga, José Yamashiro and Hiroshi Saito are just some of the significant names that emerged during this period and who played a central role in shaping the mentality of the Nikkei community. Thus, we believe that the publications São Paulo Shimbun (Jornal São Paulo 1946-2018) and Paulista Shimbun (Jornal Paulista 1947-1998), idealized by these Nikkei intellectual journalists, stood out in this foray.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The present essay is the first extensive study of Rousseau's theory of knowledge. While Rousseau never published a work on epistemology, his intended reply to Helvétius' "De l'Esprit", inspired by Locke's "Essay Concerning Human Understanding", appears diversely throughout his works, and most notably in his work on education, "Emile". In this fundamental work, so signficant for Kant and the origins of Continental Philosophy, one finds the epistemological grounds of Rousseau's movement from science to aesthetics as comprehensively underlying his thought and thereby his constitutional philosophy.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay examines Leo Strauss' inquiries into the problem of political perception and judgment in relation to the contemporary crisis of constitutional politics, both in practice and in the discipline of political science. Strauss' inquiries into this problem lead him to examine earlier confrontations, notably by Rousseau and Nietzsche, with the difficulties in political perception and judgment as they emerge from Enlightenment constitutionalism. Strauss' inquiries into these problems and their attendant crises lead to a re-examination of ancient constitutional philosophy, notably that of Aristotle's "Politics", from which modernity rebelled. The consequence of Strauss' work leads to a renewed undertanding of the tasks of constitution making as undertaken by the American Founders, and in particular Madison and Hamilton, who explored these issues in both ancient and modern political philosophy. While their work in Founding is now so much placed in question, there remains little understanding, even in the discipline of political science, of the fundamental problems that the Founders confronted and that always need exploring in order to grasp the difficulties at issue. A study of Strauss' wide-ranging, in-depth inquiries on political perception and judgment allows an enriching, deliberative return to the roots of these matters.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The North American Southwest is home to a rich array of petroglyphs commemorating the interests, actions, identities, and histories of the many Native American communities who have lived there for millennia. As symbols, the petroglyphs assume an important dynamic in social processes structuring the cultural identities and collective memories of contemporary tribal communities. For some, petroglyphs are reminders of who they are, from where they have come, what their responsibilities are, and what their relationship was, is, and should be with the land, environment, and their neighbors. At times, those memories are shared among tribal groups, yet in other instances they splinter along cultural or political lines. When that occurs, the petroglyphs can become bound up in contestations over the ownership of place and authenticity of history. Beyond the collective memories of tribes, and generally unaligned with them, is a nationalistic collective memory concerning Native Americans. In this essay I examine the entanglement of petroglyphs, cultural identity, and collective remembering at Tutuveni and Painted Rocks, two of the most renowned petroglyph sites in Arizona. I draw specific attention to the role of the state in an ongoing struggle for authority over cultural history.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Abstract: For Hilbert, mathematics was connected to philosophy by the deepest fibres of its being. He acted on several fronts to keep philosophical concerns alive in mathematical circles and to tear down walls separating the concerns of philosophically-minded mathematicians and mathematically-minded philosophers. This is a contribution to integrating Hilbert's ideas as found in unpublished and published writings into the philosophical discussions where they belong in order to bring important issues back into focus and open new avenues in philosophy, because philosophers are still trying to solve problems that have their roots in problems that have remain unsolved since his time. I study his fight for the philosophers Edmund Husserl and Leonard Nelson. Then I set out what Hilbert called the basic philosophical position and look at his views on theory of knowledge, experience, pure thought, finitism, the axiomatic method, the a priori, the ideal, pre-established harmony, a priori intuition, truth, logical consistency and existence, and his avowed Kantianism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Before digital technology, most of us had access to manuscripts by way of photographic plates and critical editions. Those few who had the privilege of handling the manuscript itself faced their own challenges. Digital technology opens new possibilities for extending and improving the role of manuscripts in our research and teaching. The impact of digitizing manuscripts is unmistakable, but digitizing is not an end in itself. We should think about why we digitize and what we expect a digital simulation of a manuscript to be able to do. In turn, this leads to consideration of how to digitize and what to do with the digital simulation. This essay discusses three priorities I consider most essential when digitizing manuscripts for the benefit of research and teaching in biblical literature. I draw from my experience directing the Jubilees Palimpsest Project, which faced challenges in these areas in the pursuit of the study of the only copy of Jubilees in Latin and the only copy anywhere of the Testament (or Assumption) of Moses. I started off with an interest in recovering more text from the manuscript, which dates from the fifth century and which has been abused to the point of illegibility since that time. As the project progressed, I realized the potential for the digitization of manuscripts to do much more than add to critical editions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the twenty-first century advances in digital technology are propelling the study of ancient literature and scribal culture. This essay describes an integrated set of advances in image capture, processing, and dissemination that improves upon first-hand experience and harnesses the power of the web to connect people and data. Illegible manuscripts are an area of particular interest among all the cultural heritage artifacts that benefit from these advances. Spectral RTI makes it possible to distinguish letters and other evidence of use based on traces as subtle as the corrosion of parchment where ink had once been and the spectral signature of ink stains that cannot be distinguished by the human eye. WebGL and open standards are making it possible to link to interactive enhanced images from anywhere on the web, and to link from the images to annotations and tools for analysis.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Spectral Reflectance Transformation Imaging (Spectral RTI) combines the advantages of Spectral Imaging with the advantages of Reflectance Transformation Imaging into a single consistent data set. For each pixel both color and texture properties are known and can be processed and visualized together. The major advantages gathered from spectral imaging are improved spatial resolution, color resolution, color range beyond the visible spectrum, processing enhancements, and objectively accurate color. The major advantages gathered from RTI are interactivity and enhanced visualization of texture. The combination is greater than the sum of its parts in as much as color and texture information are complementary. For example, even a single letter in an illegible manuscript may have some trace of writing from remaining ink and another trace in the outline of the corrosion into the surface of the parchment where ink had once been. A human user can visualize the information together in a single view for a more complete and natural experience of the manuscript. The consistent combined data also has potential to improve machine learning applied to manuscripts. The cost in time and equipment of Spectral RTI is less than the sum of each. As of 2017, spectral imaging systems can vary from a few thousand to over a hundred thousand dollars, with options for adding RTI of comparable sophistication adding approximately ten percent across the range of cost. There is no cost for the processing software. The cost in time is less than the sum of each because mounting, focus, metadata entry, etc., is done only once for the complete data set. Capture of a single page may take a minute to more than twenty minutes depending on the equipment, resolution, and thoroughness selected.</Abstract>

First, that his pouch—like many others—contained paper as a key constitutive element; and second, that the pouch he used was meant to protect him from bodily violation. Responding to Hortense Spillers's outlining of the intimate relationship between archival writings and markings of violence against the enslaved, the chapter investigates the common incorporation of written papers in mandinga pouches as challenges and reckonings with imperial archives, inquisitorial procedure, and the expectation of enslavement as a condition defined by embodied violence. Providing a series of close analyses of never-before published written papers, drawings, and orations, the chapter first traces how the act of inscribing designs and words with ink onto paper and placing them inside the mandinga pouches emerged in conversation with wider practices of inscription in the African diaspora. Yet the papers also demonstrate how their users strategically re-conceptualized, or took advantage of, fluid relationships between papers, bodies, and textual evocations in order to respond to otherwise contemporary theorizations of the simultaneous "hypervisibility" and "invisibility" of enslaved subjects and the obfuscated legibility of Black histories in the archives of slavery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter investigates the origins of settler colonist fiction that began in the Meiji era and constituted one of the most tangible forms by which modern literature participated in the Empire of Japan's broader expansionist aims. Contrary to the conventional wisdom which takes for granted that this genre was exclusively set in Japan's burgeoning empire in Asia, from 1908 until the onset of World War II settler colonist fiction expressly promoted emigration overseas to sovereign nations in South America as an essential part of its diversified strategy to alleviate the burdens of overpopulation in the home islands. The earliest identifiable work of settler colonist fiction is Horiuchi Shinsen's "South America Bound" (Nanbei yuki), which appeared in the inaugural May 1908 issue of the journal Colonization World (Shokumin sekai), by Tokyo-based magazine publisher Seiko Zasshi Sha.  Although largely forgotten today, both text and genre attest to the pressures confronted by the rural communities marked in Japanese national-imperial discourse as "surplus population" (jinko kajo), including those whose seasonal labor "working away from home" (dekasegi) temporarily brought them into the cities. Enduring for only five issues between May and September 1908, Colonization World nevertheless set in motion production of a lowbrow, but ideologically potent, literary corpus in pro-expansionist and general interest magazines that grew well into the early 1940s. It operated within a feeder system that promised a degree of state sponsorship and oversight, while maintaining the primacy of ambition, skill, and luck in navigating the perils of earning one's fortune abroad.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The article deals with the study of Japanese Brazilian (or Nikkei) art as a dialogic connection between two different and distant spatialities: the country of origin and the country of displacement. The interaction of the relationships developed (GLISSANT, 2021), also considering the interrelation of men and spaces, (KAUFFMAN, 2004), is always procedural. The reflection on Orientalism is developed in dialogue with the lives and works of six Japanese Brazilian women artists: Tomie Ohtake (1913-2015) and Alina Okinaka (1920-1991), both pre-war immigrants; Sachiko Koshikoku (1937-2019) and Shoko Suzuki (1929- ), post-war immigrants; and Erica Kaminishi (1979- ) and Yukie Hori (1979- ), who are Japanese descendants born and raised in Brazil.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Using the examples of the chanted offices composed for the patron saints worshipped in Ghent, Bavo, Landoald, and Livinus, as compared with offices for patron saints worshipped in Cambrai, Gaugericus and Maxellendis, all composed before 1200, I explore the tonality of their chant and then the possibility that the choice of neumes could be a marker of their compositional style. Longer neumes are especially revealing. My paper raises the question of the relative meaning of pitch and neume for the analysis of early medieval offices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article explains how musical life in Ghent changed after the monks of St. Bavo's Abbey were moved to the church of St. John in Ghent to become a chapter of canons in the decades prior to 1559, when St. John's church was renamed St. Bavo's cathedral. Using my archival research and published scholarship, I describe music before and after, and emphasize the dramatic increase in the performance of choral polyphony after this 'migration' of the monks.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Maps are amalgams of words and images, of history, myth, and religion, fart and science--and as such, they highlight the arbitrary divisions we have created between modern disciplines that have little or no relevance to the study of medieval artifacts. Maps therefore can be of great use in courses across many disciplines. Two of us have been using old maps in our teaching for many years and have found that they provoke some of the richest class discussions each semester. Maps are gripping, consuming things; they draw us in, orient us in space and time, invite us to explore their extents, and create whole worlds anew."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This article explores the spiritual underpinnings of the forms used in Islam- icate world maps. After a brief overview on the ‘Kit&amp;#x00;b al-mas&amp;#x00;lik wa-al-mam&amp;#x00;lik' (‘Book of routes and realms' – abbreviated to KMMS) Islamicate mapping tradition, it examines the meaning behind the form of a bird that constitutes the shape of the landmasses of the old world. In Islamic culture the bird is an oft-repeated motif with a multitude of meanings related to the bird's reflection of soul and its ability to be closer to the heavens and God. Through an examination of the bird in the world map this article points to the multitude of Islamic cultural, philosophical, and spiri- tual signs embedded in Islamicate cartography.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Revisita a produção recente no campo da história social brasileira a  partir  de  uma  indagação  sobre  os  direitos  das  mulheres  durante  o  longo  período em que vigoraram as constituições liberais de 1824 e de 1891. Nenhuma das  duas  cartas  magnas  fez  qualquer  menção  às  mulheres;  ambas  garantiram  os  fundamentos de uma ordem familiar patriarcal. Sob a vigência das duas ordens cons-titucionais,  o  silêncio  sobre  as  mulheres  produziu  distintas  desigualdades  jurídicas  ao  longo  de  dois  séculos.  Mas  essa  não  foi  uma  história  linear  marcada  exclusiva-mente  por  silêncios  e  exclusões.  Os  termos  do  direito  constitucional  incidiram  em  disputas por direitos e garantias que excederam amplamente as intenções dos legis-ladores e dos agentes judiciais. O conjunto da produção no campo da história social ao longo dos últimos 30 anos sobre esse extenso período, mesmo nos casos em que não  assumiu  uma  perspectiva  de  gênero  explícita,  torna-se  um  excelente  guia  para  acompanhar  as  demandas  e  negociações  por  direitos  de  diferentes  grupos  sociais  atravessados pelo gênero.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Translation is a two-way street. Or so the maps that I harness for the purposes of this chapter intimate: one a medieval European T-O map labeled in Arabic and the other a medieval Islamic geographical atlas made in Norman Sicily. One was interpreted by a famous eleventh-century Andalusi Muslim geographical scholar of Arab descent and the other illustrated by a Siculo-Arab cartographic artist may have had an influence on the childhood psyche of the emperor, Frederick II, who went on to be called Stupor Mundi (Wonder of the world). One ended up influencing the composition of an Arabic geographical text and the other had an impact on a segment of the Kitab al-masalik wa-al-mamalik (Book of routes and realms) KMMS Islamic mapping tradition. Each speaks to crucial sides of translation: interpretation, intention, and impact. These are the sides that I focus on in this chapter.  This analysis provides us with an opportunity to explore the question of Islamo-Christian cartographic connections. Did medieval European maps influence the Islamic ones or vice versa? Or were they mutually exclusive? It is one of the major unresolved debates in the history of cartog raphy. Scholars fall on both sides of the divide. A definitive answer to the question has been hampered by the lack of extant examples demonstrating Islamo-Christian cartographic connections. A decade ago a medieval European T-O map labeled in Arabic came back into the limelight after a forty- year hiatus and recently I identified a KMMS geographic atlas as having been produced in the late twelfth century Norman court of Sicily. Taken together these new identifications make it possible to update the discourse on the question of Islamo-Christian cartographic connections."</Abstract>

“The editors of this volume have embarked on a very novel approach to one of the most fascinating periods of human history, 1000–1800 CE. By bringing together profound research on diverse topics that cross cultures, languages, and systems of faith in the Euro-Asian region—and by framing the history of science within the scope of global history—Knowledge in Translation succeeds in abolishing borders of all kinds” by George Saliba, Columbia University 

“Knowledge in Translation is a remarkable collection of essays that highlights the multidirectional and polycentric nature of the transfer of scientific knowledge around the globe, with an expansive chronology that incorporates medieval as well as early modern exchanges across communities. This book thus examines knowledge and practices that crossed boundaries, and does so itself.”

		<Abstract>"Contrary to the impression that one receives from traditional histories of cartography, the richest heritage of pre-Renaissance maps has come down through history from the medieval Islamic world rather than ancient Greece or medieval Europe. Muslim carto-geographical scholars from the tenth century CE onward drew on Greek, Babylonian, Coptic, Syriac, Sassanian, Indian, Chinese, and Turkic knowledge to produce a new genre of detailed maps of the known world. There are hundreds of medieval Islamic maps in oriental manuscript collections worldwide, many of them unpublished. Until recently these maps lay virtually untouched, often deliberately ignored on the grounds that they are not mimetically accurate representations of the world. This perspective overlooks the great value of these images as representations of the way medieval Muslims perceived their world. The abundance of extant copies produced in locales across the Islamic world for eight centuries testifies to the enduring importance of these maps. Because all images are socially constructed these iconic carto-ideographs contain valuable information about the milieus in which they were produced. They are a rich source of historical data that can be used as alternate gateways into the past."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter explores the legacy of the patriarchal family structures that were central to Brazilian slavery by exploring the stories of two filhos de criação who brought paternity suits against their natal families in early twentieth-century Brazil. Each was born to an enslaved mother and raised in his alleged white father's household at the end of the nineteenth century. Their experiences offer rare insight into the internal dynamics of a particular extended family structure that emerged from plantation slavery, in which lower-status filhos de criação were raised to occupy a variety of differentiated social positions within hierarchical extended families. These children seldom moved into the class status of their "legitimate" relatives but instead often maintained life-long, unequal relationships that combined different measures of love, affection, dependence, servitude, and resentment. Their stories reveal continuing uncertainty over how to define and enforce paternal responsibility and family membership in the aftermath of slavery.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Munda languages have undergone contact-driven changes in their structure at multiple times during their history in South Asia, not just a single parametric shift in rhythm subsequently triggering a cascading typological restructuring as has been previously claimed. Moreover, some changes are pattern copies or calques and others are form copies or borrowings. Some changes found in Munda languages from their original state occurred very early at the proto-Munda stage, and are reflected in the structure of all attested modern Munda languages, e.g. the shift to SOV syntax. What language(s) proto-Munda may have been in contact with at this time is unknown. Other shifts reflect very clear later restructuring such as the reorganization of the verb template in proto-Gutob-Remo, and likely reflects a pattern copy of a Dravidian structure. Still other pattern copies are quite recent, such as the shift to subject marking on preverbal negators in Kharia that likely occurred under influence from Mundari. Form copies in morphosyntax are also found in various Munda languages, such as the borrowing of an objective case marker of likely Indo-Aryan origin attested in several languages, but each one separately and individually reflecting a distinct source language and contact milieu.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Munda languages show complex systems of negative polarity items interacting with argument indices, tense-aspect-mood (TAM) markers and indices of transitivity, voice and valence. Two formal series of negation are found across the Kherwarian subgroup, one a general negator, one encoding prohibitive. Both the default negator and the prohibitive appear before the verbal complex in attested Kherwarian languages, and both typically serve as the host for subject clitics, but there is micro-variation noted among Kherwarian languages in the indexing of verbal actants that are dependent on both TAM marking and negation. One such oddity is that actant encoding is more likely in negative formations than in positive ones such as with animate non-human or inanimate subjects. Certain other typologically unusual features characterize the modern systems (as well as indeed proto-Kherwarian in some instances), in particular a mismatch between the encoding of possessa as subjects in negative past copula forms but as objects in negative present ones.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Indian national and local state policies of ‘development' have had profound linguistic, sociocultural and demographic effects on so-called ‘primitive tribal' communities, who occupy the very lowest rung in the complex social hierarchy that defines the post-independence modern Indian nation-state. Popular belief expressed by the majority dominant Hindu and Indo-Aryan population asserts the advance of a ‘postcolonial' contemporary India. Certain ‘primitive tribal' communities in no sense share in the postcolonial experience, and indeed have suffered in many ways more under the internal neo-colonialist development schemes enforced on them by the ‘postcolonial' Indian state regime than anything during the time of the British Raj. State efforts at 'development' for 'particularly vulnerable tribal' groups' is an orchestrated move by State agencies to i) Hindu-ize their population religiously and socially, ii) force foreign agricultural and animal husbandry practices on them economically, iii) destroy their traditional livelihood opportunities and iv) Aryanize them linguistically. We discuss here the concepts of 'tribal' in modern India with respect to two ‘primitive (or particularly vulnerable) tribal' language communities belonging to the Munda (Austroasiatic) language family, Birho? and Gta? and how their own understanding of the goals that 'development' efforts perpetrated by internal neocolonialist State agent have made i)-iv) approaching realities and how these efforts might still be averted.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Assam Santali shows a system of second syllable prominence regardless of the syllabic shape in non-derived and uninflected disyllabic words. Prominence is cued by a conspiracy of duration, intensity and fundamental frequency. This system of prominence assignment in Assam Santali disyllables is true regardless of the utterance context: whether the word in pronounced in isolation, in a quasi-focal position in a phrasal/sentence frame or in an explicitly out-of-focus sentential frame. While the syllable structure plays no role in determining that the second syllable is treated as prominent with respect to the first syllable in our data set, the specific segmental environment appears to have limited interaction. Duration is the most consistent cue of prominence in our data and appears to be exceptionless in this function in all instances, regardless of syllable structure, the utterance context or the segmental environment. Intensity is largely the same but shows some limited differences with words containing only high vowels and with certain onset consonants. Fundamental frequency does not appear to cue words in when uttered in isolation, and also shows limited effect of fricative and affricate onset consonants but shows no sensitivity to syllable structure.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The marker -har- is an element in the Munda language Gta? (Gta?sa) that previously has been considered a third plural subject marker, but its distributional range and functions suggest that it shiould rather be analyzed as a pluractional marker. The pluractional in Gta? can occur in all of the typical subject contexts associated with pluractionals cross-linguistically, in Chadic languages like Bole (Gimba 2000, 2001): that is, several subjects acting one by one, several subject acting iteratively on the same object, subject subjects acting iteratively on several objects, one subject acting on several objects, one subject repeatedly doing the same action. However, some features of Gta? pluractional marking are more noteworthy from a typological perspective.  Thus, the pluractional marker in Gta? is affixal but not obligatory as such insofar as it does not always occur when one might expect it and speakers will accept sentences without it as grammatical; it occurs in its own templatic slot in the verb template after the Aspect and Aktionsart categories and before the finite/non-finite mood marker; it can occur with numerals; it can occur with plural and dual marked subjects NPs; it occurs with verbs of motion commonly; it occurs with  verbs of speaking and mental action most commonly; it often occurs at the end and beginning of narratives; it can occur sentence initially in a non-finite forms in tail-head linkage structures; it can occur with serialized verbs; and it is used in combination with ‘live' as a conventionalized story ending.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Striking similarities in Etruscan and Anatolian material culture reveal various forms of contact and exchange between these regions on opposite sides of the Mediterranean. This is the first comprehensive investigation of these connections, approaching both cultures as agents of artistic exchange rather than as side characters in a Greek-focused narrative. It synthesizes a wide range of material evidence from c. 800 – 300 BCE, from tomb architecture and furniture to painted vases, terracotta reliefs, and magic amulets. By identifying shared practices, common visual language, and movements of objects and artisans (from both east to west and west to east), it illuminates many varied threads of the interconnected ancient Mediterranean fabric.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The story of daily life in Istanbul may be told, in part, by objects. This chapter takes as its main themes the circulation and consumption of arts and crafts, the spread of styles, and notions of decorum and hierarchy as expressed in everyday household goods in the early modern city between about 1550 and 1750. The first section discusses some of the city's markets, the main avenues by which art, objects, and commodities moved between artisan and household, and between households. The second section provides a brief survey of Ottoman writing about crafts and craftspeople, and about objects. Sources reveal abiding preoccupations: abundance, quality, and suitability. These notions influenced discussions of objects, and on attitudes toward their makers, buyers, and sellers. The third and last section looks at domestic goods and makes some preliminary suggestions about how confession might interact with crafts and, in one case, with the art found in the city's residences.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter surveys the context and circumstances for the creation of five frontispieces in the Royal Society's first three decades (1660-1690). These images are useful sites of investigation for examining the relationship between text and image in the Society's early printing program. These five frontispieces each have a different maker and different message, but all were approved and sanctioned for publication by the Royal Society. In publishing books with frontispiece images, the Royal Society began disseminating visual statements to a wider public – about the Society's authority, goals, and stature.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This chapter examines the history of human-machine assemblages used to speak for the dead, comparing the practices of the nineteenth-century American Spiritualist movement with those of present-day transhumanist mind-uploading. In both cases, forms of mediated communication give the dead a continuing voice in society through a participatory performance involving the medium—a person whose consciousness is suspended in a state of trance, or a set of algorithms—the deceased, and an audience. Mediumship becomes a theater in which audiences both desire and interrogate the capabilities of necro-communication technology. The chapter attends to these technologies' implied models of selfhood, which disaggregate mental content—software—from the vehicle of its expression—hardware—in the tradition of Cartesian dualism. The chapter argues that the technologies in question inevitably structure, in concerning ways, political notions of possessive individualism, which become commoditized in the shift from human-performed mediumship to selfhood instantiated in proprietary software products.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Die Jahrhundertwende um 1600 gilt in der Musikgeschichte im Allgemeinen als Zeit des asthetischen Umbruchs. Der 400. Todestag des Wolfenbutteler Hofkapellmeisters Michael Praetorius (1571-1621) bietet den Anlass, neue Schlaglichter auf einen Akteur dieses Umbruchs zu werfen. Als Komponist, Schriftsteller und Organisator des musikalischen Lebens hat Praetorius die entscheidenden, vor allem aus Norditalien kommenden Innovationen der Musik zeitgleich aufgegriffen, kompositorisch angewendet und den Musikschaffenden seiner Zeit publizistisch vermittelt. Die in diesem Band versammelten Studien konturieren die epochale Rolle von Praetorius in den asthetischen, epistemischen und soziologischen Kontexten seiner Zeit. Sie widmen sich im Einzelnen daher dem konfessionellen Wandel und den spathumanistischen Praktiken der Gelehrsamkeit, die ihre Wirkung sowohl im Werk von Praetorius als auch in dessen Rezeption entfalten, wie auch den politischen und musikalischen Netzwerken als Arbeitsstrategie des fruhneuzeitlichen Musikers. In mehreren Detailstudien werden diverse auffuhrungspraktische Probleme untersucht sowie die Beitrage des Hofkapellmeisters zu musikasthetischen Entwicklungen und Klangarchitekturen gewurdigt.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A web of diverse circumstances has led to the outbreak of the Flanders War, which started during the last decade of the sixteenth century and ended with the independence of Holland in 1659. This fight of the Low Countries against the Spanish monarchy in the European continent was closely linked to the presence of the Dutch in the Pacific. Based on four news pamphlets about the naval conflicts between the Spaniards and Dutch during the period of the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621), this article studies the manner in which the texts represent Dutch expansion in Asia. It also explores these texts' contribution to the existent system of the political-religious discourse.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Seafaring activity for trade and travel was dominant throughout the Spanish Empire, and in the worldview and imagination of its inhabitants, the specter of shipwreck loomed large. Shipwreck in the Early Modern Hispanic World probes this preoccupation by examining portrayals of nautical disasters in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish literature and culture. The essays collected here showcase shipwreck's symbolic deployment to question colonial expansion and transoceanic trade; to critique the Christian enterprise overseas; to signal the collapse of dominant social order; and to relay moral messages and represent socio-political debates. The contributors find examples in poetry, theater, narrative fiction, and other print artifacts, and approach the topic variously through the lens of historical, literary, and cultural studies. Ultimately demonstrating how shipwrecks both shaped and destabilized perceptions of the Spanish Empire worldwide, this analytically rich volume is the first in Hispanic studies to investigate the darker side of mercantile and imperial expansion through maritime disaster.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The contributors in Ethnographic Refusals, Unruly Latinidades highlight the value of "radical inclusion" in their research and call for a critical self-reflexivity that marshals the power of bearing witness to move from rhetoric to praxis in support of these methodologies within anthropological perspectives. The essays in this collection do not offer simple solutions to histories of colonialism, patriarchy, and misogyny through which gender binaries and racial hierarches have been imposed and reproduced, but rather provide a crucial opportunity for reflection on and continued reimagination of the contours of Latinidad. These scholars deploy Latinx strategically as part of ongoing dialogues, understanding that their terminologies are inherently imprecise, contested, and constantly shifting. Each chapter explores how Latinx ethnographers and interlocutors work together in contexts of refusal--ever mindful of how power shapes these encounters and the analyses that emerge from them--as well as the extraordinary possibilities offered by ethnography and its role in ongoing social transformation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Music, Sound, and Documentary Film in the Global South, edited by Christopher L. Ballengee, represents an important step toward thinking about the production and analysis of the soundscapes of documentary film, all while exploring a range of social, cultural, technological, and theoretical questions relevant to current trends in Global South studies. Written by a diverse set of authors, including filmmakers, academics, and cultural critics, the ten essays in this book provide fresh evaluations of the place of music and sound in documentary films outside the European-American milieu. On the whole, the authors illuminate how the invention of documentary film was at first a product of the colonialist project. Yet over time, access to filmmaking technologies led to the creation of documentary films relevant for local communities and national identities. In this sense, documentary film in the Global South might be broadly defined as a mode of personally or politically mediated storytelling that, by one route or another, has become a useful and recognizable means of memorializing traumatic histories and critiquing everyday lived experience. As the essays in this volume attest, close readings of documentary soundscapes provide fresh perspectives on ways of hearing and ways of being heard in the Global South.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Stones and stone masters are an important focus of animist religious practice in Southeast Asia. Recent studies on animism see animist rituals not as a mere metaphor for community or shared values, but as a way of forming and maintaining relationships with occult presences. This book features city pillars, statues, megaliths, termite mounds, mountains, rocks found in forests, and stones that have been moved to shrines, as well as the territorial cults which can form around them. The contributors extend and deepen the recent literature on animism to form a new analytical perspective on these cults across mainland Southeast Asia. Not just a collection of exemplary ethnographies, Stone Masters is also a deeply comparative volume that develops its ideas through a meshwork of regional entanglements, parallels, and differences, before entering into a dialogue with debates on power, mastery, and the social theory of animism globally.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Human-fashioned boundaries transform spaces by introducing dualisms, bifurcations, creative symbioses, contradictions, and notions of inclusion and exclusion. The Buddhist boundaries considered in this book, simas—a term found in South and Southeast Asian languages and later translated into East Asian languages—come in various shapes and sizes and can be established on land or in bodies of water. Sometimes, the word sima refers not only to a ceremonial boundary, but the space enclosed by the boundary, or even the markers (when they are used) that denote the boundary.  Simas were established early on as places where core legal acts (kamma), including ordination, of the monastic community (sangha) took place according to their disciplinary codes. Simas continue to be deployed in the creation of monastic lineages and to function in diverse ways for monastics and non-monastics alike. As foundations of Buddhist religion, simas are used to sustain, revitalize, or reform Buddhist practices, notions of identity, and conceptualizations of time and history. In the last few decades, scholarly awareness of and expertise on simas has developed to a point where a volume like this one, which examines simas across numerous cultural contexts and scholarly fields of inquiry, is both possible and needed. Sima traditions expressed in the Theravada cultures of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka constitute the dominant focus of the work; a chapter on East Asia raises questions of historical transmission beyond these areas. Throughout contributors engage texts; history; archaeology; politics; art; ecology; economics; epigraphy; legal categories; mythic narratives; understandings of the cosmos; and conceptualizations of compassion, authority, and violence.</Abstract>

The goal of this chapter was to reevaluate and appreciate Lou Andreas-Salomé as a philosopher in her own right. It offers a detailed analysis of her original philosophy of life and its application within her feminist theory, by exploring its main features, clarifying the major influences on her position (especially the Nietzschean and Spinozist elements) and discussing it in the context of contemporary accounts of life in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century (Dilthey, Simmel, and Bergson). Section One explores, in her work "The God" and related texts, her critique of religious experience and Enlightenment thought, and her positive account of life and the "faith in life," highlighting specifically the Spinozist and Nietzschean influences on her position. Section Two focuses on her feminist writings, especially "The Human Being as a Woman", and examines how her philosophy of life plays out in her gender theory, according to which women are understood to live and develop according to a female life-form.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To appear in Spinoza in Germany: Political and Religious Thought across the Long Nineteenth Century, edited by Jason M. Yonover and Kristin Gjesdal, Oxford University Press.  This chapter explores the influence of Spinoza's philosophy both on Salomé's early philosophy of life, before her encounter with psychoanalysis, and on her later work in psychoanalysis. It highlights how the Spinozistic elements of her thought mark a continuity throughout her work, despite shifts in terminology.  More broadly, Salomé's Spinozism could even be seen as a connecting link between the two movements to which she was closest, namely Lebensphilosophie and psychoanalysis.  After a brief biographical sketch of her early encounter with Spinoza's philosophy and her later turn to psychoanalysis in Section One, Section Two of the chapter examines three Spinozistic themes in Salomé's thought: first her conception of the primordial ground (Urgrund) of life as the all-unity (All-Einheit), which is compared with Spinoza's divine substance and the psychoanalytic concept of the Unconscious (2.1 and 2.2); second her psycho-somatic parallelism as two ways of representing life, which can be seen as building upon Spinoza's account of mind and body (2.3); and third her account of the ethical dimension of human life, which has echoes of Spinoza's theory of the affects and perfection (2.4). Salomé brings these three Spinozistic elements to bear in different areas of her work, such as in her accounts of God and religion, of eroticism and sexuality, of women and gender, and of human creativity and artistic productivity. Her most original contribution to the philosophical foundations of psychoanalysis is to replace Freud's dualism on several levels with monism in the Spinozist sense, leading her to an original account of human self-development based on the assumption of a non-pathological primary narcissism and the parallelism of mind and body.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We argue that honors colleges can deploy the power of the liberal arts to emphasize diversity, equity, global citizenship, ethical leadership, and empowerment by combining liberal arts and STEM fields in interdisciplinary approaches to global challenges, from climate change to the pandemic and forced displacement. As the honors colleges at Texas Tech and Boston University work to be at the forefront of pedagogical and curricular innovation, the 21st century has presented us with a student and faculty community becoming increasingly aware of historical, racial, gendered, and socioeconomic disparities, which were further exacerbated by a pandemic. In response to these issues, we have changed how we approach the liberal arts, shifting from a traditional "Great Books" curriculum to an interdisciplinary focus that immerses students in an environment that fully integrates STEM with the humanities. With this approach, students learn how STEM and the humanities are linked, mutually dependent and how they continually affect our world and society. Our pedagogical innovation includes experiential learning, team-taught courses, first-year and summit experiences, non-traditional coursework, study abroad opportunities, and co-curricular programs. The overall effect has been the production of reflective and empowered students and graduates willing and ready to use the new liberal arts to attack the grand challenges of our society.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The chapter studies the settlers of the aqueous terrain of the drainage basins of the Brahmaputra and the Ganga debouching into the Bay of Bengal and charts the deep ecology of the delta as a shifting and volatile geo-historical formation. Traditional settlers of this land such as the Kaibartas and Bagdis are some of the largest coastal caste groups of India, who still appear in the census with their subcaste status tied to their work as fisherfolk and guardians of  levees and dykes. The chapter is a foray into the histories and lifeworld of people that colonial anthropologists once called the Dravidian "boat castes" and the "aboriginal" tribes of coastal Bengal as amphibious, subaltern figures, who are now the precariat of climate change and ocean rise</Abstract>

		<Abstract>[This chapter begins with a brief review of the literature concerning ceremonial landscapes in the Chesapeake, including stone landscapes along the Potomac, Rappahannock, James, and York Rivers and at the head of Chesapeake Bay. The second section describes how GIS technology was used to model known ceremonial landscapes in the Rappahannock River valley in Virginia, in an effort to predict or identify ceremonial places that may no longer survive in the above-ground landscape. These models affirm Indigenous accounts that ceremonial landscapes were positioned in the landscape so that they were never very far from the landscape of everyday life, indicating that Western concepts, such as the division between ceremonial and the mundane, do not necessarily capture or represent Indigenous ways of understanding the world. The final section offers observations on the construction—and deconstruction—of Native memory in the landscape and how settler colonialism continues to impact efforts to understand Native landscapes in the Chesapeake Tidewater and elsewhere.]</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Both archaeological evidence and tribal oral history indicate that Colonoware in the Rappahannock River valley originated in late seventeenth-century Indigenous settlements catering to English traders and explorers. These early colonowares appear to have been made principally by Indigenous potters or potters trained in Indigenous techniques through the eighteenth century. Colonoware provides evidence about the persistence and mobility of Indigenous communities in the river valley who are otherwise virtually absent from the documents. Colonoware is also a proxy measure for the interactions of the river valley's settler communities with free Rappahannocks who, for a number of reasons, preferred to avoid White society after 1705. Colonoware may also provide insight into the experiences of Indigenous from places beyond the Rappahannock River valley but who found themselves enslaved on the river valley's plantations. Indigenous potters may have shared knowledge of clay and temper sources and locally-specific pottery-making skills with other enslaved people, including those of African descent.</Abstract>
