		<Abstract>A two-part series about one of America's most influential and controversial founding fathers — Alexander Hamilton: self-made man, war hero, statesman, financial visionary and political lightning rod.  Hamilton was a leading force behind the Constitution, the architect of a modern economy in America, champion of a strong central government and effective military, and leader of one of the country's first political parties.  Yet today, Hamilton and his accomplishments are neither widely understood nor appreciated.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A 90-minute portrait of the woman who transformed the previously undefined role of the President's wife and became America's "first" First Lady. Dolley Madison lived through two wars, knew the first twelve Presidents, and watched America evolve from a struggling young republic to the first modern democracy in the world. At a time when women could neither vote nor participate officially in politics, Dolley Madison, wife of the fourth President, James Madison, became one of the most influential and best loved figures of her day. When she died in 1849 at the age of 81 -  one of the last remaining members of the founding generation - Washington City honored her with the largest state funeral the capital had ever seen. , Dolley Madison is a 90-minute PBS prime-time special that will re-introduce Americans to this charismatic First Lady, examining her role as one of the most influential American women of the early nineteenth century. Viewers will learn how Dolley Madison used her skills as the nation's first great political hostess to create a distinctly American political style—one that embodied the new country's republican values. The documentary will also explore how Dolley became a unifying symbol for the country and helped Americans create a national identity. </Abstract>

		<Abstract>Freedom Riders is the powerful, harrowing and ultimately inspirational story of six months in 1961 that changed America forever. From May to November 1961, more than 400 black and white Americans risked their lives—and often endured savage beatings and imprisonment—for simply traveling together on buses and trains as they journeyed through the Deep South., This inspirational documentary is about a band of courageous civil-rights activists calling themselves the Freedom Riders. Gaining impressive access to influential figures on both sides of the issue, it chronicles a chapter of American history that stands as an astonishing testament to the accomplishment of youth and what can result from the incredible combination of personal conviction and the courage to organize against all odds.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Egyptian Oracle performance is a live reenactment of an authentic public ceremony from ancient Egypt's Late Period. We project our Virtual Egyptian Temple on the wall at life scale extending the physical theater into virtual space. The temple is not a film, not a static image, but a true three-dimensional space, which the audience navigates during scene changes. The central actor is a high priest, an avatar controlled by a live human puppeteer, hidden offstage. The supporting actress stands in front of the screen, in costume, mediating the experience. Audience members represent the Egyptian populace acting out brief roles in the drama. Finally, the sacred boat (left) is another puppet also controlled by the puppeteer. In the drama, the will of the temple god moves the boat.  This production is a prototype funded by a Digital Startup Grant from the NEH (HD-5120910). We are not seeking support for a full implementation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This video series is part of the Artists Picture Changing American Landscapes teacher professional development workshop conducted by the Rivers Institute at Hanover College (http://rivers.hanover.edu). From the 28 landscape sketches by British officers in the Scenographia Americana (1768) to Albert Bierstadt's Looking Down Yosemite Valley, California (1864) or, even later, Charles Sheeler's American Landscape (1930), art has shaped public perceptions of the vast North American continent. In turn, the landscape leaves its imprint upon artists. The Artists Picture Changing American Landscapes teacher workshop (http://www.apcal.net/home.php) can help teachers integrate Picturing America landscapes into the core subjects of fine arts, American history and government, social studies, and English/language arts, employing images, primary, and secondary documents in their classrooms to see how artists have responded to changing American landscapes — physical, social, and political.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Incorporate the Picturing America collection into your humanities, history, social studies, visual arts, or language arts classroom.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Full-length downloadable audio versions of these lectures are available at the website.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The workshop is made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations in this video do not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>When the Balkans exploded into war in the 1990s, reports that tens of thousands of women were being systematically raped as a tactic of ethnic cleansing captured the international spotlight. I Came to Testify tells how sixteen women who had been imprisoned by Serb-led forces in the Bosnian town of Foca broke history's great silence and took the witness stand in an international court of law.  Their courage resulted in a triumphant verdict that led to new international laws about sexual violence in war.  Narrated by Matt Damon, the film is the first hour in the five-part documentary series Women, War &amp;amp; Peace that aired on PBS in 2011.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Weiqi, often referred to as "Go" in English, is arguably the most important game in East Asia, with an estimated thirty million to fifty million players throughout the world. Weiqi is a board game immersed in more vivid and often contradictory cultural metaphors than any other game in the world. As Chinese politics have changed over the last two millennia, so too has the imagery of the game—from a tool to seek religious enlightenment to military metaphors, one of the noble four arts, one of the condemned "four olds", nationalism, transnationalism, historical elitism, and futuristic hyper rationality.&amp;#x0D; The filmmaker interviews people in China in settings ranging from children's schools to China's elite Beijing University to a park where retired working class men gather to play, from child educators to those reminiscing about their own youth during the Cultural Revolution. What emerges is a fascinating cultural study as people discuss children's education, retirement, China forty years ago and today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The husband and wife team of Charles and Ray Eames are widely regarded as America's most important designers. Perhaps best remembered for their mid-century plywood and fiberglass furniture, the Eames Office also created a mind-bending variety of other products, from splints for wounded military during World War II, to photography, interiors, multi-media exhibits, graphics, games, films and toys. But their personal lives and influence of significant events in American life – from the development of modernism, to the rise of the computer age – has been less widely understood. Narrated by James Franco, EAMES: The Architect and the Painter is the first film since their death dedicated to these creative geniuses and their work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>China is the most populous nation in the world, the second largest economy, and one of the two largest trading partners of the United States. And yet a large percentage of the American people view China's rise as a threat to the U.S., either militarily or economically or both. According to a recent CNN/Opinion Research survey, 71 percent of American consider China an economic threat to the U.S., while 51 percent consider China a military threat.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; The frequent reports in the American media about human rights abuses in China add to a rather dark view of that country on the part of the American public. When surveyed, 68 percent of Americans suggest that China is doing a bad job respecting the human rights of its citizens.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; Larry and Qin Herzberg, both professors of Chinese language and culture at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, MI spent several summers interviewing people from different walks of life across the U.S. as to their views on China. To answer their concerns as well as those voiced in the media, they interviewed professors of Chinese history, religion, philosophy, and business, who have spent the last three decades or more studying China and traveling there regularly. &amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; They also interviewed a Canadian reporter, an American missionary, and a New Zealander restaurant manager who have lived in China for many years. Included in the video are also interviews with two American businessmen who oversee factories in China.&amp;#x0D; These people with a true knowledge of China were asked to comment on the negative feelings and fears so many Americans have about China. In particular, they were asked to answer these three basic questions: Is China an economic threat to the U.S.? Is it a military threat? Exactly now widespread are human rights abuses in China, especially as regards religious freedom?&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; This film is designed to give Americans and other Westerners a better and more nuanced understanding of the rising superpower in the world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>A racially charged criminal trial and a heart-rending love story converge in this documentary about Mildred and Richard Loving, a part-black, part-Indian woman and a white man who married in Jim Crow era Virginia. Thrown into rat-infested jails and exiled from their hometown for many years, the Lovings fought back and changed history. They were paired with two young and ambitious lawyers who were driven to pave the way for social justice and equal rights through a historic Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia. The Loving Story takes us on a journey into the heart of race relations in America. But, in the end, it is a poignant love story of two people who simply wanted to live in the place they called home.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Anthropologists have noted that traditional lifeways in the Middle East, especially those related to diet, are rapidly disappearing. Women were the primary bread bakers in traditional Middle Eastern societies until the emergence of male owned and operated commercial bakeries in the mid 20th century. Although their participation in bread baking is now limited, women are still strongly associated with the production of this essential foodstuff in Jordan. This documentary examines women's changing roles in bread production in contemporary Jordan through interviews with urban and rural Jordanians in the northern Jordan Valley, Amman, and the Petra area.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Turkey's application to enter the EU has required the country to learn new things about itself. It is required to learn them in specific frameworks, using specific concepts and methodologies, and these are subsumed in EU entry negotiations under the rubric of statistics.  Having collected these statistics, it is required to share them with its population and the EU, and—crucially—it continually reforms its institutions and practices in light of the new statistical knowledge.  This paper argues that the relationship between statistics and social forms is not solely one of "description."  To the extent that statistics do not merely study or represent the objects they are purported to be about, but are intimately involved in intervening in/on those objects (e.g. social, economic, or ecological processes) and in fact in remaking them through ‘reform' and/or ‘development,' they have a performative nature.  In this sense statistics are less a methodology and more a technology--a technology of governance. The paper draws on fieldwork in Turkey with statisticians, technicians and agricultural experts working on the design and implementation of EU-inspired reforms to develop new apparatuses for the collection of data on agriculture in the country.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Michael Vorenberg talked about the legacy of Confederate Captain Henry Wirz, who was in charge of the Andersonville Prison Camp from March 1864 to his arrest in May 1865 for war crimes. Professor Vorenberg argued that Mr. Wirz's trial was framed within the context of slavery but the memory of his trial and execution has changed as historians view it through the lens of 20th century events.  "Judgment at Washington: Lew Wallace, Henry Wirz, and the Elusive Quest to End the Civil War" was part of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society 2014 Spring Conference "A Just and Lasting Peace: Ending the Civil War", held in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. It was the eleventh symposium in the series, "The National Capitol in a Nation Divided: Congress and the District of Columbia Confront Sectionalism and Slavery."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Hypertext: an Educational Experiment in English and Computer Science at Brown University is a documentary film from 1976 made by Brown University computer scientist Andries "Andy" van Dam. The film was funded by a 1974 grant provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities to support "an experimental program to teach a college-level English poetry course, utilizing a new form of computer based 'manuscript,' called a hypertext."  The Hypertext system used in the film is called FRESS and was developed by Andy van Dam, Carol Chomsky, Richard Harrington, and others based on the hypertext idea developed by Theodor Nelson.  The Hypertext poetry class described in the film was conducted by Jim Catano, Carol Chomsky, Nancy Comley, and Robert Scholes.  Film production was done by Michael Silverman, Bill Gallery, and Peter O'Neill.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This essay focuses on several instances of death and memorialization within two generations of the Edwardses in eighteenth-century New England, namely, the families of Timothy Edwards, born in 1669, and of his son Jonathan, who both died in the same year, 1758. Attitudes about death and separation reveal much about father, son, and their extended families, attitudes qualified by age, gender, and other factors, and suggesting wider and richer possibilities for post-puritan religious culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"My associate, Dr. Laura Nash received a 2011 National Endowment for the Humanities grant to present a workshop on the life and work of Duke Ellington," said Torff, "and we wanted to put together a band that would do new things with his music." The concept grew into a mash-up where Torff composed and arranged music that mixed Ellington with Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Cream, and Pharrell Williams. It is a mash-up concept with jazz-rock roots but with a unique twist," said Torff.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Jack Roosevelt Robinson rose from humble origins to cross baseball's color line and become one of the most beloved men in America. A fierce integrationist, Robinson used his immense fame to speak out against the discrimination he saw on and off the field, angering fans, the press, and even teammates who had once celebrated him for "turning the other cheek." After baseball, he was a widely-read newspaper columnist, divisive political activist and tireless advocate for civil rights, who later struggled to remain relevant as diabetes crippled his body and a new generation of leaders set a more militant course for the civil rights movement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the turbulent 1960s, change was coming to America and the fault lines could no longer be ignored — cities were burning, Vietnam was exploding, and disputes raged over equality and civil rights. A new revolutionary culture was emerging and it sought to drastically transform the system. The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense would, for a short time, put itself at the vanguard of that change.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>I have spent the last two decades studying medieval and early modern Islamic maps in depth. These studies involved extensive on-site visits to manuscript libraries through which I collected thousands of images of medieval Islamic maps ranging in date from the eleventh century to the nineteenth. The sheer number of these extant maps tells us, at least from the thirteenth century onwards when copies of these map-manuscripts begin to proliferate, that the world was a much-depicted place. It loomed large in the medieval Muslim imagination. It was pondered, discussed, and copied with minor and major variations again and again, and all with what seems to be a peculiar idiosyncrasy to modern eyes: the cartographers did not strive for mimesis (imitation of the real world). They did not show irregular coastlines even though some of the geographers whose work includes these maps openly acknowledge that the landmasses and their coastlines are uneven. They present instead a deliberately schematic layout of the world and the regions that comprised the Islamic empire that can be best described as "carto-ideographs."&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; I started a digital project called MIME—Medieval Islamic Maps Encyclopedia—to place these maps on an interactive CD and online web-based format in order to make this rich resource available to scholars, students, and the general public. The mainstay of MIME are the maps found in the manuscripts of al-I??akhri, Ibn ?awqal, and al-Muqaddasi—also known as the "Islamic Atlas." The aim of MIME is to decode the place and space matrix on these carto-ideographs so that anyone, with or without Arabic, can browse them and understand how medieval Muslim cartographic artists and their patrons perceived their world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From 1905 to 1930, decisive years for our contemporary culture, Paris was the epicenter of a storm of modernism.  Catalyst and magnet for radical innovation and experiment, the city on the Seine was a gathering point for young creative talent from Michigan to Moscow, from Brooklyn to Barcelona. In twenty-five years they revolutionized the arts of the Western world, creating "new and fascinating forms that have become a rich part of our lives today."  On-camera, dramatic and historic moments come alive in rare archival interviews, as they are recalled by participants in these legendary events, including Marc Chagall, Joan Miro, Igor Stravinsky, Jean Cocteau, Aaron Copland, Marcel Duchamp, Janet Flanner, Tristan Tzara and Sylvia Beach.  In the art world's first international avant-garde, the film spotlights keys figures, tracing who came to Paris and why, their friendships, collaborations and rivalries, what they made there and how being in Paris during the luminous years transformed them and their work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From the dawn of the seventeenth-century, when the first sea-weary pilgrims looked on in wonder as teeming pods of rights whales breached the waters off Cape Cod to the eve of the Civil War, when more than 700 of the 900 ships in the worldwide whaling fleet hailed from American ports and American whalemen dominated the globe, the epic story of the commercial pursuit of the largest creature on earth would be intimately bound up with the story of America: as a parable of American capitalism on the rise, as a case study in maritime culture at its most extreme, and as an allegory for the American, and the human experience—long before a restless sometime whaleman and would-be writer named Herman Melville ever went to sea. At once a sea adventure, a cautionary economic and environmental tale, and a mythic saga of man and nature, the film tells the saga of three centuries of American whaling—interweaving the riveting tale of the doomed whaleship Essex, which set sail from Nantucket in the summer of 1819 and the deeply moving story of a young whaleman named Herman Melville—whose own life and imaginative voyage into the deep would give rise to one of the greatest works of literature ever created by an American.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Slavery by Another Name challenges one of Americans' most cherished assumptions: the belief that slavery in this country ended with the Emancipation Proclamation. The film tells how even as chattel slavery came to an end in the South in 1865, thousands of African Americans were pulled back into forced labor with shocking force and brutality. It was a system in which men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of masters. Tolerated by both the North and South, forced labor lasted well into the twentieth century. Slavery by Another Name gives voice to the largely forgotten victims and perpetrators of forced labor and features their descendants living today. To help fill this void, Slavery by Another Name seeks to educate, demystify, and to capture the forgotten voices in our country's history so we can learn and move forward as a nation.</Abstract>

How does teaching with archival collections best capture for students on the elementary and secondary levels the interpretive properties of history? &amp;#x0D; Central to the work of the Center on History and Education, these questions were explored by pre-service teachers in a course about the history of education in New York City. Teaching in the Archives documents students' experiences doing archival research and captures their thoughts about incorporating the archives as both a concept and practice into the teaching of history in public school classrooms.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Multiscope is the most recent manifestation of my experiments with New Media spectatorship.  As a sculpture-interface for viewing my New Media movies made with machinima (real-time animation captured in a 3D video game environment or virtual world), it is inspired by early motion picture viewing devices like the Mutoscope and Kinetoscope, Nam June Paik's sculptures, discourses about windows and interface in New Media scholarship, and the postphenomenological approach to technics advanced by Don Ihde that considers the embodied, hermeneutic, and alterity relations we have with artifacts like iPads, televisions, and other screens.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Mine Wars is a two-hour documentary for the PBS history series AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. The film tells the largely overlooked story of America's largest labor uprising, which took place in the mountains of southern West Virginia during a tumultuous period in American history. In Appalachia, the arrival of the coal industry--the primary energy source in the early 20th century--brought native mountaineers, African-American migrants, and European immigrants into a protracted struggle for their rights as working people in a changing American democracy. The film will highlight the years of violence that accompanied the miners' attempts to form a union, culminating in the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921, the largest civil insurrection in the United States since the Civil War.</Abstract>

The town-hall style event was the culmination of the student-veterans' training and work as embedded discussion facilitators in the class; they chose literary selections from the class, discussed them, and took part in dialogue reflecting on their service in the military, to the DEW project, and on the humanities' role in understanding and articulating veterans' experience. Program includes roll-over edited segments featuring photos and mementos of each student-veteran. The program was hosted by the director of GSU's Veterans Resource Center, Kevin Smith, and includes appearances by project co-directors Rosemary Johnsen (segment 1 of 3) and Andrae Marak segment 2 of 3).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Amahl and Mohammad are both Palestinian, but Mohammad is a refugee born in the West Bank, while Amahl holds an Israeli passport and was born in the US. When Amahl went to a protest for refugee rights in Israel and saw there many of Mohammad's American and European colleagues, she called him in frustration that he could not be there because of Israel's movement restrictions. He replied with a generous provocation: "Why don't you take pictures for me?" From there begins an exchange of photographs and a set of video explorations about expression, mobility, Palestinian collectivity, and the limits of what one friend can do for another.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This webinar explores ways for middle and high school students to "live" transformational moments in U.S. history through the Mission US educational gaming series. Presenter Peter Mabli, Assistant Director of Online Professional Development at the American Social History Project, uses the first Mission US game, "For Crown or Colony?," to introduce effective ways to integrate "serious games" into U.S. history curriculum. The session unpacks ways to integrate gaming with document-based activities, writing prompts, and other resources in a range of learning environments. It showcases ideas for independent, small group, whole class and flipped learning approaches, while meeting rigorous content and instructional standards. Technology-infused gaming can help students experience a more personal, memorable, and meaningful connection with complex historical content, as they learn to think like historians, develop historical empathy, and discover the role of ordinary men, women, and young people in U.S. history. This session will be of particular benefit to middle and high school teachers and librarians, as well as curriculum specialists and instructional technology specialists. The webinar also discusses strategies for including English language learners and struggling readers in the full learning experience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin is a feature documentary exploring the remarkable life and legacy of the late feminist author Ursula K. Le Guin. Best known for groundbreaking science fiction and fantasy works such as A Wizard of Earthsea, The Left Hand of Darkness, and The Dispossessed, Le Guin defiantly held her ground on the margin of "respectable" literature until the sheer excellence of her work, at long last, forced the mainstream to embrace fantastic literature. Her fascinating story has never before been captured on film.  Produced with Le Guin's participation over the course of a decade, Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin is a journey through the writer's career and her worlds, both real and fantastic. Viewers will join the writer on an intimate journey of self-discovery as she comes into her own as a major feminist author, opening new doors for the imagination and inspiring generations of women and other marginalized writers along the way. The film features stunning animation and reflections by literary luminaries including Margaret Atwood, Neil Gaiman, David Mitchell, Michael Chabon, and more.  Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin was created with the generous support of the National Endowment for the Humanities, California Humanities, the Berkeley Film Foundation, and 3,185 backers on Kickstarter.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Flintknapping: Merging Mind and Body", ARF Brownbag (UC Berkeley), 4 April 2018. My work is focused on situating the transmission of flintknapping knowledge between mobile Epipaleolithic (20,000 - 10,500 BP) hunter-gatherer peoples of the Levant through chaîne opératoire. By refitting bladelet cores at Kharaneh IV, Jordan, I strive to identify how individuals learned to flintknap, from raw material acquisition through the production of the final tool. I view the knowledge transmission process as a proxy for culture, as apprentices took on new ideas and identities to fit within a community of practice, the apprentice may have lost (or maintained) kinship ties yet subscribed to a more meaningful relationship within their community of practice. Kharaneh IV is an Early and Middle Epipaleolithic aggregation site well -situated for this research to examine the learning process due to its well-preserved stratigraphy numerous caches, and hut structures, which allows for observation of repetitive practices and identification of changes in technique. Current (and future) experimental flintknapping events in conjunction with 3D imaging and core refitting have been employed to establish baseline knowledge regarding the relationship between skill level and social structures that influence the production process.</Abstract>

Our featured guests for the evening are Ethan Michaeli, author of The Defender: How the Legendary Black Newspaper Changed America (2015), The Obsidian Collection Archives founder Angela Ford, and City Bureau Co-Founder Darryl Holliday. The evening's conversation between Michaeli, Ford and Holliday is part of a year-long series, Chicago 1919: Confronting the Race Riots, led by the Newberry Library.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>During the 20th century African Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans migrated to Chicago from other parts of the country and the world. European-descended residents and recent immigrants responded to these migrations with policies and choices that segregated the city. The 1919 Race Riots in particular set in motion efforts to keep groups of people separate, utilizing a powerful combination of violence, intimidation, and law - from neighborhood associations and restrictive covenants to redlining and contract purchase schemes. Today we have still not solved how to break down the spatial boundaries that separate Chicagoans. Leading the conversation were Lee Bey, architectural critic, photographer, and writer; Dr. Tanesha House, speaker, educator, consultant, and west side activist; and Brad Hunt from the Newberry Library, a historian of housing in Chicago.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This program explored how the legacy of the 1919 riots and the resulting hardening of segregation influenced the trajectory of Chicago's education system. Elizabeth Todd-Breland, Assistant Professor of History at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of A Political Education: Black Politics and Education Reform in Chicago Since the 1960s, provided an overview of the history of segregation in Chicago's public schools, and especially the relationship between segregation in housing and in schooling, from the early 20th century through the 1970s. Jen Johnson, Chief of Staff at Chicago Teacher's Union and Former CPS History Teacher, discussed how she dealt with teaching this aspect of the city's history to public school students; and also addressed the current state of school segregation and contemporary organizing. The two speakers then engaged in a wide-ranging conversation with each other and opened the discussion to questions and feedback from the audience.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Chicago 1919 Race Riots were the most violent week in Chicago history, sparked by the death of Eugene Williams, an African American teenager stoned and drowned by a white man for floating his raft over an invisible line into a whites-only South Side beach. The police refused to arrest the white perpetrator, and the city erupted in arson, looting, and thirty-eight deaths (23 black, 15 white), until the National Guard was called to restore order. The riots inflicted lasting scars on the city, still visible in the lines of segregation throughout the city's built environment, its schools, and its selective policing. The Opening Event of our year-long series of conversations on the history and legacy of the 1919 race riots.  What happened one hundred years ago on a Chicago beach during a sweltering summer day? How and why did violence erupt across the city? What were the effects of the riots in the ensuing decades? And what can we learn from the past that might help us imagine a better future?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The pilot episode rough cut (07:05) tells the story of the life and times of Bessie Coleman (1892-1926), the first African American female pilot, highlighting her achievements, putting them into a historical context, and demonstrating her legacy on future generations of black aviators. The important events of Coleman's biography are intercut with various humanities themes, including: challenges to gender roles and race-based limitations, technological change, class issues, historical events like the Great Migration, race riots, segregation, the Ku Klux Klan, and lynchings, and the limited but nonetheless real opportunities for black women in the new industrial urban age at the turn of the 20th century. The video showcases our signature style, mixing archival black and white photographs, films, and newspaper images together with Chabannes' unique and colorful artwork and animations. It features on-camera interviews with playwright and actress Madeline McCray, who wrote a play about Coleman ("A Dream to Fly") and was profoundly influenced by her, and U.S. Air Force Colonel Merryl Tengesdal, the first and only African American woman to fly the U2 plane, and one of only 4% of pilots in the U.S. today who are women. Narration signposts critical facts about Coleman's life and context, and voice-over brings her own voice back to life with quotations pulled from newspaper interviews she conducted during her lifetime. The music is contemporary, and the editing style is fast-paced and dynamic.   All members of our academic advisory board have provided feedback along the way, and have signed off on this rough cut.   Please note the following caveats: -Archive is TEMP/not yet licensed, and some images are watermarked -Some animations are still in storyboard phase -Voice-Over and Narration are TEMP -Music is TEMP -Video is not sound mixed -Video is not color corrected</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"Sammy Davis, Jr.: I've Gotta Be Me" is the first major film documentary to examine Davis' vast talent and his journey for identity through the shifting tides of civil rights and racial progress during 20th-century America. Sammy Davis, Jr. had the kind of career that was indisputably legendary, so vast and multi-faceted that it was dizzying in its scope and scale. And yet, his life was complex, complicated and contradictory. Davis strove to achieve the American Dream in a time of racial prejudice and shifting political territory. He was the veteran of increasingly outdated show business traditions trying to stay relevant; he frequently found himself bracketed by the bigotry of white America and the distaste of black America; he was the most public black figure to embrace Judaism, thereby yoking his identity to another persecuted minority. Featuring new interviews with such luminaries as Billy Crystal, Norman Lear, Jerry Lewis, Whoopi Goldberg and Kim Novak, with never-before-seen photographs from Davis' vast personal collection and excerpts from his electric performances in television, film and concert, "Sammy Davis, Jr.: I've Gotta Be Me" explores the life and art of a uniquely gifted entertainer whose trajectory blazed across the major flashpoints of American society from the Depression through the 1980s.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Written and produced by John Maggio and narrated by Korean-American actor John Cho, Korea: The Never-Ending War sheds new light on the global upheaval that led to the Korean War in 1950, a moment when the Cold War turned hot, and how today that war's brutal legacy has forced the world into a deadly nuclear showdown. With testimony from the soldiers on the frontlines, civilians caught in the crossfire, political leaders from then and now, journalists and historians, the film is a comprehensive re-examination of a war that took the lives of tens of thousands of American GIs and millions of Koreans. It is a war that has raged for generations. A war that most Americans don't remember, and Koreans can never forget. The film documents how the conflict has continued post-1953; the events that triggered North Korea's nuclear program; and South Korea's economic expansion. The consequences of the war's stalemate contribute to a dangerous stand-off between north and South Korea, the United States and China. The 'end' of this conflict is still an open question.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Just down the road from Woodstock, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a parallel revolution blossomed in a ramshackle summer camp for disabled teenagers. Steeped in humor and the music of the era, Crip Camp explores the universal experience of summer camp awakenings that would transform lives and shape the future of the disability rights movement. Told from the point of view of former camper Jim LeBrecht, the film traces the journeys of campers - both successful and tragic - up to the present day, in this compelling and untold story of a powerful journey towards inclusion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On December 10th, 1869 the territory of Wyoming ratified into law the right for women to vote. Stories abound across the state regarding the reasons why Wyoming women were granted the right to vote 150 years ago. Was it a question of statehood; or did citizens respect the vital role women played in ranching, farming, community, business and family rearing; or did it have to do with a tie breaking vote by a controversial brothel owner from South Pass City? These are all questions that WyomingPBS, in partnership with Caldera Productions, address in "The State of Equality."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The topic of this seminar is truth in the sense formulated by Tarski, that is, as a semantic notion (if one doesn't like the idea of truth being a semantic notion, one could think of it as the notion of ‘expressing a truth'). As is well known, there are problems, generated by various paradoxes, the most famous being the Liar. We will discuss, among other things, Tarski's original approach and how it might be extended. The relevance of Gödel's work, and alternative ways of looking at the (first) Gödel incompleteness theorem. And, of course, my own work in this area, which in addition to a treatment of truth, mentions some other ways of looking at the Gödel incompleteness theorem. I also hope to discuss the relevance of various fixed points and alternative valuation schemes. In addition, the view, advocated by Yablo and others, that Truth Tellers ought to be definitely false, not indeterminate, and how this might be developed in my own approach. If time permits, we may discuss later developments, alternatives or extensions of my own work (such as the revision theory of truth, Hartry Field's approach, our own Graham Priest's dialetheist treatment, etc.).</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Between the 1930s and the 1970s there was a general consensus amongst logicians that the best solution to the Liar and related paradoxes was Tarskian: no language can be allowed to contain its own truth predicate. In the 1970s this consensus disappeared, and it is now more generally held that an appropriate solution should accommodate a language with its own truth predicate. How that should be done is, of course, another matter.  In this course, we will be reading and discussing a number of papers that deal with that issue from a variety of different perspectives. Topics to be discussed include (hopefully): classical vs non-classical logic, definitions of truth vs axiomatic theories, fixed point constructions, dialetheism, conditionals and restricted quantification, revenge paradoxes, sub-structural solutions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This class will consist in my own introductory approach to recursion (computability) theory. Some of its basic results, though very easily recognized as true by experts, are not usually given as foundational in textbooks. My approach tries to tie recursion theory to basic ideas in formal logic. Topics to be covered include: the intuitive concept of computability and its formal counterparts, the status of Church's Thesis, my RE language, the basic ‘generated sets theorem' and the ‘upwards generated sets theorem', the enumeration theorem, the road from the inconsistency of the unrestricted comprehension principle to the Gödel – Tarski theorems, the narrow and broad languages of arithmetic, Cantor's diagonal principle, different versions of Gödel's Theorem, an enumeration theorem for partial recursive functions, languages with a recursively enumerable but non-recursive set of formulae, the uniform effective form of Gödel's theorem, the second incompleteness theorem, the self-reference lemma, the Tarski-Mostowski-Robinson theorem, the enumeration operator fixed-point theorem, the first and second recursion theorems, and the jump operator. If time permits, we may be able to cover the arithmetical hierarchy and the jump hierarchy, the ?-rule, hyperarithmetical and ? 1^1 sets, Borel sets, ? 1^1 sets, normal form theorems, the Baire category theorem, incomparable degrees, and related topics.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This film is about people's singer, songwriter, and Maoist cultural leader Khusiram Pakhrin's musical journey through nearly 4 decades of political movements and revolution in Nepal.  This is the first film about Nepal's revolutionary singer-songwriter Khusiram Pakhrin, and so far the only film that focuses on the songs of Nepal's Maoist movement. From the 1980s through 2006, their live performances were often banned and rarely photographed or recorded; hence we rely on Khusiram Pakhrin and his fellow performers for oral history and rare photos and footage of underground performances.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>While President Lyndon B. Johnson is remembered today largely for his failure in Vietnam, this podcast tells a different story, revealing his unprecedented success in shaping domestic politics. Medicare, civil and voting rights, clean air and water, Head Start, immigration reform, public broadcasting — how did Lyndon Johnson pull it off? That's the question we'll be exploring through the recorded recollections of those who were there when this history was being made, and who had a hand in its making.

		<Abstract>There are no other sense-altering aspects of culture that equate with language's effect on aural perception (hearing). Increased sensitivity to pitch is a cognitive characteristic in the 60% of the world's ethnolinguistic cultures that speak tone languages (Yip 2002). Lexical tone is a pitch contrast akin to the contour of a melody that distinguishes between words. An example is [íké] (high-high, like a repeated note) and [íkè] (high-low, like a falling interval) which forms a minimal pair between the Ìgbò words for strength and buttocks. Being a tone language speaker also impacts ways of musicking, especially singing. This is the case in sub-Saharan Africa, where "language and music are [] tied, as if by an umbilical cord" (Agawu 2016:113).  A favorite tool for evangelism among 19th- and 20th-century European missionaries in West Africa was to translate European hymn texts into the language of the missionized and teach them to sing the translation to the original hymn tune. An example included in the video is "All hail the power of Jesus' name" which is often sung to the Coronation hymn tune by Oliver Holden (1792). Unfortunately, early missionaries would translate the texts metrically (to preserve the number of syllables) but had no understanding of the necessary tone. Drawing on field recordings gathered in Nigeria from 2011–2020 by the authors, and commentary by Ekwueme and Dr. Christian Onyeji, this SMT-V entry studies the phenomenon of "tone-and-tune" in Ìgbò culture.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For years writers of fan fiction were shamed, the butt of jokes, and even subject to copyright litigation. However, in the past few years, with the fan fiction writers of today becoming the published mainstream authors of today the past time is a celebrated benchmark of one's climb to publication. In the season two premiere of "It's Lit," we explore what happened and how fan fiction writers were able to come out of the proverbial closet of shame. Hosted by Lindsay Ellis and Princess Weekes, "It's Lit!" is a show about our favorite books, genres and why we love to read. It's Lit has been made possible in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring the human endeavor.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Tolkien is widely regarded as the most influential author on the fantasy genre… period. But one of the less-discussed aspects of his work is the way Tolkien used constructed language in his writing. Nowadays authors are constantly making up words and languages for the worlds they build, but Tolkien was unique in that he constructed languages first, and then created worlds so his fictional languages would have somewhere to live.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Before women were asking "Am I a Carrie or a Samantha?", they were asking "Am I a Jo or an Amy?" Before there was Edward vs Jacob, there was Laurie vs Professor Bhaer. And over the more than 150 years since Little Women was originally published, there have been (deep breath) dozens of adaptations, feature films, television adaptations, plays, ballets, operas and at least two animes based on it. So despite being written off as proto-chick lit or kiddie lit or as Alcott herself said, "moral pap for the young," Little Women has worked its way into the consciousness of readers for the last 150 years, and has stayed there. But what is it about the tale of the March sisters that keeps us coming back?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One hundred years after the passage of the 19th Amendment, The Vote tells the dramatic culmination story of the hard-fought campaign waged by American women for the right to vote, a transformative cultural and political movement that resulted in the largest expansion of voting rights in U.S. history. In its final decade, from 1909 to 1920, movement leaders wrestled with contentious questions about the most effective methods for effecting social change, debating the use of militant, even violent tactics, as well as hunger strikes and relentless public protests. The battle also upended previously accepted ideas about the proper role of women in American society and challenged the definitions of citizenship and democracy. Exploring how and why millions of 20th century Americans mobilized for––and against––women's suffrage, The Vote brings to life the unsung heroes of the movement and the deep controversies over gender roles and race that divided Americans then––and continue to dominate political discourse today.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Perugino's Decemviri Altarpiece, painted for a frescoed chapel within what is now the National Museum of Umbra was disassembled and taken to Paris by Napoleonic forces leaving behind only the frame. The main panel was eventually returned to Italy but was sent not to Perugia but to the Vatican where it has remained until the personal friendship of two curators, one at the Vatican, and one in Umbria prompted the reuniting of these works in their original location—though only for a few months.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>An analysis of the Castel Sant'Angelo (originally the Mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian) and its historical trajectory from pagan tomb, to Christian fortification and the site of a plague-ending miracle, to papal palace, and finally to museum. The site is an amalgam that lacks the pure expression of one era and has been largely ignored art historians but is also the ideal structure to rethink the discipline's biases and to look for meaning in transformation itself.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Ovetari Chapel in Padua contains the little that remains of Mantegna's great fresco cycle on the life of Saint James. These frescoes—Renaissance masterpieces—were blasted into countless fragments when American bombs hit the church during World War II in a raid that also narrowly missed Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel. For years, computer scientists and conservators worked to piece together the thousands of fresco shards that survive, and today, in the chapel, we see on the walls a combination of black and white photographs taken before the war, the fresco fragments, and in-painting by conservators. What does it mean to look at the fragmented work now? This great but ruined cycle has become a memorial to what has been lost to war. Museums and other cultural sites are filled with works of art that have been pawns in violent battles. How can we ensure these important stories are remembered, and prioritize the protection of our shared cultural heritage?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This dialogue explored the ways that trauma is transmitted and remembered across generations and focused on the relationship of perpetrators and victims of genocide. It brought together the daughter of a member of the French resistance, who later died in the Neuengamme Concentration Camp in 1945, and the son of a member of the "Ordnungspolizei," the uniformed police force in Nazi Germany, in a constructive, open-ended dialogue.   The session also included a screening and discussion of a brief documentary film, Amnesia, which explores the ways in which empathy and the arts can help people come to terms with the trauma of war.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This project builds upon a number of earlier efforts to chronicle the lives and stories of Native women, generally elders, and to capture important oral histories before they are lost.  Our project's goal, however, was to focus on the journeys and pathways of an intergenerational, but younger, group of contemporary Pueblo women who were often the "first" in their fields, or among the first women in their communities to cross traditional gender lines.  Using oral history methods, we ultimately interviewed twenty women from the Pueblo villages of New Mexico, women who have achieved some extraordinary goals while maintaining strong connections to their communities, culture, and traditions.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Forbes once called her "The Warren Buffett of vampires," but American author, Anne Rice has established herself as the literary queen of monsters of ALL kinds over her four-and-a-half decade career. Besides her 15 novels of the world-famous Vampire Chronicles series, she's also written 21 other books featuring all your favorite dark, supernatural, and undead beings: witches, ghosts, mummies, werewolves, aliens, demons, angels, Jesus. But the works of Anne Rice aren't just light, pulpy fun monster books--her vampires changed the landscape of genre fiction as we know it?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The planet is Arrakis. Also known as Dune. And y'all, it's a mess. December of this year, we were supposed to see the arrival of director Denis Villeneuve's interpretation of the 1965 novel Dune, which had been previously (and rather infamously) brought to life by David Lynch in 1984, and again in a three-part miniseries on the SyFy channel in the early 2000s. Now many sci-fi nerds were both excited and nervous about the new adaptation directed by Villeneuve, but owing to the ongoing plague of eternity, the release has been pushed back to next year. So in lieu of that, y'all have to use this video to tide you over. What is Dune? Why must the spice flow? And what is with all the sand?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Since at least 213 BCE, book burnings have been a reaction to the power of the written word. When roasting paper in a giant circle went out of style (at least in the intellectual sphere), the governments would take it upon itself to ban books. However, when we talk about book bannings today, we are usually discussing a specific choice made by individual schools, school districts, and libraries made in response to the moralistic outrage of some group. This, while still hotly-contested and controversial, is still nothing in comparison to the ways books have been removed, censored, and outright destroyed in the past. So on that happy note, let's … explore how the seemingly innocuous book has survived centuries of the ban hammer.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In this short video, five of the participating students of the Separate/Together exhibition of Fall 2020, Hannah Altman, Graham Fee, Amanda Cordell, Linnea Moody, and Melissa Nunez, discuss their work and thought os the Covid-19 pandemic. Faced with the uncertainty of the present these 2020 graduates speak with voices of the future.  The COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic has affected us in incalculable ways. As a division of Daytona State College, the Southeast Museum of Photography is keenly aware of the impact it has had on student life. When campuses across the country closed for the Spring semester, many BFA and MFA student exhibitions were reluctantly cancelled. Seeing these graduating students have the opportunity to show the culmination of their years of hard work taken away was heartbreaking.  This summer, the Southeast Museum of Photography put out an open call to any graduating students working in the medium of photography whose in-person thesis shows were canceled as a result</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Beethoven in Beijing, a feature-length documentary to air on PBS' Great Performances on April 16, dramatizes the resurgence of classical music in China through the legacy of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the first American orchestra to perform in the People's Republic. In 1973, at the invitation of President Richard Nixon and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, the orchestra harnessed the power of music to dismantle decades of isolation between the two superpowers.  Today, China is energizing the world of classical music, with legions of young musicians, glittering new concert halls and a lineup of superstar artists and composers. This remarkable story is brought to life through the Philadelphia Orchestra's nearly half-century experience in China, featuring such charismatic personalities as Conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin, pianist Lang Lang, and Oscar-winning composer Tan Dun.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Museum commissioned writer Valerie Dunn to create "Meet Rebecca VanDike" an original first-person theatrical performance staring D'Arcy Dersham as VanDike.    Four women of the VanDike family — Rebecca, Catherine, Ann, and Sarah — voted alongside each other in Montgomery Township in 1801. Rebecca VanDike's story and those of other voting women is part of the special exhibition "When Women Lost the Vote: A Revolutionary Story, 1776-1807."  A discussion between Dr. Marcella Micucci and D'Arcy Dersham is also available about making, scripting, and performing "Meet Rebecca VanDike."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Walter Winchell: The Power of Gossip traces the life and career of the syndicated columnist, radio news commentator and television host who pioneered the fast-paced, gossip driven, politically charged media culture that dominates today. At the height of his career, Winchell had a combined print and radio audience of 50 million and the power to make or break careers. He became the most feared and admired man in America, a man who transformed entertainment journalism and championed "Mr. and Mrs. America" in his daily columns and Sunday night radio program. Decades later, an alliance with Senator Joseph McCarthy and feuds with Josephine Baker and Ed Sullivan turned his audience against him and forced him into obscurity.  Featuring Stanley Tucci as Winchell and narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, this American Masters documentary breathes new life into Winchell's original newspaper columns and broadcast scripts, drawing on rare recordings and a recently digitized collection of his work in the Billy Rose Theatre Division at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Winchell's own words comprise nearly a quarter of the script as the film tracks the rise and fall of his career, and his continued influence on today's media. "He was not only present at the creation of modern journalism," concludes biographer and film interviewee Neal Gabler, "in many respects he was the creation."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On March 27, 1961, nine Tougaloo College students—Meredith Anding Jr., James Bradford, Alfred Cook, Geraldine Edwards, Janice Jackson, Joseph Jackson Jr., Albert Lassiter, Gloria Pierce, and Ethel Sawyer—held a sit-in at the Jackson Municipal Library. The Tougaloo Nine were members of the Tougaloo College NAACP Youth Council.  The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, which opened alongside the Museum of Mississippi History in 2017, explores the period from 1945 to 1976, when Mississippi was ground zero for the Civil Rights Movement nationally. The museum features an exhibit about the Tougaloo Nine in "A Tremor in the Iceberg" gallery.  This video was developed by the MDAH and Two Mississippi Museums education teams.

The oral history center worked with Breakthrough's Film Crew, a group of nine young people from East Garfield Park and other West Side communities, to conduct these interviews. Breakthrough and the East Garfield Park Youth Collaborative recruited most of the narrators. All narrators had strong connections to the West Side, mainly East Garfield Park and North Lawndale. A transcription company, interns, and a volunteer created the transcriptions comprising this collection, known as Forty Blocks: The East Garfield Park Oral History Project.</Abstract>

Using photography by Richard Cross that illustrates what happened during that time, singers such as Carlos and Luis Enrique Mejía Godoy, Norma Helena Gadea, Francisco "Pancho" Cedeño, Pablo Martínez Téllez "El Guadalupano", Katia Cardenal and Mario Montenegro reflect on the role played by their songs during the revolution and by extension, the role of music in any political movement.

The purpose of this video is to celebrate the Afro-Colombian community of Palenque de San Basilio using the contemporary art of this amazing group of Palenque's musicians with photos of the community taken by photographer Richard Cross, who documented life in the community in the 1970s. The original sequence editing was done by Marta Valier. William Kwon did additional editing. We thank Kombilesa Mi for allowing us to use their music video.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The cast and crew of SYZYGY: The BLK Light Mixtape shares what it's like to develop a devised theater production while in a virtual environment. This behind-the-scenes look showcases some of the challenges students faced, from learning how to position themselves in front of a camera to building trust despite never meeting each other in person. As the team workshopped ideas throughout the semester, cast members were allowed to incorporate their own stories into the script.  Based on the initial idea to work with CSUN's Tom &amp;amp; Ethel Bradley photographic collections, Professors Douglas Kaback and J'aime Morrison teamed with the Center director José Luis Benavides and researchers Marta Valier and Guillermo Marquez to curate a selection of Richard Cross photos documenting life at San Basilio de Palenque in Colombia. The UNESCO Intangible Heritage site was settled sometime in the late 16th century by a group of Africans who had escaped enslavement as they were being trafficked through the nearby port of Cartagena, a hub of the slave trade for the colonial Americas. Benkos Biohó, born to a royal family in what is now Guinea-Bissau, proved a formidable leader and secured freedom and sovereignty for himself and hundreds of other would-be slaves before he was captured and executed in betrayal of a treaty with the local government. The village gained sovereignty by royal decree in 1713 and continues today with arts and customs strongly inflected by the traditions of its African forebears, and it is that community that Richard Cross documented in the 1970s with a realistic, unidealized, and non-paternalistic gaze.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One major project in need of immediate mitigation was a large-scale work entitled Baby Idol by Wallace Wilson. This work was added to the SMP collection in 1992. It is made up of a series of cellulose acetate sheets, similar to those used in x-rays. It has rarely been displayed as it is 13ft long and over 9ft wide. As such, it had been rolled in storage for many years. It was important to evaluate the condition of the work, take documentation photos, and make sure there was no evident damage after being left in storage for so long. During her site visit, photography conservator Kim Du Boise assessed the current state of the work and advised museum staff to add archival buffered interleaving tissue to create a barrier that would stabilize and protect the emulsion. The outside of the work was then wrapped with tyvek, an archival water-resistant material that will keep the piece protected from dust for long-term storage. Rehousing oversized works like this one is imperative to preserve the longevity of the work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Behind-the-scenes video shared on the Southeast Museum of Photography's social media account, showing SMP Director Erin Gordon treatment of R.H Lesene's orotype from 1910, based on recommendations by photography conservator Kim Du Boise.   During the spot check, Mrs. Du Boise identified another crucial conservation project – to remove soil on the surface and replace the cardboard backer on a vintage 1910 orotone by Volusia County photographer R. H. LeSesne. This orotone featuring a bucolic Florida waterscape was acquired by the museum in 2001. Given its age – over 110 years old – the work is in remarkable condition with only moderate scratches and soil build up on the surface of the plate, concentrated near the perimeter of the frame. However, the backing board used in framing was non-archival cardboard which is acidic and can cause deterioration of the plate with prolonged exposure. As such, it was necessary to unframed and replace the backing board.  Photography conservator Kim Du Boise examined this work during her spot check of the inventory and advised SMP staff about what could safely be done to remove the dirt and grime from the surface, and mitigate further damage caused by the acidic board. Upon advice of the conservator, SMP Director Erin Gordon carefully removed the rusted nails holding the cardboard backer in place. Then, using soft, lint-free, anti-static wipes and distilled water, Gordon carefully cleaned the surface to remove the built up soil. A new acid-free, archival backing board was cut to replace the cardboard and a thin protective layer of Plexiglas was added to shield the surface from further scratches. Rust-resistant framer's points secured everything in place, and the work is now ready for display.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Ginsberg's Karma is an insightful and entertaining look at a transformative phase in the poet Allen Ginsberg's life -- his first trip to India in 1962 would transform him into America's first hippie. While in India, he experimented with mind-altering drugs, spiritualism, and became a political activist. The documentary follows poet Bob Holman as he travels to India to piece together Ginsberg's life there, and interviews many of the writers who knew him during his trip. Ginsberg's adventures and what he experienced in India are the bridge between the Beat generation of the 1950s to the hippie counterculture of the 1960s in America.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Letters to Eloisa brings to life the story of the Cuban poet, essayist, and novelist José Lezama Lima, an all but forgotten figure of the Latin American literary boom that included Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Octavio Paz and Mario Vargas Llosa. Lezama's semi-autobiographical opus Paradiso, which included homoerotic passages, broke the silence on homosexuality in Cuba and sent shockwaves throughout the Spanish-speaking literary world. It also set its author on a collision course with the Cuban Revolutionary government. Told through letters written by Lezama to his sister in exile, the film is a haunting portrait of the writer's life, his struggle for artistic freedom, and tragic end.</Abstract>

THE ODYSSEY, THE ILIAD, THE AENEID, THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH, BEOWULF. At some point, we're going to have to confront the lyrical beauty of big strong men in big strong armor fighting big strong monsters, saving their kingdoms, and loving on their ladies. Or loving their male best friend —but that's another poem. Today we're going to take a look at one particular Epic Poem and follow its long, winding journey from way, way, way long ago allllll the way to the present day, and we'll interrogate its relevance to our lives in the here and now. Come now, Geats and Danes, to the violent, bloody, mythic, mysterious world of BEOWULF.</Abstract>

But in the nearly 175 years since its publication, the collective definition of what it means to be "a woman on the outside of society" has changed and expanded dramatically—and yet here we are, still dissecting Charlotte Bronte's words and gravitating towards Jane as a protagonist. For those of you who have never read Jane Eyre or enjoyed one of the 8000 films, television, stage, or radio adaptations not to mention countless literary retelling here we go.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Here's the problem with tackling Ernest Hemingway—Ernest Hemingway himself. While the iconic author is mostly known for his feats of literary prowess, from The Sun Also Rises to For Whom the Bell Tolls, to countless short stories—perhaps his greatest fiction of all is his own self-mythologizing. As his brand grew in the 1920s and 30s, so too grew his celebrity and, well, his ego. So, with Ernie all the while throwing so much self-mythologizing in the mix that it became nearly impossible to separate the Man from the Myth. But gosh darn it, we're going to try.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Here on It's Lit!, we spend a lot of time pontificating on the high canon of books: Your Shakespeares, your Tolstoys, your… erotic beast wars fanfiction. But today we're craving something a little lighter, a little fluffier… you know, novels you pick up for the sake of just having something quick-- your beach reads, your airport novels, your Books of the Month. Books that, while you might never have to read them for a seminar or a class or that sweet clout, somehow manage to dominate most water cooler discussions about literature. We're talkin Your Dan Browns, your Jodi Picoults, your Where the Crawdads Sing, seriously, how has the book managed to be on the top of every bestseller lists for so many months, I don't even KNOW what it's about but it's my mortal enemy These are your blockbuster books, the bestsellers of the bestsellers--And whether or not you read them or turn your nose up at them, for better or worse, they are the tent poles that support the publishing industry.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Astro Boy, Dragon Ball, Akira, Sailor Moon, Demon Slayer, Death Note all these interesting, iconic anime have something very much in common they started off as: manga. Manga, by its most simplistic definition, are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan, which became extremely popular in the United States starting in the 80s and 90s. We've already touched on Western Graphic Novels and Comics, but you know we couldn't just leave it at that (not with this t-shirt). So today we're discussing manga as its own rich literature, reflecting the complicated political history of Japan.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The guy typically credited with inventing what we know as the modern novel was Miguel de Cervantes with his cumbersome 800+ page book, Don Quixote. But what if I told you that the real antecedent for the modern novel was created by… ladies. Before the rise of what would become the modern novel, there was Amatory fiction. Amatory fiction was a genre of fiction that became popular in Britain in the late 17th century and early 18th century. As its name implies, amatory fiction is preoccupied with sexual love and romance. Most of its works were short stories, it was dominated by women, and women were the ones responsible for sharing and promoting their own work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>To some people, the idea of a pen name seems kind of weird. If I, a writer, am going to put countless hours of hard work and thought into my masterpiece, why wouldn't I want to put my own name underneath the title? But from Stephen King to Ben Franklin to …., who had their own secret aliases, to Mark Twain and Dr. Seuss, whose pseudonyms became so famous that they are remembered by their pen names and not their actual names, the nom de plume has a long and proud history in the literary world.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Museum commissioned writer Theresa Miller to create "Meet Elizabeth Freeman" an original first-person theatrical performance staring Tiffany Bacon as Freeman.   Elizabeth Freeman or "Mumbet" was an enslaved woman in Massachusetts who sued for her own freedom in 1781 and won. She later told novelist Catherine Sedgwick that the Declaration of Independence had inspired her to do so.  A discussion between the Museum's Visitor Engagement Supervisor Meg Bowersox, actress Tiffany Bacon, and writer Teresa Miller is also available about making, scripting, and performing "Meet Rebecca VanDike."</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Journeys, a theatrical production for the stage, was a collection of six independent vignettes that illustrated fictional and non-fictional journeys that individuals with disabilities have taken, or have dreamed of taking.  All six journeys spanned fifty years and took places in various train, plane, and bus stations and were staged in an ambiguous passenger terminal by an all-ability cast, individuals with and without disabilities, of 23.  These stories were told through both movement, and dialogue and was @45 minutes in length. This production was the second production produced by Flutter Productions written in part by individuals with disabilities, but was the first to contain dialogue. This production was the result of a weekly play writing class at Flutter Productions. The intent was to entertain and shed light on disability culture and history. Highlights included one man's journey in be turned over to an institution in the 1940s at the age of two years old, and another man's journey to a workshop setting in a different state to gain valuable life skills to become more self sufficient and independent in the 1980s. The evening also included one woman's journey from the contained classroom, to an inclusive art classroom in her high school and the positive impact she still feels decades later.  This production hosted a talk back with the audience following the performances, and a facilitated talk back with the cast about the overall process.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Zenith was an all-ability (individuals with and without disabilities) dance theatre production performed by a cast of 31 individuals on June 29 &amp;amp; 30, 2018 in the Historic Theater at the Performing Arts Center of Rapid City. This production hosted a talk back with the audience following the performances, and a facilitated talk back with the cast about the overall process. The story centered on Mira, the daughter of a famous astronomer, who yearns to study the stars in a time where females are not permitted in higher studies. Guided by the fates, she sneaks into her father's laboratory at night to study the stars nonetheless. She discovers the first black hole. She then disguises herself to present her finding to the male scholars who initially applaud the finding, but upon discovering that she is a woman, reject it. Her father finds a different way to present her finding, and brings the male scholars around to listening to her. She is then permitted into the lecture hall and accepted as a teacher making history as the first woman to do so.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>ABLE: The Disability Chronicles was a series of contemporary dance and spoke word vignettes written by individuals with disabilities and those that support them about disabilities and disability culture. The production was originally produced in 2016, and in 2018 it was restructured to suit a smaller cast that could tour throughout the state of South Dakota. In 2016 it was the first production in the state of South Dakota to be written and performed in part by individuals with disabilities.  This production hosted a talk back with the audience following the performances, and a facilitated talk back with the cast about the overall process. Funding to make touring possible was provided in part by a Touring Artist Grant from the South Dakota Arts Council. The touring version of this production featured an all-ability (individuals with and without disabilities) cast of twelve individuals that performed twelve pieces.  The production contained the following themes: The lasting impacts and effects of labeling, Necessary devices, processes, and medications that assist, but also unintentionally diminish, Society's perception of diversely-abled individuals, The acceptance and normalization of individuals with disabilities, Communication and the importance of one-on-one interactions, Down syndrome, The experience of one person with autism, Overcoming challenges in pursuit of a goal, and The importance of opening doors in the world for others.  The production was first performed at the University of Sioux Falls, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota to an audience of students studying to become future educators, social workers, performing arts artists, lawyers, and psychologists. The second performance was performed for the state disability conference hosted by the University of South Dakota School of Medicine and Center for Disabilities.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Fifteen designers with diverse abilities were partnered one-on-one with a volunteer from the community to bring their original fashion design to fruition. The teams worked together once a week for six weeks which culminated in a fashion show for the public. Flutter Productions partnered with Jolly Lane Greenhouse, who hosted the fashion show in their Rose House. In addition to the partnership with Jolly Lane Greenhouse we partnered with Prima School of Dancing who selected several pieces to create introductory dances to on the runway.

		<Abstract>CoRPoREAL was an original all-ability (individuals with and without disabilities) dance theatre production based in contemporary dance. Performed by a cast of 30 individuals in the Studio Theater at the Performing Arts Center of Rapid City on June 27, 28 and 29, 2019. The production was written in part by the Flutter Productions Play Writing class with Heather Pickering.  A facilitated conversation was held with the cast and crew following this production.   The production, featuring original music composed by Andrew Grace, and choreography by Sara Olivier, explored the depths of connectivity to everything inside our body, and how a physical sickness can also be caused by more than a virus or bacteria. No one thing operates independently –everything is connected to, or reliant upon, something else, thus the strings you will see throughout our production this evening.  One thing that we discovered is the importance of human touch and the physical and mental benefits that we receive every time we connect with another person through touch, a handshake, or a welcomed hug. Through our explorations, ideas, personal life experiences, and a few poems, CoRPoREAL was born. CoRPoREAL also hosted two designers with disabilities who designed select costumes that reflected and extended their artistic pursuits as visual artists at the Suzie Cappa Art Center.</Abstract>

Join us for a screening of "Women of the Gulag" and Q&amp;amp;A with director Marianna Yarovskaya.  "Women of the Gulag" tells the compelling stories of several female labor camp survivors. While Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago largely recounts the experiences of the men caught in Stalin's camps, Marianna Yarovskaya's 2019 Oscar shortlisted documentary film features six women in their 80s and 90s as they go about their daily lives and reflect on their experiences. Their accounts range from the horrific to the uplifting. The film also juxtaposes the troubling resurgence of praise for Stalin with the fight to preserve and disseminate the memory of Soviet repressions, terror, and displacement.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the Virginia state record, only 1% of documented historical sites are categorized as having any African-American historical significance. It's easy to visit historic sites from the era of slavery and forget the enslaved men, women and children who built and maintained these places. Using Street View, Virginia Humanities has been collecting panoramic imagery of slave dwellings across the state for everyone to see. They hope these images will add to a more inclusive history of Virginia and helps us remember that enslaved peoples were integral to our country's founding.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Young Appalachian Story Summit is a young adult-led event that focuses on a critical issue: how young adults can use storytelling as a leadership tool to create Appalachia's future. Summit participants have the opportunity to hear from diverse voices within Appalachia; to understand how storytelling can help them take action in their own communities; and to join a network of like-minded young Appalachians to collaborate with beyond the event.   The 2021 Summit, Crossroads, focused on the intersections of who we are and how we engage our voices with the wider community. Participants collaboratively explored their own strengths at these "crossroads" and developed concrete ways to use these strengths as tools in their lives and work by using the power of storytelling to cultivate a united voice during global unease. The Summit included workshops, networking, story circles, and a panel discussion to empower young adults to share their voices with their wider communities and help shape Appalachia's future.</Abstract>

Our mission at SKC is to perpetuate the values and practices of the Chamoru culture by providing space for artisans and cultural practitioners to develop and exhibit their art form, sharpen their skills, and share and pass down knowledge of these practices. The CARES Act funded the reopening of SKC and provided an alternative to our Saturday weaving workshop through an online weaving segment.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>With CARES Act funding, Micronesia Climate Change Alliance delivered a web series that explores waste generation through a sociological approach. In order to curb the plastic waste crisis in our region, Micronesia Climate Change Alliance is directly advancing its mission to raise consciousness about waste consumption through digital media. Specifically this grant will fund a web series entitled "From Our Nånas, For Our Nenis" which investigates the history of how plastics were introduced to Micronesia followed by the current waste streams in existence today and local people working towards solutions. The primary audience benefitting from this funding is teachers, students, scholars and community members alike.</Abstract>

		<Producer>The short animation segment highlights how communities in Micronesia are facing a waste management crisis and landfills are reaching a tipping point. Globalization and rising consumerism have fueled this crisis in islands across the Pacific who are now grappling with how to sustain the amount of waste that is being generated. Through digital tools, the segment paints a picture of the waste crisis in Micronesia by showing viewers how plastic was introduced to our region, how it plays a role in our lives today, it's impacts on our lands/waters and how we can pull wisdom from our past to solve this present issue. This short animated segment is shared through MCCA's social media channels and virtual public presentations.</Producer>

		<Abstract>In June 2020, in the midst of the Black Lives Matter uprising, three BIPOC theatres—Conch Shell Productions, Kumu Kahua Theatre &amp;amp; Braata Productions—collaborated via Zoom to co-produce a series of performances reflecting the turbulence and violence of systemic racism in America that defined our lives as we all sheltered in place during the COVID19 pandemic. The collaborations led to five nights of powerful, thought-provoking new work productions, and revealing/enlightening dialogue between diverse theatre artists and audience members.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Historical maps contain detailed geographic information difficult to find elsewhere, but they typically exist as scanned images without searchable metadata. Existing approaches for making historical maps searchable rely on tedious manual work (including crowd-sourcing) to generate their metadata (e.g., geolocations and keywords). Optical character recognition (OCR) software could alleviate the required manual work, but the recognition results are individual words instead of location phrases (e.g., "Black" and "Mountain" vs. "Black Mountain"). Also, these recognized words are plain text and do not have semantic labels (e.g., place vs. road names). In an ongoing project, collaborating with the Alan Turing Institute, the British Library, the Library of Congress, and the University of Southern California Digital Library, we are developing a machine-learning map processing pipeline that automatically reads text from thousands of scanned historical maps and makes that text meaningful. The machine learning pipeline will transform how cultural heritage institutions can enrich and expose metadata about their digitized map collections. As a preliminary work for this project, this talk will present an end-to-end approach to address the real-world problem of finding and indexing historical map images. This approach automatically processes historical map images to extract their text content and generates a set of metadata linked to large external geospatial knowledge bases. The linked metadata support complex queries for finding and indexing historical maps, such as retrieving all historical maps covering mountain peaks higher than 1,000 meters in California. We have implemented the approach in a system called mapKurator. We have evaluated mapKurator using historical maps from several sources with various map styles, scales, and coverage. Our results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. The code has been made publicly available as modules of the Google</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by American author Mark Twain is both considered one of the great American novels and one of the most frequently banned and contested novels due to its use of the N-word and racial stereotypes. This has launched many debates as to if the work should even be taught in schools. Today we are going to attempt to crack the case: is Huckleberry Finn an anti-racist work? Or is it just plain ol' racist?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>H.G. Wells is a name that is synonymous with the creation of what we now know as science fiction. He effectively invented the subgenre of alien invasion, he coined now-ubiquitous terms "time machine," "heat ray" and even disputably "the new world order." But what most people don't know about Wells is that although today he is predominantly known for his science fiction, his career as an SF author was pretty short. Wells wrote dozens of novels, most of which weren't science fiction. But despite the relatively few science fiction works he wrote in comparison to his vast oeuvre, Wells was an influential thinker - not just for the genre of science fiction, but for science's relationship to the culture at large.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>One of the trademark texts of the American school system is Harper Lee's 1960 novel To Kill a Mockingbird. For decades it has been widely read in high schools and middle schools as a key anti-racist text. But how did this novel, with its Southern Gothic and Bildungsroman elements become a book that in 2006 the British said "every adult should read before they die" ahead of the Bible. To Kill a Mockingbird was written by Harper Lee and was loosely based on Lee's real-life experiences, the book tells the story of Jean Louise Finch, better known as Scout, a young girl growing up during the Great Depression in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama with her older brother Jeremy aka Jem, and her widowed lawyer father, Atticus Finch. A name that will be imprinted on the world … forever.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>From James Joyce's Ulysses to Bridget Jones's Diary, you've probably read a book that was just a modern retelling of a well-established story. Which is to say nothing of other forms of media and their own obsessions with retellings. And despite what your Writing 101 instincts might tell you, this is neither bad nor lazy writing—or even a new concept. Because let's be honest: sometimes a story is just so dang good, it bears repeating. Sometimes more than once. Sometimes multiple times. I'm looking at you, Jane Austen.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Elizabeth Bennet. Emma Woodhouse. Marianne Dashwood. Jane Austen has been responsible for creating some of the most frequently adapted and analyzed women in the English literary language. Along with Buzzfeed quizzes asking "which SATC or Little Women" character you are, there is always a lot of fanfare about which Jane Austen heroine you are. But beyond the big three. Well mostly … big two. Who are the women of Jane Austen's completed novels? How do they reveal to us, her modern audience, any insight into her growth as an author, her politics, and just how she feels about what makes a girlboss and #girlboss.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>It can be said that there are two types of fiction writers - those who take a backseat and let their work take the spotlight, and those who are as iconic as their work, sometimes even more so. But maybe there's a third type - a type of writer whose complex persona is so intertwined with their fiction - that to ignore them as a person would be to ignore their work entirely.

		<Abstract>Denver Brunsman and Carol Berkin discuss the letter sent by Lucy Knox to Henry Knox during the Revolutionary War. It captures a microcosm of the impact of war. She is alone; her family who were loyalists had fled; and she gives insights on what happens on the home front when your country has been involved in a war for a long period (over a year in this case). The letter also captures how she does not have an equal voice when she is outside the home, but she assets her equality to him in their home.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Many of our popular notions of the motives of the American revolutionaries have been mythologized by films, books, media, and political discourse. The popular image of a plucky American rebel who fought for freedom against a tyrannical king is a celebrated one. The reality was very different. Often practicality, economics, or even proximity to a particular army could determine which side was supported or could cause loyalties to change. This presentation (22:27 mins) features historian Dr. Susan Ouellette, who explores these complexities and introduces us to one such "practical patriot."   This video was created as part of the National Endowment for the Humanities Landmarks of American History and Culture Grant, "Freedom and Unity: The Struggle for Independence on the Vermont Frontier," coordinated by the Vermont Archaeological Society and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

		<Abstract>Mount Independence, a peninsula that juts out into Lake Champlain to the east of Fort Ticonderoga, was the site of a critical military installation during the American Revolution. At the height of its occupation by the rebel forces in the fall of 1776, the Mount was the second largest "city" in New England. The peninsula boasted fortifications, batteries, blockhouses, encampments, storehouses, workshops, barracks, a large general hospital, a floating bridge, a wharf, and even a giant crane. Following the war, the site quietly reforested, and today is one of the best-preserved archaeological sites from the Revolutionary War in the country.  In this short video, join our guest lecturer, historian Ennis Duling, for a virtual hike across the entire landform of Mount Independence. Filmed on location at the Mount Independence State Historic Site, May 7, 2021.  This video was created as part of the National Endowment for the Humanities Landmarks of American History and Culture Grant, "Freedom and Unity: The Struggle for Independence on the Vermont Frontier," coordinated by the Vermont Archaeological Society and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

		<Abstract>What was life like for women living in early Vermont? How did coverture play out in the early republic known for its revolutionary zeal? Let us return to the Ethan Allen household. On February 12, 1789, Ethan Allen dies. Amid the sorrow and mourning, the legal process of probate begins, and in the Allen household, this process was complicated by the fact that Ethan died intestate, or without a will. This throws the legal status and rights of the newly widowed Fanny Allen into question. What would Fanny inherit? What could she claim to be rightfully hers? How these questions were resolved sheds light on the legal and social experiences of women in late 18th and early 19th century Vermont.

		<Abstract>"Men their rights and nothing more; women their rights and nothing less." Written by suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, women's rights activists used this rallying cry to demand voting equality. But the suffrage movement included far more voices and perspectives than these two well-known names: throughout the fight for women's right to vote, generations of diverse activists demanded full access to the ballot box. Hosts Rosario Dawson and Retta guide us through this seven-part series, bringing us the stories we didn't learn in our history books.   And Nothing Less is a production of the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commission, the National Park Service, and PRX. It is the official podcast commemorating 100 years of the 19th Amendment and women's constitutional right to vote.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The American Diplomat explores the lives and legacies of three African American ambassadors — Edward Dudley, Terence Todman and Carl Rowan — who pushed past historical and institutional racial barriers to reach high-ranking appointments in the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations. At the height of the civil rights movement in the United States, the three men were asked to represent the best of American ideals abroad while facing discrimination at home. Oft reputed as "pale, male and Yale," the U.S. State Department fiercely maintained and cultivated the Foreign Service's elitist character and was one of the last federal agencies to desegregate. Through rare archival footage, in-depth oral histories and interviews with family members, colleagues and diplomats, the film paints a complex portrait of three men who left a lasting impact on the content and character of the Foreign Service and changed American diplomacy forever.  THE AMERICAN DIPLOMAT is co-produced by GBH/American Experience and FLOWSTATE Films.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>American Experience On Easter Sunday, 1939, contralto Marian Anderson stepped up to a microphone in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Inscribed on the walls of the monument behind her were the words "all men are created equal." Barred from performing in Constitution Hall because of her race, Anderson would sing for the American people in the open air. Hailed as a voice that "comes around once in a hundred years" by maestros in Europe and widely celebrated by both white and black audiences at home, her fame hadn't been enough to spare her from the indignities and outright violence of racism and segregation. Voice of Freedom interweaves Anderson's rich life story with this landmark moment in history, exploring fundamental questions about talent, race, fame, democracy, and the American soul.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Local high school students explore the 1918 Spanish Flu in Montana to come to terms with their own experience of the current pandemic in the film, No Ordinary Time. They focus on the overlooked impact of the Spanish Flu pandemic on Montana, one of the hardest hit states with the country's third-highest mortality rate. The Spanish Flu claimed 1% of Montana's population (5,000 lives) in 1918-1919. What can we learn from this earlier virus and our successes and missteps in responding to it? Working with local historians, filmmakers, professors, and health officials, students produced this film in a 2-week immersive summer-bridge program offered through Helena College.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>We remember Edgar Allan Poe for his tales of horror and the macabre as well as inventing the entire Detective Fiction Genre. But unlike many of the great authors of Western classic literature, he has become an icon unto himself, recognized to this day by name and face almost more than the titles of his stories and poems. But his legacy is more complicated than schoolbooks may have lead us to believe.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Unpacking the Universe: The Making of an Exhibition is a documentary series that follows the six-year journey of LACMA's curators Diana Magaloni and Julia Burtenshaw researching, developing, and installing The Portable Universe / El Universo en tus Manos. The series allows us to be transparent about how the team facilitated a collaborative process with the Arhuaco community in Colombia and curators at different institutions and kept this spirit of collaboration alive in the way the exhibition was installed.  Among many topics, the documentary features scenes of breathtaking landscapes and archeological sites; conversations with Mamo Camilo Izquierdo and Jaison Perez Villafaña regarding the Arhuaco worldview and how this relates to contemporary social and environmental issues; and behind-the-scenes footage of preparing the exhibition, including new initiatives around museum stewardship of Indigenous works.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Explore the life and times of author L. Frank Baum, the creator of one of the most beloved, enduring and classic American narratives. By 1900, when The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published, Baum was 44 years old and had spent much of his life in restless pursuit of success. With mixed results he dove into a string of jobs  — chicken breeder, actor, marketer of petroleum products, shopkeeper, newspaperman and traveling salesman — Baum continued to reinvent himself, reflecting a uniquely American brand of confidence, imagination and innovation. During his travels to the Great Plains and on to Chicago during the American frontier's final days, he witnessed a nation coming to terms with the economic uncertainty of the Gilded Age. But he never lost his childlike sense of wonder and eventually crafted his observations into a magical tale of survival, adventure and self-discovery, reinterpreted through the generations in films, books and musicals.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Witness a project 244 years in the making, conceived and produced by Kean University students, with support of faculty, staff, alumni, and neighbors. The film invites audiences to attend the wedding of future Founding Father John Jay to socialite Sarah Livingston, the daughter of the first elected governor of New Jersey. A colorful cast of characters leads the audience on an adventure around the mansion and grounds, as they experience the story through the eyes of "Lucius Horatio", a rambunctious young guest at the wedding.  Two versions of this film were created to give audience and museum-goers the exciting experience of feeling like they were actually there on this historic occasion.  The widescreen version was filmed with wide angle lenses and in first-person perspective to put the audience in Lucius' shoes. And the 360° virtual reality version takes that experience to the next level. Using VR headsets, audiences are transported into a fully immersive environment - with the sights and sounds of the day all around them. It is not just a movie - it's a time machine.  Liberty Hall 360: Revolutionary Wedding was created through the collaboration of students, faculty, staff and alumni of Kean University across multiple disciplines like graphic design, history, communication, writing and theatre.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The rise of Jim Crow in the late 19th century caused public school spending for African American students in the rural South to all but dry up. Rosenwald Schools, the shorthand name for a program put forward by the educator Booker T. Washington and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, offered a way for communities to build the schools they wanted and needed. Rosenwald Schools took root in 15 states, with the program eventually helping to build nearly 5,000 schoolhouses. The program was especially successful in North Carolina, which constructed nearly 800 schools, the most of any state. One reason for the program's success was dynamic leadership – Black and White, male and female – who shared the goal of creating better schools for Black communities, yet who operated largely within society's conventions of that era. North Carolina's Rosenwald Schools remind us of a time when community people with few resources were united by a vision for a better future. They invested in that future and struggled to achieve it. The story of Rosenwald Schools informs today's younger generations about an era that has been missing from history books. It also has valuable lessons about community building and cooperation, which are sorely needed in these fractious times.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Shine Award, BlackStar Film Festival, 2022  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas — until now. When Ruby Duncan faces the stigma and harassment of a fraud- obsessed and broken system she ignites "Mother Power," mobilizing a welfare rights group to march down the Strip demanding dignity, justice, democratic participation, and an adequate income in 1971. Based on the book "Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought Their Own War on Poverty" by Annelise Orleck, the film challenges the pernicious lie of the "Welfare Queen," and highlights the visionary leadership of low-income grassroots organizers whose courage, tenacity and dreams could not be quashed, against all odds.  Storming Caesars Palace uplifts the story of a band of ordinary mothers who launched one of the most extraordinary—yet forgotten—feminist, anti-poverty movements in U.S. history, providing a blueprint today for an equitable future.  With Mary Wesley and Alversa Beals, Ruby pushes the Las Vegas chapter of the National Welfare Rights Organization to fight for an adequate income, dignity, and justice alongside low-income mothers across the country. With the support of George Wiley and Frances Fox Piven, the NWRO campaigns for Universal Basic Income which, with feminist Gloria Steinem at their side, becomes part of the Democratic platform in 1972. When Las Vegas mothers are slashed from the welfare rolls, they launch "Operation Nevada." 1,500 people including Ralph Abernathy and Jane Fonda march down the Strip and shut down Caesars Palace. Ruby goes on to found Operation Life, one of the first women-led community corporations in the nation, and is appointed to President Carter's Council on Economic Opportunity. Storming Caesars Palace celebrates the Black women who set the stage for today's economic justice movements, revealing that it's the disenfranchised who fight for America's principle of opportunity for all.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This Humanities Discussion event, "Removal and the Right to Remain in the United States" featured speaker Samantha Seeley and took place on Wednesday, May 18, 2022, at 5 pm in the Henkelman Room at the Albright Memorial Library in Scranton, PA, as a part of the "Scranton's Story, Our Nation's Story" project led by The University of Scranton with community partners.  Samantha Seeley, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of History at the University of Richmond. Her book, Race, Removal, and the Right to Remain: Migration and the Making of the Early United States, highlights early efforts at U.S. nation building and the use of migration to construct a white republic. Situating the struggles of Native and Black Americans into the larger story of the early U.S, Seeley argues for a more inclusive way to tell the story of forced removal and its implications on early U.S. statehood.   This event is a part of the "Scranton's Story, Our Nation's Story" project's third theme, Indigenous History of Northeastern Pennsylvania.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>On Thursday, Nov. 17, at 7 p.m. Curtis Zunigha, enrolled member of the Delaware Tribe of Indians (Oklahoma) and co-founder/co-director of the Lenape Center in New York, offered a public keynote lecture on Forced Removal of the Lenape People: History and Homecoming in the DeNaples Ballroom of The University of Scranton.   Zunigha shared his experience and mission to heal the wounds of forced removal and colonization and his desire is to restore the circle of friendship, respect, and shared occupancy. This lecture is part of the Scranton's Story, Our Nation's Story initiative funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and supported by a grant through the Office of Equity and Diversity.  This visit is organized by the University of Scranton Office of Community Relations and the Scranton's Story, Our Nation's Story initiative, the Office of Equity and Diversity, and the History Department.   Last year, the University adopted a land acknowledgement statement which includes the Lenape as among those Indigenous peoples for whom Northeastern PA is their ancestral homeland:  The University of Scranton acknowledges the original inhabitants and nations of this land: the Lenape, the Munsee, the Shawnee and the Susquehannocks. May we be ever mindful of their legacy and contributions and commit ourselves to stewarding this land with care and compassion as we navigate our communities towards faith and justice.  Zunigha's lecture is aimed at fostering deeper learning and engagement in ways that honor Indigenous peoples and cultures and the history and ongoing legacy and impact of colonialism.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Bridge depicts the daily life and work challenges of two fictive refugee interpreters working in an humanitarian organization. The story and scenarios in the film are based on 8 months of ethnographic research findings gleaned through interviews and focus group discussions with current interpreters.  The film represents interpreters as subjects – moving, feeling, socially situated persons – who become the infrastructural possibility of humanitarian work.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>South Carolina built more than 500 so-called Rosenwald Schools under the program devised by Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald. This unique program was responsible for providing elementary schools for an estimated 40 percent of South Carolina's African American children, according to a researcher at Orangeburg State University. Virtually all of them lived in rural areas. As in other states, the Rosenwald Schools became the centers of strong, supportive communities that nurtured Black youth, helping to prepare them for high school and higher education. Above all, supportive communities and the schools' caring teachers prepared the students for life's challenges in the Jim Crow era.   The prospect of integrating the state's public schools in the early 1950s, at the behest of the federal government, led to swift action by the state's elected White officials to build new, "equal" schools for African American students. Though this plan did indeed build scores of schools, it did not prevent eventual integration.  In the final analysis, the scheme to build "equalization schools" helped erase many Rosenwald Schools from the landscape. This makes the surviving schools all the more important as physical reminders and interpretive sites for an almost-forgotten chapter of South Carolina history.  Rosenwald Schools were a step toward correcting the inequalities in public education created by Jim Crow policies.   One of the many ironies in this story is that South Carolina voters, in the Reconstruction Era, passed a remarkably progressive state constitution that guaranteed free education for all citizens, Black and White. The person who advocated most for this right was Robert Smalls. Smalls was a previously enslaved individual who earned notoriety in 1862 for stealing an armed Confederate vessel under cover of darkness in Charleston Harbor and delivering it to Union ships offshore. Smalls remained a proponent for education all his life.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>"The Five Demands" tells the riveting story about the student strike that changed the face of higher education forever. In April 1969, a small group of Black and Puerto Rican students shut down the City College of New York, an elite public university located right in the heart of Harlem. Fueled by the revolutionary fervor sweeping the nation, the strike soon turned into an uprising, leading to the extended occupation of the campus, classes being canceled, students being arrested, and the resignation of the college president. Through archival footage and modern-day interviews, we follow the students' struggle against the institutional racism that, for over a century, had shut out people of color from this and other public universities. The Five Demands revisits the untold story of this explosive student takeover, and proves that a handful of ordinary citizens can band together to take action and effect meaningful change.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Summary: This video explores the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to the impermanence of western paper produced between 1800-1950, when manual papermaking processes shifted to mechanization. It introduces the chemical composition of paper and the acidic pathways that lead to its untimely deterioration, as well as efforts cultural institutions are taking to extend the life of brittle paper-based materials (i.e., books, newspapers, documents) from this period.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This is the latest work sample of our in-production film, edited by Rachel Reichman. It highlights some of the film's main subjects who help project director Marisa Fox uncover her late mother's secret past and the larger, overlooked history of Jewish women's slave labor camps in Silesia and Sudetenland during the Holocaust. A journalist, Fox applies an investigative approach to her quest, moving past family members, who are conflicted and tight-lipped about her mother's secret. Instead, she turns to historical archives, scholars, survivors and witnesses, as her detective-like search unravels with suspense. Fox also finds a survivor in Berlin, who road-trips with her to the former Gabersdorf site. There, she hears camp songs that ring with defiance but also an eerie sexual subtext. At the core of the film is the collective camp diary in which Fox's mother wrote , which reveals an empowering story of sisterhood, resistance and faith, but it also confirms what Fox suspects may have kept her mother from speaking of her experiences --sexual violence. Because there is no historical footage of the camp, viewers are given access to this unseen world through visual renderings by artist Molly Schwartz, who will animate them for the completed film. We also hear passages read by teenage girls in Poland.  The subjects are indelible characters, each different from the other, living around the world, but joined together by a deep trauma they never previously shared. These are the last witnesses of a chapter of history that is well represented, but that shockingly neglected this narrative. Few filmmakers have explored the Holocaust through the lens of gender, which is one reason why My Underground Mother stands to make significant contributions to the humanities. The scholars, including last living Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz, help us understand why women's testimonies were buried as Fox seeks resolution.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Montana's capitol, designed at the end of the 19th century, was intended to be the "people's house," uniting diverse interests across what was then just a territory to form the 41st state. But does it continue to live up to those principles today? Does it still speak to all Montanans? The student filmmakers of the Humanities Through Film Summer Bridge Program present The People's House, a documentary analyzing the past and present of the state Capitol to answer the question: who's in and who's out at the people's house?</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Moderated by Asad Muhammad, American Documentary/POV's VP of Impact and Engagement Strategy, these intimate conversations will highlight the motivations and strategies of Firelight-supported filmmakers whose films – and resulting impact campaigns – have challenged historical assumptions about communities of color, reframed social discourse, and spurred audiences to action.  In conversation with Muhammad, filmmakers and #FirelightFamily Stanley Nelson and Loira Limbal will highlight the importance of impact and engagement in the life of a film, detail how Firelight Media supports the impact campaigns of our artists, and provide a lesson or two from their own impact strategies for films like The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution and Through the Night, respectively.  T?hen, filmmaker Nausheen Dadabhoy – who is a Firelight Documentary Lab alum and Impact Campaign Fund grantee – and impact producer Aber Kawas will discuss Dadabhoy's acclaimed documentary An Act of Worship, which had its broadcast premiere on POV in October. The two will discuss how the film and its impact campaign were designed to address and support the Muslim communities in the U.S. reflected in the film.  And finally, following the December 12 broadcast premiere of Let The Little Light Shine on POV, Documentary Lab alum and Impact Fund grantee Kevin Shaw will join esteemed impact producer Locsi Ferrá for a deep-dive on the motivations behind their impact strategy as well as both successes and challenges in its activation.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>For this Beyond Resilience Masterclass, supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Firelight Media collected personal documentary filmmakers and historians to discuss the transformative power of the personal. How can one photo or personal letter challenge the prevailing narrative of a historical moment? How can we, as filmmakers, think of archival materials more dynamically – not as a visual crutch, but as a main character in the story? And, finally, given the generations-long struggle of marginalized groups to tell our stories in spite of subjugation, what's the power that lies in simply having access to an archive?  Accessibility Notice: This event will included live closed captions.  Panelists:? - Bing Liu, Academy Award-nominated Filmmaker, Minding The Gap - Elleza Kelley, Assistant Professor English and African American Studies at Yale - Stanley Nelson, Academy Award-nominated Filmmaker, A Place of Our Own - Lori Pourier, President, First Peoples Fund  Moderator: - Sian-Pierre Regis, Filmmaker, Duty Free; Firelight Media Documentary Lab Alum</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The Fireburn documentary explores the inhumane conditions that existed on the island of St. Croix prior to the labor revolt and looks at the women who were called "Queens" due to their leadership. The documentary interviews historians, cultural ambassadors and educators and looks at the folklore, art and history surrounding the Fireburn. The Fireburn is a story that must be told because it is Virgin Islands' history, African Diaspora history, Danish history, US history, and Caribbean history…as such, it is World history! Yet, the Fireburn is little known outside the Virgin Islands.</Abstract>
